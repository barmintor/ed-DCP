                         THE WRITINGS


    DOUGLAS JERROLD.

ON the First of January, 1851, will commence the publication of a
                 COLLECTED EDITION
                                O F THE


 WRITINGS OF DOUGLAS JERROLD.
     Many of these remain in the piecemeal form in which they were
originally published, or lie scattered over the periodical literature of
the last fifteen years ; and as all of them, in a greater or less degree,
have achieved a popular reputation, it is hoped that their republication,
in a cheap and uniform edition, will be acceptable to the public.

  They will comprise--
          I. NOVELS.                 Ill. ESSAYS.
          II. TALES.                 IV. COMEDIES & DRAMAS.

and will probably extend to Six Volumes.

     The size adopted will be that of Mr. Dickens's cheap editions,
but the lines will extend across the page, instead of being in columns.

    The mode of publication will be in Weekly Numbers of sixteen
pages each ; in Monthly Parts ;and, finally, in Volumes.

    The price of each Number will be I t d . ; and the average of each
Volume will be about Twenty-four Numbers.
