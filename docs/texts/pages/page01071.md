can ever believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I
have believed it in the writing.

  Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I
cannot close this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a
hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again put forth
my two green leaves once a month, and with a faithful remem-
brance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these
leaves of David Copperfield, and made me happy.

    LONDON,
        October, 1850.
