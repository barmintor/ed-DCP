NUMBER ONE SAINT PAUL'S
     CHURCH-YARD.
    I t may be well just to remind new comers that Number
One St. Paul's Church-yard continues to stand prominent
in its old spot, right in the very centre of England's
metropolis, and that from this great centre of supply are
sent out eastward, westward, northward, and southward,
to all parts of London, and to the remotest districts in
the country, the very best TEAS, and the choicest
COFFEES, of the world's growth.
    Excellent Congou Tea, that never fails to give great
satisfaction, is now only 4s. the pound, whilst true and
fine-flavoured Coffee, of particularly choice quality, is sold
a t Is. 8d. a pound, by
