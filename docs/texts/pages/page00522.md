   Of these each Monthly Part, as heretofore, will contain TWO, together with one
work in Sculpture,-original and from some famous British work,-and, usually,
about Fifty Engravings on Wood,-comprising portraits of British Painters and
Sculptors; Passages from the Poets, examples of the genius and fancy of many
eminent artists; models of antique beauty; original designs for manufactures;
examples of meritorious objects in manufactured Art, actually executed; and
selcctions from the most useful models or finest works produced in the principal
cities of the Continent.
   The letter-press is contributed by many of the most eminent writers upon Art
in England and of the Continent. The large circulation of the Journal enables the
Editor to obtain the best assistance of the pen as of the pencil, so as to exhibit the
results of knowledge and experience, and the practicability of improvements, in
all matters essential to the Artist, instructive to the Amateur, profitable to the
Manufacturer, and interesting to the Public.

  I n order to meet the wishes of those who require copies of the Engravings, for
the portfolio or for framing, it has been resolved to issue A LrmrTEn NUKBER OF
PROOJS, AND IMPRESSIONS on large paper; for these early application will be neces-
sary, as they will be taken onlyfor Subscribers.
