                        O N A N O L D PICTURE.
                                                   __t__


 How that old picture brings before the eye                Would ne'er be set aside for such as those.
 The Dress peculiar t o the days gone by!                  You see by that old picture, hanging there,
 Look a t the figures! such outlandish styles              What vast improvements have been brought to bear.
 Seem fasbion'd only t o provoke to smiles.                Look at that coat! how wretchedly it fits.
 How very diff'rent were the dresses worn                  And see the vest! how awkwardly it sits.
 When that old-fashion'd picture first was drawn.          Mine (which I bought of MOSES,by the bye),
 See! there's a curious coat-and there's a bat !           In style and fit, offend not thus the eye.
 And there's a bonnie waistcoat ! look a t that!           MOSESand SONfor me ! no Tailors please
 What would be thought, if, in the present day,            In any single sense, compared with these.
 A person were t o dress in such a way?                    Their Boots and Hats, as well as their attire,
 Folks in the public streets would stand tomock            Are positively all that we require.
 And make th' eccentric man a Laughing stock.              Better I never saw, nor better want,
 Though all the fashion, fifty years ago,                  And better can't be had, depend upon't.
 They would not now pass muster-0, dear, no!               MOSESand SONfor me ! no tradesmen please,
 Mosrcs and SON'Ssuperior style in clothes                 In any single point, compared with these.
