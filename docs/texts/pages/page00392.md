                                              BY JOHN FORSTER,
                Of the Inner Temple, Barrister, Author of              " Lives    of Statesmen of the Commonwealth."

  "A fitting, and we think, a permanent companion to                         sentiment that pervades it. Attention is fixed upon the
the works of the author whose career it commemorates."
