 T  HE peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
    FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest materials, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,

  GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
   These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling a t a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
         T H E EIDER D O W N QUILT,
also, is to be seen on@ a t their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
 Qarriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                       BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, WITH PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable-
   OLD FEATHER-BEDS re-dressed by this process are perfectly freed from all
impurities ; and, by expanding the Feathers, the bulk is greatly increased, and the
Bed consequently rendered much fuller and softer, a t 3d. per lb.
  OLD AND MOTHY MATTRESSES effectually cured and re-made.
  Every description of BLANKETS, QUILTS, and SHEETINGS.


      HEAL AND SON'S LIST OF BEDDING
                             CONTAINS FULL PARTICULARS O F

                 WEIGHTS, SIZES, AND PRICES,
 Of every description of Bedding, and is so arranged that purchasers are enabled to
judge of the articles best suitable to make a comfortable Bed.

                                                  BY   VARIOUS WRITERS.

                            EDITED
                                 BY DR. WILLIAM SMITH.
                         Complete in Three Volumes medium Svo, f 5 15s. 6d. cloth lettered.
   "The book i s condensed well-digested, well-proportioned, and, considering the extent of subject wonderfully
complete. There is nothin; superfluous either in matter or style. There was too much to be said,'and too little
space to put i t in, to allow the privilege of diffuseness t o a n y of the writers. The hook is the reverse of pedanticsl or
merely scholastic i n its tone, and is in fact designed for every class of readers. Whether the school-boy seeks his
first acquaintance with its historicaiand mithic personages, or the student desires larger views to correct his first
impressions, or the man of more mature years would recall the knowledge of his youth to obtain examples and com-
parisons for the business of life, the Dictionary will be acceptable to all. W e can imagine no one from whom it does
not challenge eager welcome."-Examiner.

Given in detail, and adapted to the objects of persons in every station of life ; so that the Cottager, with a few

 conduce to the pleasure of his Employer. 'Woodcuts are given whenever the matter treated of requires that
 mode of Illustration.

    Lastly, that description of Domestic and Political News is introduced which is usually found in a
 Weekly Newspaper. It is unnecessary to dwell on this head further than to say, that the proprietor^ do not
 range themselves under the banners of any Party ; their earnest endeavours are to make THE GARDENEES'

 true sense of the word-leaving the Reader to form his own opinions; their object being the elucidation of the

Experience, extending over twenty years, enables them to o5er many advantagesin quality and price. I n large
Mercantile Establishments, the Stationery Department, whilst i t involves a considerable outlay, and interferes
greatly with the comfort of those employed, seldom receives the attention which its importance demands,
from the fact of few Stationers having combined under one Establishment, Printing i n LETTER-PRESS.
LITHOGRAPHY and COPPER-PLATE, the Manufacture of ACCOUNT-BOOKS, and the supply of the more
minute articles for the Office, in addition to the various descriptions of Paper.

is e x t e h v e ; and in thus striking a t the root of an evil that has hitherto met with but little opposition, Nlsssn

with their confidence, that all orders will be executed with the greatest dispatch, and with strict attention to
the beauty of the work, and also with a desire t o exchange or take back,all goods that may not meet with
thorough approbation.-Upwards of one hundred banking-houses are supphed from thls establishment.

   The Directors have much pleasure i n laying before the Members, in their Thirteenth Annual Report, the following
statement of the business of the Institution during the past year :-
   In that period 1673 proposals for assurance have been submitted to the Board ; of these. 1423 have been accepted,
and policies thereonissued, the annual premiums on which amount t o 3 2 4 , 4 7 5 5s. ad. ; 137 more havebeenaccepted,
but the policies have not been completed; the remaining 113 proposals the directors have deemed it prudent
to decline.
   The annual income has increased to 6 1 2 6 , 2 3 2 7 s . 6 d . , notwithstanding the reduction on premiums, amounting to
the sum of %10,716 3s. 6d., allowed to those members who choose this mode of appropriating the profits.
   The total amount of bonuses assigned in 1847, to policies on which the original prenliums continue to be paid,
is 837,834 4s., in addition to the sums assigned in 1842.
   The accounts to the 20th November last have been duly audited ; the balance of receipts over disbursements for
the gear is 6 7 2 , 8 5 5 19s. 3d., making the capital stock of the Institution a t that date &amp;440,028 15s. Sd., which i s
invested in real and government securities.
   The sums paid for claims on policies of deceased members from the commencement of the Institution, including
the bonuses assigned thereto, amount to 8 1 1 1 , 3 3 9 10s. I d . , of which, 8 1 6 , 2 6 0 10s. has been paid within the last
twelve months, and the sum of 6 7 , 7 4 9 , not yet applied for, remains due on Lhis account.
   The foregoing summary, exhibiting such successful results in the short space of thirteen pears, attests both the
prosperity and usefulness of the Institution, and the peculiar advantages afforded by the entirely Mutual System of
Assurance on which it is founded.
   The following instances illustrate the Reduction i n Premiums and equivalent Bonuses on Policies in Class 9,
payable at death.

    that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.
To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born
(as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at
night. I t was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began
to cry, simultaneously.
   I n consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by
the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken
a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of
our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be
unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and
spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all
unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a
Friday night.
   I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show
better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified
by the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only
remark, that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I
was still a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all
complain of having been kept out of this property; and if anybody
else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to
keep it.
   I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers,
at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going people were
short of money about that time, or were short of faith and preferred
cork-jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but one
solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-
broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance in
                                                               B

 sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain.
 Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss-for as to
 sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the market then-and
 ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our
 part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner
 to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to
 have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being
 disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady
 with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated
 five shillings, d l in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny short-as it took
 an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to endeavour without
 any effect to prove to her. I t is a fact which will be long remembered
as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died tri-
umphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was,
to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in
her lifc, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was
extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the
impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go
"meandering" about the world. It was in vain to represent to her
that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this ob-
jectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and
with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, "Let us
have no meandering."
    Not to meander, myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.
    I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or "thereby," as they say in
 Scotland. I was a postlumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon
the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is
something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw
me ; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have
of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the church-
yard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out done
there in the dark night, when our little parlor was warm and bright with
f i e and candle, and the doors of our house were-almost cruelly, i t seemed
to me sometimes-bolted and locked against it.
    An aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of
whom I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate
of our family. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always
called her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable
personage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married
to a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the
sense of the homely adage, "handsome is, that handsome doesH-for he
was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having
once, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined
arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. These
evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay
him off, and effect a separation by mutual consent. H e went to India
with his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he
was once seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but
I think it must have been a Baboo-or a Begum. Any how, from India

  tidings of his death reached home, within ten years. How they affected
  my aunt, nobody knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took
 her maiden name again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a
 long way off, established herself there as a single woman with one servant,
 and was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible
 retirement.
     My father had once been a favorite of hers, I believe; but she was
 mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was
 " a wax doll."     She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be
 not yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. H e was
 double my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitu-
 tion. H e died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I
 came into the world.
     This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be
 excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no
 claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood ; or to have
 any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what
 follows.
     My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low
 in spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about
 herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by some
 grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer up-stairs, to a world not at all excited
on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting by the fire,
that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and very doubtful
of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her, when, lifting her
eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she saw a strange lady
coming up the garden.
    My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was Miss
Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the
garden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity
of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to
nobody else.
    When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity.
My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any
ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and
looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against
the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became
perfectly flat and white in a moment.
    She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I
am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been-born on a Friday.
    My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in
the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and enquiringly,
began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head in
a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown
and a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed,
to come and open the door. My mother went.
    " Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,"      said Miss Betsey ; the emphasis
referring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition.
    " Yes," said my mother, faintly.

T             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPRRIENCE

    " Miss Trotwood," said the visitor. "You have heard of her, I dare
say ?"
   My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a dis-
agreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an
overpowering pleasure.
    " Now you see her," said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and
begged her to walk in.
    They went into the parlor my mother had come from, the fire in the
best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted-not having
been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral ; and when they were both
seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to
restrain herself, began to cry.
    " Oh tut, tut, tut !" said Miss Betsey, in a hurry.      " Don't do that!
Come, come !"
    My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had
had her cry out.
    " Take off your cap, child," said Miss Betsey, " and let me see you."

    My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this
odd request, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as
she was told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was
luxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.
    " Why, bless my heart !" exclaimed Miss Betsey.         " You are a very
Baby !"
    My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even
for her years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing,
and said, sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish
widow, and would be but a childish mother if she lived. I n a short
pause which ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her
hair, and that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid
hope, she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up,
her hands folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning     - at
the fire.
    &lt;' I n the name of Heaven," said Miss Betsey, suddenly, " why Rookery ? "
    "DO you mean the house, ma'am? " asked my mother.
    "Why Rookery ? " said Miss Betsey. " Cookery would have been
more to the purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of Life, either of
y OU."
    &lt;&lt;Thename was Mr. Copperfield's choice," returned my mother.
 "When he bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks
about it."
    The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall
 old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor
 Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one
 another, like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds
 of such repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as
 if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,
 some weather-beaten ragged old rooksy-nests, burdening their higher
 branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.
     "Where are the birds? " asked Miss Betsey.

                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   "The -?"            My mother had been thinking of something else.
   "The rooks-what has become of them ?" asked Miss Betsey.
   "There have not been any since we have lived here," said my mother.
"We thought-Mr. Copperfield thought-it was quite a large rookery ;
but the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a
long while."
    &lt;&lt;DavidCopperfield all over ! " cried Miss Betsey. "David Copper-
field from head to foot ! Calls a house a rookery when there 's not a rook
near it, and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests ! "
    " Mr. Copperfield," returned my mother, " is dead, and if you dare to

speak unkindly of him to me-"
   My poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of
committing an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have
settled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better
training for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed
with the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very
meekly, and fainted.
   When she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,
whichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The
twilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as
they saw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the
fire.
    "Well ? " said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only
been taking a casual look at the prospect ; " and when do you expect-"
    " I am all in a tremble," falteredmy mother.      " I don't know what 's

the matter. I shall die, I am sure ! "
    "No, no, no," said Miss Betsey. " Have some tea."
    " Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good ? " cried
my mother in a helpless manner.
    " Of course i t will,"    said Miss Betsey . " I t 's nothing but fancy.
What do you call your girl ? "
    " I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am," said my mother

innocently.
    "Bless the Baby ! " exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the
second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer up-stairs, but applying
it to my mother instead of me, "I don't mean that. I mean your
servant-girl."
    "Peggotty," said my mother.
    " Peggotty !" repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation.      " Do you
mean to say, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church,
and got herself named Peggotty ? "
    " I t ' s her surname," said my mother, faintly.  "Mr. Copperfield called
her by it, because her Christian name was the same as mine."
    " Here ! Peggotty !" cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlor-door. " Tea.
Your mistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle."
    Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had
been a recognised authority in the house ever since it had been a house,
and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the
passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut

 the door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the
 skirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee.
     "You were speaking about its being a girl," said Miss Betsey. "I
 have no doubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a
 girl. Now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl-"
     "Perhaps boy," my mother took the liberty of putting in.
     " I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl," returned
 Miss Betsey. "Don't contradict. Prom the moment of this girl's birth,
 child, I intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg
 you'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes
in life with this Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with her
affections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded
from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I
must make that my care."
    There was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these sentences,
as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any
plainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,
at least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire : too much
scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and be-
wildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what
to say.
    "And was David good to you, child ? " asked Miss Betsey, when she
had been silent for a little while, and these motions of her head had
gradually ceased. "Were you comfortable together? "
    "We were very happy," said my mother. " Mr. Copperfield was only
too good to me."
    " What, he spoilt you, I suppose ? " returned Miss Betsey.
    "For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world
again, yes, I fear he did indeed," sobbed my mother.
    " Well ! Don't cry! " saidMiss Betsey. " You were not equally matched,
child-if     any two people can be equally matched-and so I asked the
question. You were an orphan, weren't you?"
    r' Yes."
    " And a governess ?"
    " I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to

visit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of
notice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed
to me. And I accepted him. And so we were married," said my mother
simply.
    " Ha ! poor Baby !" mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon
the fire. " Do you know anything ?"
    " I beg your pardon, ma'am," faltered my mother.

    "About keeping house, for instance," said Miss Betsey.
    " Not much, I fear," returned my mother.     "Not so much as I could
wish. But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me-"
    (" Much he knew about it himself! ") said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.
   -" And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn,
and he very patient to teach, if the great misfortune of his death "-my
mother broke down again here, and could get no farther.

                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   '[Well, well !" said Miss Betsey.
   -&lt;&lt;     I kept my housekeeping-book regularly, and balanced it with Mr.
  Copperfield every night," cried my mother in another burst of distress,
  and breaking down again.
     " Well, well !" said Miss Betsey. " Don't cry any more."
     -a    And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it,
  except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too
  muchlike each other, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,"
  resumed my mother in another burst, and breaking down again.
     " You'll make yourself ill," said Miss Betsey, "and you know that will
  not be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come ! You mustn't
  do it ! "
     This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her
 increasing indisposition perhaps had a larger one. There was an interval
  of silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating " H a ! "
 as she sat with her feet upon the fender.
     " David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,"

  said she, by and by. " What did he do for you? "
     " Mr. Copperfield," said my mother, answering with some difficulty,
  "was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it
 to me."
     " How much? " asked Miss Betsey.
     "A hundred and five pounds a year," said my mother.
     " H e might have done worse," said my aunt.
    The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much
 worse that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing
 at a glance how ill she was,-as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if
 there had been light enough,-conveyed her up-stairs to her own room
 with all speed ; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew,
 who had been for some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my
 mother, as a special messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse
 and doctor.
    Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived
within a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of portentous
 appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied over her left arm,
 stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty knowing nothing
 about her, and my mother saying nothing about her, she was quite a
mystery in the parlor ; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers'
 cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article in her ears in that way, did
not detract from the solemnity of her presence.
    The doctor having been up-stairs and come down again, and having
 satisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this unknown
lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some hours, laid
himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of his sex, the
mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to take up the
less space. H e walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet, and more
slowly. H e carried his head on one side, partly in modest depreciation
of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody else. It is nothing
to say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He couldn't have

throw% a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one gently,
or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as he walked ;
but he wouldn't have been rude to him, and he couldn't have been
quick with him, for any earthly consideration.
   Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt, with his head on one side,
and making her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as
he softly touched his left ear :
   " Some local irritation, ma'am ? "

   "What! " replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like
a cork.
   Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness-as he told my mother
afterwards-that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind.
But he repeated, sweetly :
   " Some local irritation, ma'am ? "

   " Nonsense !" replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one

blow.
   Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,
as she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called up-stairs again.
After some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned.
   "Well?" said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest
to him.
   " Well, ma'am," returned Mr. Chillip, "we are-we are progressing
slowly, ma'am."
   " Ba-a-ah       ! " said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous
interjection. And corked herself, as before.
   Really-really-as      Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked ;
speaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked.
But he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours, as
she sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After another
absence, he again returned.
   " Well ? " said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.

   " Well, ma'am," returned Mr. Chillip, " we are-we           are progressing
slowly, ma'am."
   " Ya-a-ah!"        said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip
absolutely could not bear it. I t was really calculated to break his spirit,
he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs, in the
dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.
   Ham Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very
dragon at his catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible
witness, reported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlor-door
an hour after this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking
to and fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make
his escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices
overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the circum-
stance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to
expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest. That,
marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had been
taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled his
hair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded them

with her own, and otherwise touzled and maltreated him. This was in
part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half-past twelve o'clock,
soon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was.
   The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if
at any time. He sidled into the parlor as soon as he was at liberty, and
said to my aunt in his meekest manner :
   "Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you."
   "What upon ? " said my aunt, sharply.
   Mr. Chillipwas fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's
manner ; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to mollify
her.
   " Mercy on the man, what's he doing ! " cried my aunt, impatiently.
" Can 't he speak? "
   "Be calm, my dear ma'am," said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.
" There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am.     Be calm."
   I t has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn 't shake
him, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own
head at him, but in a way that made him quail.
    "Well, ma'am," resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, " I
am happy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well over."
   During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery
of this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.
   " How is she?" said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still

tied on one of them.
   " Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope," returned

Mr. Chillip. " Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to
be, under these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any
objection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. I t may do her good."
   " And she. How is she ?" said my aunt, sharply.
    Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my
aunt like an amiable bird.
   " The baby," said my aunt. " How is she ?"
   '&lt; Ma'am," returned Mr. Chillip, " I apprehended you had known.
It's a boy."
   My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in
the manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put
it on bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a dis-
contented fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it
was popularly supposed I was entitled to see ; and never came back any
more.
    No. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey
Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows,
the tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light
upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all
such travellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once
was he, without whom I had never been.

               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                             CHAPTER 11.
                                I OBSERVE.

    THEfirst objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look
 far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty
 hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so
 dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,
 and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't
 peck her in preference to apples.
    I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed
 to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going
 unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind
 which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of
 Peggotty's fore-finger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being
 roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.
    This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go
 farther back into such times than many of us suppose ; just as I believe
 the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite
 wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most
 grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater pro-
priety be said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it ; the
rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness, and
gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an inheritance
they have preserved from their childhood.
    I might have a misgiving that I am "meandering " in stopping to say
this, but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in
part upon my own experience of myself ; and if it should appear from any-
thing I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observa-
tion, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I
undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.
   Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first
objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of
things, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let
me see.
   There comes out of the cloud, our house-not new to me, but quite
familiar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's
kitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in the
centre, without any pigeons in it ; a great dog-kennel in a corner, without
any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me, walking
about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who
gets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as I
look at him through the kitchen-window, who makes me shiver, he is so
fierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me
with their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at night :
as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.

                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            11
      Here is a long passage-what an enormous perspective I make of it!-
   leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front-door. A dark store-room
   opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at night ; for I don't
  know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea-chests, when
  there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light, letting a mouldy air
  come out at the door, in which there is the smell of soap, pickles, pepper,
   candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then there are the two parlors : the
  parlor in which we sit of an evening, my mother and I and Peggotty-
  for Peggotty is quite our companion, when her work is done and we are
  alone-and the best parlor where we sit on a Sunday ; grandly, but not
  so comfortably. There is something of a doleful air about that room to
  me, for Peggotty has told me-I don't know when, but apparently ages
  go-about myfather's funera1,and the company having their black cloaks put
  on. One Sunday night my mother reads to Peggotty and me in there,
  how Lazarus was raised up from the dead. And I am so frightened that
  they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed, and shew me the quiet
  churchyard out of the bedroom window, with the dead all lying in their
  graves at rest, below the solemn moon.
     There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of
  that churchyard ; nothing half so shady as its trees ; nothing half so quiet
  as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up, early
 in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my mother's room, to
 look out at it ; and I see the red light shining on the sun-dial, and think
 within myself, cc I s the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that it can tell the time
 again ? "
     Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a
 window near it, out of which our house can be seen, and is seen many
 times during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make her-
 self as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames.
 But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does,
 and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the
 clergyman. But I can't always look at him-I know him without that
 white thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and
perhaps stopping the service to enquire-and what am I to do? It's
a dreadful thing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my
mother, but she pretends not to see me.            I look at a boy in the
aisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at
the open door through the porch, and there I see a stray sheep-I don't
mean a sinner, but mutton-half making up his mind to come into the
 church. I feel that if I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted
to say something out loud; and what would become of me then ! I
look up at the monumental tablets on the wall, and try to think of
Mr. Bodgers late of this parish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must
have been, when affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physi-
cians were in vain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he
was in vain; and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week.
I look from Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit;
and think what a good place it would be to play in, and what a castle
it would make, with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and

having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head.
 I n time my eyes gradually shut u p ; and, from seeming to hear the
 clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I
 fall off the seat with a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive,- by-
 Peggotty.
    And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed bedroom-
windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the ragged
 old rooksy-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front
 garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the yard where the
 empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are-a very preserve of butterflies, as
 I rcmember it, with a high fence, and a gate and padlock ; where the
fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than fruit has ever been since,
in any other garden, and where my mother gathers some in a basket,
while I stand by, bolting furtive gooseberries, and trying to lookunmoved.
A great wind rises, and the summer is gone in a moment. We are
playing in the winter twilight, dancing about the parlor. When my
mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow-chair, I watch her
winding her bright curls round her fingers, and straitening her waist, and
nobody knows better than I do that she likes to look so well, and is proud
of being so pretty.
    That is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that
we were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most
things to her direction, were among the first opinions-if they may be so
called-that I ever derived from what I saw.
    Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlor fire, alone. I
had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read
very perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I
remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were a sort
of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy ; but having leave, as a
high treat, to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening
at a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon my post (of course) than
have gone to bed. I had reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty
seemed to swell and grow immensely large. I propped my eyelids open
with my two forefingers, and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at
work; at the little bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread-how
old it looked, being so wrinkled in all directions !-at the little house with
a thatched roof, where the yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a
sliding lid, with a view of Saint Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted
on the top ; at the brass thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I
thought lovely. I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything,
for a moment, I was gone.
    "Peggotty," says I, suddenly, "were you ever married?"
    " Lord, Master Davy," replied Peggotty. "What 's put marriage in
your head !"
    She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she
stopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its
thread's length.
    " But were you ever married, Peggotty ? " says I. " You are a very
handsome woman, an't you ?"

   I thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly ; but of
another school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There was
a redvelvet footstool in the best parlor, on which my mother had painted
a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty's complexion,
appeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was smooth,
and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference.
   " Me handsome, Davy !" said Peggotty. " Lawk, no, my dear ! But
what put marriage in your head ? "
   " I don't know !-You mustn't marry more than one person at a time,
may you, Peggotty ?"
   " Certainly not," says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.
   "But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may
marry another person, mayn't you, Peggotty ? "
   "You MAY," says Peggotty, "if you choose, my dear. That's a
matter of oninion." -
   r c But wcat is your opinion, Peggotty ? " said I.
   I asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so curiously
at me.
    " My opinion is," said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little
indecision and going on with her work, "that I never was married myself,
Master Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's all I know about the
subject."
   " You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you? " said I, after sitting
quiet for a minute.
   I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was
quite mistaken : for she laid aside her work, (which was a stocking of her
own,) and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and
gave it a good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being
very plump, whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed,
some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recol-

           bursting to the opposite side of the parlor, while she was
hugging me.
   " Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills," said Peggotty,

who was not quite right in the name yet, " for I an't heard half
enou~h."
---.  -~
       Q-
   I couldn't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or why she
was so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those
monsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in
the sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled
them by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on
account of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,
as natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in
short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did at least; but I had my
doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various
parts of her face and arms, all the time.
   We had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when
the garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my
mother, looking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman
with beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from
church last Sunday.

14            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    As my mother stooped down on the threshhold to take me in her arms
 and kiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little
 fellow than a monarch-or something like that ; for my later understanding
 comes, I am sensible, to my aid here.
    " What does that mean ? " I asked him, over her shoulder.
    H e patted me on the head ; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep
 voice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in
 touching me-which it did. I put it away, as well as I could.
    " Oh Davy ! " remonstrated my mother.
    " Dear boy ! " said the gentleman. " I cannot wonder at his devotion!"
    I never saw such a beautiful color on my mother's face before. She
 gently chid me for being rude ; and, keeping me close to her shawl, turned
to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home.
She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with his own,
she glanced, I thought, at me.
    " Let us say ' good night,' my fine boy," said the gentleman, when he
had bent his head-1 saw him !-over my mother's little glove.
    " Good night !" said I.

    " Come ! Let us be the best friends in the world ! " said the gentleman,
laughing. " Shake hands ! "
   My right hand was in my mother's left, so I gave him the other.
    " Why that's the wrong hand, Davy ! " laughed the gentleman.
    My mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my
former reason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him the other, and
he shook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away.
    At this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last
look with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut.
   Peggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured the
fastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlor. My mother, con-
trary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the fire,
remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.
    "-Hope     you have had a pleasant evening, ma'am," said Peggotty,
standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick
in her hand.
    "Much obliged to you, Peggotty," returned my mother, in a cheerful
voice, " I have had a very pleasant evening."
   "A stranger or so makes an agreeable change," suggested Peggotty.
   " A very agreeable change indeed," returned my mother.

   Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room,
and my mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so
sound asleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.
When I half awoke from this uncomfortable dose, I found Peggotty and
my mother both in tears, and both talking.
   "Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked," said
Peggotty. "That I say, and that I swear !"
   " Good Heavens ! " cried my mother.       " You '11 drive me mad ! Was
ever any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am ! Why do I do
myself the injustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married,
Peggotty ?"

   " God knows you have, ma'am," returned Peggotty.
     " Then how can you dare," said my mother-" you know I don't mean
  how can you dare, Peggotty, but how can you have the heart-to make me
  so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me, when you are well
  aware that I haven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to ! "
     a The more 's the reason," returned Peggotty, " for saying that it
 won't do. No ! That it won't do. No ! No price could make it do.
 No ! "-I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away,
 she was so emphatic with it.
    "How can you be so aggravating," said my mother, shedding
 more tears than before, " as to talk in such an unjust manner ! How
 can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when I tell
 you over and over again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest
 civilities nothing has passed! You talk of admiration. What am I
 to do ? If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault ?
 What am I to do, I ask you? Would you wish me to shave my head
 and black my face, or disfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something
 of that sort ? I dare say you would, Peggotty. I dare say you 'd quite
 enjoy it."
    Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought.
    "And my dear boy," cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair in
 which I was, and caressing me, "my own little Davy ! I s it to be hinted
to me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest
little fellow that ever was ! "
    " Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing," said Peggotty.
    "You did, Peggotty !" returned my mother. " You know you did.
What else was it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature,
when you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I
wouldn't buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed
the whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy. You know it is,
Peggotty. You can't deny it." Then, turning affectionately to me, with
her cheek against mine, " Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy ? Am I a
nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama ? Say I am, my child ; say 'yes ;' dear boy,
and Peggotty will love you, and Peggotty's love is a great deal better
than mine, Davy. I dont love you at all, do I ? "
    At this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest of the
party, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was quite heart-
broken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded ten-
derness I called Peggotty a " Beast." That honest creature was in deep
aflhction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless on the
occasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off, when, after
having made it up with my mother, she kneeled down by the elbow-
chair, and made it up with me.
    We went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for a long
time; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed, I found
my mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me. I fell asleep in
her arms, after that, and slept soundly.
   Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again,
or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared, I

16            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

cannot recal. I don't profess to be clear about dates. But there he was,
in church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too, to
look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlor-window. I t did not
appear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked
my mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose
it for himself, but he refused to do that-I could not understand why-
so she plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would
never, never, part with it any more ; and I thought he must be quite a fool
not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.
    Peggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always
been. My mother deferred to her very much-more than usual, it occurred
to me-and we were all three excellent friends; still we were different
from what we used to be, and were not so comfortable among our-
selves. Sometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my
mother's wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her
going so often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, to my
satisfaction, make out how it was.
    Gradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black
whiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy
jealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child's instinctive
 dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make much of my
mother without any help, it certainly was not the reason that I might have
 found if I had been older. No such thing came into my mind, or near
 it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were ; but as to making a net of
 a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it, that was, as
 yet, beyond me.
    One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when
 Mr. Murdstone-I knew him by that name now-came by, on horseback.
 H e reined up his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to
 Lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht, and
 merrily proposed t o take me on the saddle before him if I would like the
 ride.
    The air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the idea
 of the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the
 garden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent up-stairs to
 Peggotty to be made spruce ; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone dis-
 mounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over his arm, walked slowly
 up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while my mother
 walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company. I recol-
 lect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I recol-
 lect how closely they appeared to be examining the sweetbriar between
 them, as they strolled along ; and how, from being in a perfectly angelic
  temper, Peggotty turned cross in a moment, and brushed my hair the
  wrong way, excessively hard.
     Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green
  turf by the side of the road. H e held me quite easily with one arm,
  and I don't think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my
  mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, and
  looking up in his face. H e had that kind of shallow black eye-I want

a better word to express an eye that has no depth i n it to be looked into-
which, when it is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be dis-
figured, for a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced
at him, I observed that appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what
he was thinking about so closely. His hair and whiskers were blacker
and thicker, looked at so near, than even I had given them credit for
being. A squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted
indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me
of the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-
year before. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black,
and brown, of his complexion- confound his complexion, and his
memory !-made        me think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very
handsome man. I have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought
him so too.
    We went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking
cigars in a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four
chairs, and had a large rough jacket on. I n a corner was a heap of coats
and boat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.
    They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when
we came in, and said " Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were
 dead ! "
    "Not yet," said Mr. Murdstone.
    " And who's this shaver? " said one of the gentlemen, taking hold
of me.
    " That's Davy," returned Mr. Murdstone.

    " Davy who ? " said the gentleman.     " Jones ? "

    " Copperfield," said Mr. Murdstone.

    " What ! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield's incumbrance ? " cried the
 gentleman. " The pretty little widow ? "
     " Quinion," said Mr. Murdstone, " take care, if you please. Somebody's
 sharp."
     " Who is ? " asked the gentleman, laughing.
    I looked up, quickly; being curious to know.
    " Only Brooks of Sheffield," said Mr. Murdstone.
    I was quite relieved to find it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for, as
 first, I really thought it was I.
    There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of
 Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he
 was mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After
 some laughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said :
     "And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the
 projected business ? "
     " Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at pre-

 sent," replied Mr. AEnrdstone; "but he is not generally favourable, I
 believe."
     There was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring
 the bell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did;
 and when the wine came, he made me have a little, with a biscuit, an$
 before I drank it, stand up and say "Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield !

18             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 The toast was received with great applause, and such hearty laughter that
it made me laugh too; at which they laughed the more. I n short, we
quite enjoyed ourselves.
   We walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, and
looked at things through a telescope-I could make out nothing myself
when it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could-and then we came
back to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time we were out, the two
gentlemen smoked incessantly-which, I thought, if I might judge from the
smell of their roughcoats, they must have been doing, ever since the coatshad
first come home from the tailor's. I must not forget that we went on
board the yacht, where they all three descended into the cabin, and were busy
with some papers. I saw them quite hard at work, when I looked down
through the open skylight. They left me, during this time, with a very nice
man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it,
who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on, with " Skylark " in capital
letters across the chest. I thought it was his name; and that as he lived
on board ship and hadn't a street-door to put his name on, he put it
there instead; but when I called him Mr. Skylark, he said it meant the
vessel.
   I observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the
two gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked freely with
one another, but seldom with him. I t appeared to me that he was more
clever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with some-
thing of my own feeling. I remarked that once or twice when Mr.
Quinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to make
sure of his not being displeased ; and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the
other gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod upon his foot, and gave him
a secret caution with his eyes, to observe Mr. &amp;!turdstone, who was sitting
stern and silent. Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed at all
that day, except at the Sheffield joke-and that, by the by, was his
own.
   MTe went home early in the evening. I t was a very fine evening, and
my mother and he had another stroll by the sweet-briar, while I was sent
in to get my tea, When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the
day I had had, and what they had said and done. I mentioned what they
had said about her, and she laughed, and told me they were impudent
fellows who talked nonsense-but I knew it pleased her. I knew it quite
as well as I know it now. I took the opportunity of asking if she was
at all acquainted with Nr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered
No, only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork
way.
   Can I say of her face-altered as I have reason to remember it,
perished as I know i t is-that it is gone, when here it comes before me at
this instant, as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a
crowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it
faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell
that night ? Can I say she ever changed, when my remembrance brings
her back to life, thus only ; and, truer to its loving youth than I have been,
or man ever is, still holds fast what it cherished then?

                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                              19
    I write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk,
 and she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully by the
 side of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing,
 said :
    'c What was it they said, Davy ?      Tell me again. I can't believe it."
    " ' Bewitching-'       " I began.
    My mother put her hands upon her lips to stop me.
    " It was never bewitching," she said, laughing. '&lt; It never could have
been bewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn't !"
    "Yes it was. 'Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield,"' I repeated stoutly.
 " And 'pretty.' "
    " No no, it was never pretty.         Not pretty," interposed my mother,
 laying her fingers on my lips again.
    " Yes it was. ' Pretty little widow.' "
    " What foolish, impudent creatures !" cried my mother, laughing and
covering her face. "What ridiculous men ! An't they? Davy dear-"
    " Well, Ma."

    "Don't tell Peggotty ; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully
 angry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn't know."
    I promised, of course ; and we kissed one another over and over again,
 and I soon fell fast asleep.
   I t seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next day when
Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am about to
mention ; but it was probably about two months afterwards.
   We were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out
as before), in company with the stocking and the yard measure, and the
bit of wax, and the box with Saint Paul's on the lid, and the crocodile
book, when Peggotty, after looking at me several times, and opening
her mouth as if she were going to speak, without doing it-which I
thought was merely gaping, or I should have been rather alarmed-said
coaxingly :
    "Master Davy, how should you like to go along with me and spend a
fortnight at my brothcr's at Yarmouth? Wouldn't tAat be a treat? "
   " I s your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty? " I enquired, pro-
visionally.
    " Oh what an agreeable man he is ! " cried Peggotty, holding up her
hands. "Then there's the sea; and the boats and ships; and the
fishermen ; and the beach ; and Am to play with-"
    Peggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned in my first chapter ;ut
she spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar.
    I was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it woula
indeed be a treat, but what would my mother say?
    "Why then I'll as good as bet a guinea," said Peggotty, intent uponmy
face, " that she '11 let us go. I 1' 1 ask her, if you like, as soon as ever she
comes home. There now ! "
   " But what 's she to do while we 're away ? " said I, putting my small

elbows on the table to argue the point. " She can 't live by herself."
   If Peggotty were looking for a hole, all of a sudden, in the heel of that
stocking, i t must have been a very little one indeed, and not worth
darning.                                   c 2

              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  "    I say ! Peggotty ! She can 't live by herself, you know."
  "    Oh bless you! " said Peggotty, looking at me again at last. "Don't
you know? She's going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper.
Mrs. Grayper's going to have a lot of company."
    Oh ! If that was it, I was quite ready to go. I waited, in the utmost
impatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper's (for it was
that identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out
this great idea. Without being nearly so much surprised as I had expected,
my mother entered into it readily; and it was all arranged that night, and
my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for.
    The day soon came for our going. I t was such an early day that it
came soon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and half afraid
that an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsioil of
nature, might interpose to stop the expedition. We were to go in a
carrier's cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast. I would
have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night,
and sleep in my hat and boots.
    I t touches me nearly now, although I tell it lightly, to recollect how
eager I was to leave my happy home ; to think how little I suspected what
I did leave for ever.
    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier's cart was at the gate, and
my mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for the
old place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry. I am
 glad to know that my mother cried too, and that I felt her heart beat
against mine.
    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my mother
ran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that she might kiss me
once more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which
 she lifted up her face to mine, and did so.
    As we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to where
 she was, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved. I was
looking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business it
 was of his. Peggotty, who was also looking back on the other side,
 seemed anything but satisfied ; as the face she brought back into the cart
 denoted.
     I sat looking at Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this supposi-
 titious case : whether, if she were employed to lose me like the boy in
 the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons
 she would shed.

                            CHAPTER 111.
                           I HATE A CHANGE.
    THEcarrier's horse was the laziest horse in the world, I should hope,
and shuffled along, with his head down, as if he liked to keep the people
waiting to whom the packages were directed. I fancied, indeed, that he
 sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection, but the carrier said he
was only troubled with a cough.
    The carrier had a way of keeping his head down, like his horse, and of
drooping sleepily forward as he drove, with one of his arms on each of his
knees. I say "drove," but it struck me that the cart would have gone
to Yarmouth quite as well without him, for the horse did all that ; and as
to conversation, he had no idea of it but whistling.
    Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee, which would
have lasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by the
same conveyance. We ate a good deal, and slept a good deal. Peggotty
always went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket, her
hold of which never relaxed; and I could not have believed unless I had
heard her do it, that one defenceless woman could have snored so
much.
   We made so many deviations up and down lanes, and were such a
long time delivering a bedstead at a public-house, and calling at other
places, that I was quite tired, and very glad, when we saw Yarmouth.
I t looked rather spongey and soppy, I thought, as I carried my eye
over the great dull waste that lay across the river; and I could not
help wondering, if the world were really as round as my geography-
book said, how any part of it came to be so flat. But I reflected that
Yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles; which would account
for it.
    As we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying
a straight low line under the sky, I hinted to Peggotty that a mound
 or so might have improved i t ; and also that if the land had been a little
 more separated from the sea, and the town and the tide had not been
 quite so much mixed up, like toast and water, it would have been nicer.
 But Peggotty said, with greater emphasis than usual, that we must take
 things as we found them, and that, for her part, she was proud to call
 herself a Yarmouth Bloater.
    When we got into the street (which was strange enough to me), and
 smelt the fish, and pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors
 walking about, and the carts jingling up and down over the stones, I felt
 that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to Peg-
 gotty, who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency, and
 told me it was well known (I suppose to those who had the good fortune

there were some common colored pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture
subjects ; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without
seeing the whole interior of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view.
Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow cast
into a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these. Over the
little mantel-shelf, was a picture of the Sarah Jane lugger, built a t
Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to i t ; a work of art,
combining composition with carpentery, which I considered to be one of
the most enviable possessions that the world could afford. There were
some hooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use of which I did not divine
then; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort, which
served for seats and eked out the chairs.
    All this, I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold-child-
like, according to my theory-and then Peggotty opened a little door and
showed me my bedroom. I t was the completest and most desirable
bedroom ever seen-in the stern of the vessel ; with a little window, where
the rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass, just the right
height for me, nailed against the wall, and framed with oyster-shells ; a
little bed, which there was just room enough to get into; and a nosegay
of seaweed in a blue mug on the table. The walls were whitewashed as
white as milk, and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache
with its brightness. One thing I particularly noticed in this delightful
house, was the smell of fish ; which was so searching, that when I took
out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose, I found it smelt exactly as
if i t had wrapped up a lobster. On my imparting this discovery
in confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother dealt in
lobsters, crabs, and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these
creatures, in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another,
and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of, were usually
to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were
kept.
   We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom
I had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back,
about a quarter of a mile off. Likewise by a most beautiful little
girl (or I thought her so) with a necklace of blue beads on, who
wouldn't let me kiss her when I offered to, but ran away and hid herself.
By and by, when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs,
melted butter, and potatoes, with a chop for me, a hairy man with
a very good-natured face came home. As he called Peggotty "Lass,"
and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I had no doubt, from the
general propriety of her conduct, that he was her brother; and so he
turned out-being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty, the
master of the house.
    " Glad to see you, sir," said Mr. Peggotty. "You'll find us rough,
sir, but you '11 find us ready."
    I thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such
a delightful place.
    " How's    your Ma, sir," said Mr. Peggotty. "Did you leave her
pretty jolly ? "

              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AXD EXPERIENCE

    I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could
wish, and that she desired her compliments-which was a polite fiction
on my part.
    " I 'm much obleeged to her, I 'm sure,"     said Mr. Peggotty. c r Well
sir, if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her," nodding at
his sister, " and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of your
company."
    Having done the honors of his house in this hospitable manner,
Mr. Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water, remarking
that 'I cold would never get his muck off."        He soon returned, greatly
improved in appearance ; but so rubicund, that I couldn't help thinking
his face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs, and crawfish,-that
it went into the hot water very black, and came out very red.
   After tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the nights
being cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat
that the imagination of man could conceive. To hear the wind getting
up out at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat
outside, and to look at the fire, and think that there was no house near
but this one, and this one a boat, was like enchantment. Little Em'ly
had overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my side upon the lowest
and least of the lockers, which was just large enough for us two, and just
fitted into the chimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was
knitting on the opposite side of the fire. Peggotty at her needle-work
was as much at home with Saint Paul's and the bit of wax-candle, as if
they had never known any other roof. Ham, who had been giving me
my first lesson in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme of telling
fortunes with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of his
thumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe.
I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence.
    " Mr. Peggotty ! " says I.
    "Sir," says he.
    " Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort
of ark ? "
   Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered :
    " No, sir. I never giv him no name."
    "Who gave him that name, then? " said I, putting question number
two of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty.
    "Why, sir, his father giv it him," said Mr. Peggotty.
    " I thought you were his father ! "
    " My brother Joe was his father," said Mr. Peggotty.

    " Dead, Mr. Peggotty ? "     I hinted, after a respectful pause.
    " Drowndead," said Mr. Peggotty.
    I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father,
and began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to
anybody else there. I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind
to have it out with Mr. Peggotty.
    " Little Em'ly," I said, glancing at her. "She is your daughter, isn 't
she, Mr. Peggotty ? "
    " No, sir.   My brother in law, Tom, was her father."

    I couldn 't help it. " -Dead, Mr. Peggotty ? " I hinted, after another
respectful silence.
    " Drowndead," said Mr. Peggotty.
    I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the
bottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow. So I said :
    " Havn 't you any children, Mr. Peggotty ? "

    " No, master," he answered with a short laugh. " I 'm a bacheldore."
    " A bachelor ! "    I said, astonished. " Why, who 's that, Mr. Peg-
gotty ? " Pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting.
    " That's Missis Gummidge," said Mr. Peggotty.
    " Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty ?"
    But at this point Peggotty-I mean my own peculiar Peggotty-
made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions,
that I could only sit and look at all the silent company, until it
was time to go to bed. Then, in the privacy of my own little cabin,
she informed me that Ham and Em'ly were an orphan nephew and
niece, whom my host had at different times adopted in their child-
hood, when they were left destitute ; and that Mrs. Gummidge was
the widow of his partner in a boat, who had died very poor. EIe
was but a poor man himself, said Peggotty, but as good as gold
and as true as steel-those were her similies. The only subject, she
informed me, on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore an
oath, was this generosity of his; and if it were ever referred to, by any
one of them, he struck the table a heavy blow with his right hand (had
split it on one such occasion), and swore a dreadful oath that he would
be ' Gormed' if he didn't cut and run for good, if it was ever men-
tioned again. It appeared, in answer to my inquiries, that nobody
had the least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb passive to be
gormed; but that they all regarded it as constituting a most solemn
imprecation.
    I was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened to the
 women's going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end
 of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves
 on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, in a very luxurious state of
 mind, enhanced by my being sleepy. As slumber gradually stole upon
 me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the flat so
 fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the
 night. But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after all; and that a
 man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything
 did happen.
    Nothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as it
 shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out
 with little Em'ly, picking up stones upon the beach.
    " You're quite a sailor, I suppose ? " I said to Em'ly. I don't know
 that I supposed any thing of the kind, but I felt it an act of gallantry to
 say something; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little
 image of itself, at the moment, in her bright eye, that it came into my head
 to say this.
     " No," replied Em'ly, shaking her head, " I'm afraid of the sea."

26            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    "Afraid !" I said, with a becoming air of boldness, and looking very
 big at the mighty ocean. "Ia'nt ! "
    "Ah ! but it's cruel," said Em'ly. " I have seen it very cruel to some
 of our men. I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, all to pieces."
    "I hope i t was'nt the boat that -"
    " That father was drownded in ?" said Em'ly. " No. Not that one, I
never see that boat."
    " Nor him ?" I asked her.
    Little Em'ly shook her head. " Not to remember ! "
    Here was a coincidence ! I immediately went into an explanation how
 I had never seen my own father; and how my mother and I had always
lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and lived so then, and
always meant to live so ; and how my father's grave was in the churchyard
near our house, and shaded by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I
had walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning. But
there were some differences between Em'ly's orphanhood and mine, it ap-
peared. She had lost her mother before her father; and where her father's
grave was no one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of the
sea.
    "Besides," said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles,
" your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father
was a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman's daughter, and my uncle
Dan is a fisherman.
    " Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he ? " said I.
    " Uncle Dan-yonder," answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house.
    "Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think? "
    " Good? " said Em'ly.    " If I was ever to be a lady, I 'd give him a
sky-blue coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet
waistcoat, a cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of
money ."
   I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures.
I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease
in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and that I
was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat ; but I kept these
sentiments to myself.
   Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration
of these articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again,
picking up shells and pebbles.
    " You would like to be a lady ? " I said.
   Emily looked at me, and laughed and nodded "yes."
   " I should like it very much.     We would all be gentlefolks together,
then. Me, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't
mind then, when there come stormy weather.-Not for our own sakes, I
mean. We would for the poor fishermen's, to be sure, and we 'd help 'em
with money when they come to any hurt."
   This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all
improbable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it,
and little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly,
    " Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now ? "

    It was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I had seen
 a moderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my
 heels, with an awful recollection of her drowned relations. However, I
 said " No," and I added, "You don't seem to be, either, though you say
you are;"-for     she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of
 old jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon, and I was afraid of
her falling over.
    "I'm not afraid in this way," said little Em'ly. "But I wake
when it blows, and tremble to think of uncle Dan and Ham, and
believe I hear'em crying out for help. That's why I should like so
much to be a lady. But I ' m not afraid in this way. Not a bit. Look
here ! "
    She started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which pro-
truded from the place we stood upon, and overhung the deep water at
some height, without the least defence. The incident is so impressed on
my remembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form
here, I daresay, accurately as it was that day, and little Em'ly springing
forward to her destruction (as it appeared to me), with a look that I have
never forgotten, directed far out to sea.
   The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me,
and I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had uttered ; fruitlessly
in any case, for there was no one near. But there have been times since,
in my manhood, many times there have been, when I have thought, I s it
possible, among the possibilities of hidden things, that in the sudden
rashness of the child and her wild look so far off, there was any merciful
attraction of her into danger, any tempting her towards him permitted
on the part of her dead father, that her life might have a chance of
ending that day. There has been a time since when I have wondered
whether, if the life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance,
and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it, and if her pre-
servation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I ought to have
held it up to save her. There has been a time since-I            do not say
it lasted long, but it has been-when I have asked myself the question,
would it have been better for little Em'ly to have had the waters close
above her head that morning in my sight; and when I have answered
Yes, it would have been.
   This may be premature. I have set it down too soon, perhaps. But
let it stand.
   We strolled a long way, and loaded ourselves with things that we
thought curious, and put some stranded star-fish carefully back into
the water-I hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be
quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing
so, or the reverse-and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty's
dwelling. We stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to
exchange
   . .     an innocent kiss, and went in to breakfast glowing with health
and pleasure.
     Like two young mavishes," Mr. Peggotty said. I knew this meant,
in our local dialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as a com-
pliment.

28            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   Of course I was in love with little Em'ly. I am sure Iloved that baby
quite as truly, quite as tenderly, with greater purity, and more disinterest-
edness, than can enter into the best love of a later time of life, high and
ennobling as it is. I am sure my fancy raised up something round that
blue-eyed mite of a child, which etherealised, and made a very angel of
her. If, any sunny forenoon, she had spread a little pair of wings and
flown away before my eyes, I don't think I should have regarded it as
much more than I had had reason to expect.
   We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving
manner, hours and hours. The days sported by us, as if Time had not
grown up himself yet, but were a child too, and always at play. I told
Em'ly I adored her, and that unless she confessed she adored me I should
be reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword. She said she
did, and I have no doubt she did.
   As to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty in our
way, little Em'ly and I had no such trouble, because we had no future.
We made no more provision for growing older, than we did for growing
younger. We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty, who
used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little locker
side by side, " Lor ! wasn 't it beautiful ! " Mr. Peggotty smiled at us
from behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing
else. They had something of the sort of pleasure in us, I suppose,
that they might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the
Colosseum.
   I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself
so agreeable as she might have been expected to do, under the cir-
cumstances of her residence with Mr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge's was
rather a fretful disposition, and she whimpered more sometimes than
was comfortable for other parties in so small an establishment. I was
very sorry for her ; but there were moments when it would have been
more agreeable, I thought, if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient
apartment of her own to retire to, and had stopped there until her spirits
revived.
   Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public house called The Willing
Mind. I discovered this, by his being out on the second or third evening
of our visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge's looking up at the dutch clock,
between eight and nine, and saying he was there, and that, what was
more, she had known in the morning he would go there.
   Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day, and had burst into
tears in the forenoon, when the fire smoked. "I am a lone lorn creetur',"
were Mrs. Gummidge's words, when that unpleasant occurrence took
place, "and everythink goes contrairy with me."
   " Oh, it 1' 1 soon leave off," said Peggotty-I again mean our Peggotty
-" and besides, you know, it's not more disagreeable to you than to us."
   " I feel it more," said Mrs. Gnmmidge.
   I t was a very cold day, with cutting blasts of wind. Mrs. Gummidge's
peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and
snuggest in the place, as her chair was certainly the easiest, but it didn't
 suit her that day at all. She was constantly complaining of the cold, and

of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called "the creeps."
A t last she shed tears on that subject, and said again that she was " a lone
lorn creetur' and everythink went contrairy with her."
     " It is certainly very cold," said Peggotty. "Everybody must feel it so."
    rc I feel it more than other people," said Mrs. Gummidge.
     So at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately
after me, to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction.
The fish were small and bony, and the potatoes were a little burnt. We
all acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment; but
Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than we did, and shed tears again,
and made that former declaration with great bitterness.
    Accordingly, when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o'clock, this
unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner in a very wretched
and miserable condition. Peggotty had been working cheerfully. Ham
had been patching up a great pair of water-boots; and I, with little
Em'ly by my side, had been reading to them. Mrs. Gummidge had never
made any other remark than a forlorn sigh, and had never raised her eyes
since tea.
     " Well, Mates," said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, " and how are you ?"

    We all said something, or looked something, to welcome him, except
 Mrs. Gummidge, who only shook her head over her knitting.
     "What's amiss," said Mr. Peggotty, with a clap of his hands.
" Cheer up, old Mawther ! " (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.)
    Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up. She took out
an old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes ; but instead of putting
i t in her pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, and still kept it out,
ready for-use.
    " What's amiss, dame !" said Mr. Peggotty.
    " Nothing," returned Mrs. Gummidge. "You've come from The
Wrilling Mind, Dan'l P"
     " Why yes, I've took a short spell at The Willing Mind to-night," said
Mr. Peggotty.
     " I'm sorry I should drive you there," said Mrs. Gummidge.

     " Drive! I don't want no driving," returned Mr. Peggotty with an

honest laugh. " I only go too ready."
     " Very ready," said nlrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her
eyes. " Yes, yes, very ready. I am sorry it should be along of me that
you 're so ready ."
     " Along o' you? I t an't along o' you ! " said Mr. Peggotty. "Don't
ye believe a bit on it."
     " Yes, yes, it is," cried Mrs. Gummidge. " I know what I am. I
 know that I ' m a lone lorn creetur, and not only that everythink
 goes contrairy with me, but that I go contrairy with everybody. Yes,
yes. I feel more than other people do, and I show it more. It's my
 misfortun'."
     I really couldn't help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, that the
 misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides
 Mrs. Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort, only answering
 with another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up.

30            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " I an't what I could wish myself to be," said Mrs. Gummidge. " I
am far from it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me contrairy.
I feel my troubles, and they make me contrairy. I wish I did'nt feel 'em,
but I do. I wish I could be hardened to 'em, but I an't. I make the
house uncomfortable. I don't wonder at it. I've made your sister so
 all day, and Master Davy."
    Here I was suddenly melted, and roared out "No, you have'nt, Mrs
Gummidge," in great mental distress.
    " It's far from right that I should do it," said Mrs. Gummidge. " I t
an't a fit return. I had better go into the house and die. I am a lone
lorn creetur, and had much better not make myself contrairy here. If
thinks must go contrairy with me, and I must go contrairy myself, let me
go contrairy in my parish. Dan'l, I'd better go into the house, and.
die and be a riddance !"
    Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to bed.
When she was gone, Mr. Peggotty, who had not exhibited a trace of any
feeling but the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, and nodding
his head with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face,
said in a whisper :
    " She's been thinking of the old'un !"
    I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was
supposed to have fixed her mind upon, until Peggotty, on seeing me
to bed, explained that it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that
her brother always took that for a received truth on such occasions,
and that it always had a moving effect upon him. Some time after he
was in his hammock that night, I heard him myself repeat to Ham,
"Poor thing! She's been thinking of the old 'un!" And whenever
Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder
of our stay (which happened some few times), he always said the same
thing in extenuation of the circumstance, and always with the tenderest
commiseration.
    So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of
the tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and coming in,
and altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was unemployed,
he sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships, and once or
twice he took us for a row. I don't know why one slight set of impres-
sions should be more particularly associated with a place than another,
though I believe this obtains with most people, in reference especially to
the associations of their childhood. I never hear the name, or read the
name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on
the beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly leaning on my shoulder,
Ham lazily dropping stones into the water, and the sun, away at sea,
just breaking through the heavy mist, and showing us the ships, like
their own shadows.
    At last the day came for going home. I bore up against the separation
from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving
little Em'ly was piercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house
where the carrier put up, and I promised, on the road, to write to her.
(I redeemed that promise afterwards, in characters larger than those in

which apartments are usually announced in manuscript, as being to let).
We were greatly overcome at parting ; and if ever, in my life, I have had a
void made in my heart, I had one made that day.
   Now, all the time I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful to my
home again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But I was no
sooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience seemed
to point that way with a steady finger; and I felt, all the more for the
sinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and that my mother was my
comforter and friend.
   This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew,
and the more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more
excited I was to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty,
instead of sharing in these transports, tried to check them (though very
kindly), and looked confused and out of sorts.
   Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when the
carrier's horse pleased-and did. How well I recollect it, on a cold grey
afternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain !
   The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my
pleasant agitation, for my mother. I t was not she, but a strange
servant.
   " Why, Peggotty !" I said, ruefully, "isn't she come home !"

   " Yes, yes, Master Davy," said Peggotty. " She's come home. Wait
a bit, Master Davy, and 1'11-1 1  ' 1 tell you something."
   Between her agitation, and her natural awkwardness in getting out of
the cart, Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself, but I
felt too blank and strange to tell her so. When she had got down, she
took me by the hand ; led me, wondering, into the kitchen; and shut the
door.
   " Peggotty ! " said I, quite frightened.     "What 's the matter? "
   "Nothing's the matter, bless you, Master D a ~ ydear! " she answered,
assuming an air of sprightliness.
   " Something 's the matter, I 'm sure. Where's mama? "
   " Where 's mama, Master Davy ? " repeated Peggotty.
   " Yes. Why hasn 't she come out to the gate, and what have we come
in here for? Oh, Peggotty ! " My eyes were full, and I felt as if I were
going to tumble down.
   "Bless the precious boy ! " cried Peggotty, taking hold of me. " What
is it ? Speak, my pet ! "
   " Not dead, too ! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty ? "
   Peggotty cried out No ! with an astonishing volume of voice; and then
sat down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn.
   I gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another turn in
the right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in anxious
inquiry.
   "You see, dear, I should have told you before now," said Peggotty,
"but I hadn't an opportunity. I ought to have made it, perhaps, but I
couldn't azackly "-that was always the substitute for exactly, in Peggotty's
militia of words-" bring my mind to it."
   " Go on, Peggotty," said I, more frightened than before.

32            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   "Master Davy," said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking
hand, and speaking in a breathless sort of way. " What do you think?
You have got a P a ! "
   I trembled, and turned white. Something-I don't know what, or
how-connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising of the
dead, seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind.
   " A new one," said Peggotty.
   " A new one ?" I repeated.
   Peggotty gave a gasp, as if she were swallowing something that was
very hard, and, putting out her hand, said :
   " Come and see him."

   " I don't want to see him."
   - "And your mamma," said Peggotty.
   I ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlor, where
she left me. On one side of the fire, sat my mother; on the other,
Mr. Murdstone. My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, but
timidly I thought.
   " Now, Clara my dear," said Mr. Murdstone.         " Recollect ! controul

yourself, always controul yourself! Davy boy, how do you do ? "
   I gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed
my mother : she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down
again to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him, I
knew quite well that he was looking at us both; and I turned to the
window and looked out there, at some shrubs that were drooping their
heads in the cold.
   As soon as I could creep away, I crept up-stairs. My old dear bedroom
was changed, and I was to lie a long way off. I rambled down-stairs to
find anything that was like itself, so altered it all seemed; and roamed
into the yard. I very soon started back from there, for the empty dog-
kennel was filled up with a great dog-deep mouthed and black-haired
like Him-and he was very angry at the sight of me, and sprung out to
get at me.

   THEJOURNAL   OF DESIGNwill have, as it ought to have, politics of its own. I n this
matter of Ornamental Design we hope to prove ourselves thoroughly conservative of the
best interests of manufacturers, designers, and all parties concerned. W e are the
cates for better laws and a better tribunal to protect copyright in designs, and for a
largely increased extension of copyright. We think the restless demands of the public
for constant novelty are alike mischievous to the progress of good ornamental art as
they are to all comnlercial interests. W e think that the Schools of Design should be
reformed and made husiness-like realities. W e shall wage war against all pirates; and
we hope to see the day when it will be thought as disgraceful for one manufacturer to
pillage another's patterns as it is held to be if he should walk into the counting-house
and rob his till. These are some of the points of our political creed, with which we start
on our undertaking. I n conclusion, we profess that our aim is to foster ornamental art in
all its ways, and to do those things for its advance, in all its branches, which it would be
the appropriate business of a Board of Design to do, if such a useful department of
Government actually existed.

I   ANALYSIS O F THE NAME O F M O S E S &amp; SON.

!      ITis not a little interesting to notice the many recommendatory nouns and adjectives which bear as their
    initial characters the letters composing the name of MOSES&amp; SON. For instance : the letter '&amp;M*at
    once reminds of (M)atchless (M)ake and (M)agnificent (M)aterial.-The               letter " 0 " is displayed in
    (0)ut-and-(0)ut (O)vercaats, (0)btainable (0)pposite the Church.-The               letter " S " is the initial
    character of the words (S)trength, S)martness, (S)tyle, and (S)uitability.-The           letter L 6 E "will be
    found in (E)ronomy, (E)uellence, [P)gnity, (E)xchange, and (S)o on.
       The A " in the conjunction whispers of (A)dmirable (A)rticies (A)dapted to ( ~ ) 1 1 . - ~ ~ ~ in     , " the
    same word, will show itself in (=)one so (N)oted as this (N)otorious (=)sine in trade.-The        letter "D lS
    calls to mind (D)urable (D)ress, (D)elicate ( ~ ) e s i g n ,and (D)ispatch.
       The word SON, it is true, furnishes us with the very same letters as we have just pointed out; but,
    notwithstanding, there will be no difficulty in finding new footsteps to tread in.
       A (S)lap-up (S)uit, for instance, at once gives us the letter "S " over again ;as do also the words
    (S)howrooms, (S)hawls, (S)carfs, (S)ilks, (S)atins, (S)hifts, and (S)o forth.-The             character "0,"
    again, speaks of (O)utfits, (O)xonians, and (0)ther similar article~.-~'W," in eouclusion, appears in
     (Nleatness, (N)icety, and (N)eglect in (W)othing, at the celebrated House of that Firm whose name
    has been thus truthfully analysed.

    resorted to in many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion withany
    other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 36, Fargate, Sheffield, and 19,
    Thornton's Buildings, Bradford, Yorkshire ; and those who desire genuine and cheap Clothing, &amp;c., should
    call at or send to Minories and Aldgate, City, London ; or to the Branch Establishments as above.

    resumed till 12 o'clock.

       BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NIUOLL), there is
     another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
     name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
     wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
     be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUlNEAS.




        .--
          The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                              Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
        T H E REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Spring Months, with all
     the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two
     GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,
     but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the
     intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,
     within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,
     with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be seen, ready for
     immediate wear, in every size, at the Patentees' Warerooms.

 T  HE peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
    FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest materials, quite equal to the best made in Paris.     Also,

  GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
   These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
         T H E EIDER D O W N QUILT,
also, is to be seen only at their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
 Qarriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                       BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, WITH PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable-
   OLD FEATHER-BEDS re-dressed by this process are perfectly freed from all
impurities ; and, by expanding the Feathers, the bulk is greatly increased, and the
Bed consequently rendered much fuller and softer, at 3d. per lb.
  OLD AND MOTHY MATTRESSES effectually cured and re-made.
  Every description of BLANKETS, QUILTS, and SHEETINGS.

 Of every description of Bedding, and is so arranged that purchasers are enabled to

frankness and manliness about him-he is the sworn           morality which pervades his writings, all combine to

                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.




                             CHAPTER IV.
                         I FALL INTO DISGRACE.

      IFthe room to which my bed was removed, were a sentient thing that
 could give evidence, I might appeal to it at this day-who sleeps there
 now, I wonder !-to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to
 it. I went up there, hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the
 way while I climbed the stairs ; and, looking as blank and strange upon the
 room as the room looked upon me, sat down with my small hands crossed,
 and thought.
     I thought of the oddest things. Of the shape of the room, of the cracks
 in the ceiling, of the paper on the wall, of the flaws in the window-glass
 making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of the washing-stand being
 ricketty on its three legs, and having a discontented something about it,
 which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge under the influence of the old one.
 I was crying all the time, but, except that I was conscious of being cold
 and dejected, I am sure I never thought why I cried. At last in my
 desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little
 Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to come here where no one
 seemed to want me, or to care about me, half as much as she did. This
 made such a very miserable piece of business of it, that I rolled myself up
in a corner of the counterpane, and cried myself to sleep.
     I was awoke by somebody saying " Here he is ! " and uncovering my
hot head. My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was
one of them who had done it.
     uDavy,'y said my mother. "What 's the matter? "
     I thought it very strange that she should ask me, and answered,
 " Nothing." I turned over on my face, I recollect, to hide my trembling
lip, which answered her with greater truth.
     "Davy," said my mother. "Davy, my child !"
     I dare say no words she could have uttered, would have affected me so
much, then, as her calling me her child. I hid my tears in the bedclothes,
and pressed her from me with my hand, when she would have raised
me up.
     "This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!" said my mother.
"1 have no doubt at all about it. How can you reconcile it to your
conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against
anybody who is dear to me? What do you mean by it, Peggotty ? "
    Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes, and only answered, in a
sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, "Lord
forgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and for what you have said this minute,
may you never be truly sorry !"
    '&lt; It 's enough to distract me," cried my mother. " In my honeymoon,
too, when my most inveterate enemy might relent, one would think, and
not envy me a little peace of mind and happiness. Davy, you naughty
boy ! Peggotty, you savage creature ! Oh, dear me !" cried my mother,
                                                              D

34            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

turning from one of us to the other, in her pettish wilful manner, "what
a troublesome world this is, when one has the most right to expect it to
be as agreeable as possible ! "
   I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither her's nor Peggotty's,
and slipped to my feet at the bed-side. I t was Mr. Murdstone's hand,
and he kept it on my arm as he said:
   "What's this ? Clara, my love, have you forgotten? -Firmness,
my dear !"
   "I am very sorry, Edward," said my mother. " I meant to be very
good, but I am so uncomfortable."
   " Indeed ! " he answered.     "That's a bad hearing, so soon, Clara."
   " I say it 's very hard I should be made so now," returned my mother,
pouting; " and it is-very hard-isn't i t ? "
   He drew her to him, whispered in her ear, and kissed her. I knew as
well, when I saw my mother's head lean down upon his shoulder, and her
arm touch his neck-I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature
into any form he chose, as I know, now, that he did it.
   " Go you below, my love," said Mr. Murdstone. "David and I will
come down, together. My friend," turning a darkening face on Peggotty,
when he had watched my mother out, and dismissed her with a nod and a
smile : " do you know your mistress's name ? "
   " She has been my mistress a long time, sir," answered Peggotty.        "I
ought to it."
   "That's true," he answered. "But I thought I heard you, as I came
up-stairs, address her by a name that is not hers. She has taken mine, you
know. Will you remember that ? "
   Peggotty, with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out of the
room without replying ; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected to go,
and had no excuse for remaining. When we two were left alone, he shut the
door, and sitting on a chair, and holding me standing before him, looked
steadily into my eyes. I felt my own attracted, no less steadily, to his.
As I recall our being opposed thus, face to face, I seem again to hear my
heart beat fast and high.
   "David," he said, making his lips thin, by pressing them together,
"if I have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with, what do you think
I do?"
   " I don't know."

   " I beat him."
   I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper, but I felt, in my silence,
that my breath was shorter now.
   " I make him wince, and smart.      I say to myself, ' I '11 conquer that
fellow; ' and if it were to cost him all the blood he had, I should do it.
What is that upon your face ? "
   "Dirt," I said.
   H e knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had asked
the question twenty times, each time with twenty blows, I believe my baby
heart would have burst before I would have told him so.
    " You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow," he said, with
 a grave smile that belonged to him, and you understood me very well, I
 see. Wash that face, sir, and come down with me "

    He pointed to the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like
Mrs. Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. I
had little doubt then, and I have less doubt now, that he would have
knocked me down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated.
    " Clara, my dear," he said, when I had done his bidding, and he walked
me into the parlor, with his hand still on my arm ; "you will not be made
uncomfortable any more, I hope. We shall soon improve our youthful
humours."
    God help me, I might have been improved for my whole life, I might
have been made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind word at that
season. A word of encouragement and explanation, of pity for my
childish ignorance, of welcome home, of reassurance to me that it was
home, might have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth, instead
of in my hypocritical outside, and might have made me respect instead of
hate him. I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the
room so scared and strange, and that, presently, when I stole to a chair,
she followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still-missing, perhaps,
some freedom in my childish tread-but the word was not spoken, and
the time for it was gone.
    We dined alone, we three together. He seemed to be very fond of
my mother-I am afraid I liked him none the better for that-and she
was very fond of him. I gathered from what they said, that an elder
sister of his was coming to stay with them, and that she was expected
that evening. I am not certain whether I found out then, or afterwards,
that, without being actively concerned in any business, he had some share
in, or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant's house in
London, with which his family had been connected from his great-grand-
father's time, and in which his sister had a similar interest; but I may
mention it in this place, whether or no.
    After dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating
an escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, lest
it should offend the master of the house, a coach drove up to the
garden-gate, and he went out to receive the visitor. My mother followed
him. I was timidly following her, when she turned round at the parlor-
door, in the dusk, and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to
do, whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him. She
did this hurriedly and secretly, as if it were wrong, but tenderly; and,
putting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came near to
where he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and drew
her's through his arm.
    I t was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady
she was ; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in face and
voice ; and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her large nose, as
if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers, she had
 carried them to that account. She brought with her, two uncompromising
 hard black boxes, with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails.
 When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel
 purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon
 her arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite. I had never, at that
 time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was.

36            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   She was brought into the parlor with many tokens of welcome, and
there formally recognised my mother as a new and near relation. Then
 she looked at me, and said :
    cc I s that your boy, sister-in-law ? "
   My mother acknowledged me.
    c c Generally speaking," said Miss Murdstone, '&lt; I don't like boys.
 How d' ye do, boy ? "
   Under these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very well,
 and that I hoped she was the same; with such an indifferent grace, that
 Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words :
    '' Wants manner !"
   Having uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the favor of
being shewn to her room, which became to me from that time forth a
place of awe and dread, wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or
known to be left unlocked, and where (for I peeped in once or twice when
she was out) numerous little steel fetters and rivets, with which Miss
Murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed, generally hung
upon the looking-glass in formidable array.
   As well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no
intention of ever going again. She began to " helpJ' my mother next
morning, and was in and out of the store-closet all day, putting things to
rights, and making havoc in the old arrangements. Almost the first
 remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was, her being constantly
 haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere
 on the premises. Under the influence of this delusion, she dived into the
 coal-cellar at the most untimely hours, and scarcely ever opened the door
 of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again, in the belief that she
 had got him.
    Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she was a
 perfect Lark in point of getting up. She was up (and, as I believe to this
 hour, looking for that man) before anybody in the house was stirring.
 Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one eye open ;
but I could not concur in this idea ; for I tried it myself after hearing the
 suggestion thrown out, and found it couldn't be done.
   On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her
bell at cock-crow. When my mother came down to breakfast and was
going to make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the
cheek, which was her nearest approach to a kiss, and said :
   " Now, Clara, my dear, I am come here, you know, to relieve you of all

the trouble I can. You're much too pretty and thoughtlessJJ-my mother
blushed but laughed, and seemed not to dislike this character-" to have
any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me. If you'll be
so good as give me your keys, my dear, 1'11 attend to all this sort of thing
in future."
   From that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all
day, and under her pillow all night, and my mother had no more to do
with them than I had.
   My mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a
shadow of protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing
certain household plans to her brother, of which he signified his approba-

 tion, my mother suddenly began to cry, and said she thought she might
 have been consulted.
     '&lt; Clara!" said Mr. Murdstone sternly.     " Clara ! I wonder at you."

      " Oh, it's very well to say you wonder, Edward !" cried my mother,
   and it's very well for you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn't like
it yourself."
    Firmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both Mr. and
Miss Murdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed my
 comprehension of it at that time, if I had been called upon, I nevertheless
 did clearly comprehend in my own way, that it was another name for
tyranny ; and for a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil's humour, that was in
them both. The creed, as I should state it now, was this. Mr. Murd-
stone was firm ; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr. Murdstone ;
nobody else in his world was to be firm at all, for everybody was to be
bent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone was an exception. She might be
firm, but only by relationship, and in an inferior and tributary degree. My
mother was another exception. She might be firm, and must be; but
 only in bearing their firmness, and firmly believing there was no other
firmness upon earth.
    " It's very hard," said my mother, "that in my own house-"

    "My own house?" repeated Mr. Murdstone. " Clara!"
    " Our own house, I mean," faltered my mother, evidently frightened
-" I hope you must know what I mean, Edward-it 's very hard that in
your own house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters.
I am sure I managed very well before we were married. There's evi-
dence," said my mother, sobbing ; " ask Peggotty if I didn't do very well
when I wasn't interfered with !"
    " Edward," said Miss Murdstone, " let there be an end of this. I go
to-morrow."
    " Jane Murdstone,"      said her brother, "be silent ! How dare you to
insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words imply ? "
    " I am sure," my poor mother went on, at a grievous disadvantage, and
with many tears, " I don't want anybody to go. I should be very
miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go. I don't ask much. I am
not unreasonable. I only want to be consulted sometimes. I am very
much obliged to anybody who assists me, and I only want to be consulted
as a mere form, sometimes. I thought you were pleased, once, with my
being a little inexperienced and girlish, Edward-I am sure you said so-
but you seem to hate me for it now, you are so severe."
    " Edward," said Miss Murdstone,-again,- - " let there be an end of this.
I go to-moGow."
    c c Jane Murdstone," thundered Mr. Murdstone.       "Will you be silent?
How dare you ? "
    Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief, and
held it before her eyes.
    " Clara," he continued, looking at my mother, " you surprise me ! You

 astound me ! Yes, I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying an
 inexperienced and artless person, and forming her character, and infusing
 into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it stood in
 need. But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance

              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition something
like a housekeeper's, and when she meets with a base return-"
   " Oh, pray, pray, Edward," cried my mother, " don't accuse me of being

ungrateful. I am sure I am not ungrateful. No one ever said I was,
before. I have many faults, but not that. Oh, don't, my dear !"
   "When Jane Murdstone meets, I say," he went on, after waiting until
my mother was silent, "with a base return, that feeling of mine is chilled
and altered."
   "Don't, my love, say that!" implored my mother, very piteously.
" Oh, don't, Edward ! I can't bear to hear it. Whatever I am, I am
affectionate. I know I am affectionate. I wouldn't say it, if I wasn't
certain that I am. Ask Peggotty. I am sure she '11 tell you I 'm &amp;ec-
tionate."
   "There is no extent of mere weakness, Clara," said Mr. Murdstone in
reply, "that can have the least weight with me. You lose breath."
   " Pray let us be friends," said my mother, " I couldn't live under
coldness or unkindness. I am so sorry. I have a great many defects, I
know, and it's very good of you, Edward, with your strength of mind, to
endeavour to correct them for me. Jane, I don't object to anything.
I should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving-"          My
mother was too much overcome to go on.
   " Jane Murdstone," said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, " any harsh words
between us are, I hope, uncommon. I t is not my fault that so unusual an
occurrence has taken place to-night. I was betrayed into it by another.
Nor is it your fault. You were betrayed into it by another. Let us
both try to forget it. And as this," he added, after these magnanimous
words, " is not a fit scene for the boy-David, go to bed ! "
   I could hardly find the door, through the tears that stood in my eyes.
I was so sorry for my mother's distress ; but I groped my way out, and
groped my way up to my room in the dark, without even having the
heart to say good night to Peggotty, or to get a candle from her. When
her coming up to look for me, an hour or so afterwards, awoke me,
 she said that my mother had gone to bedpoorly, and that Mr. and Miss
Murdstone were sitting alone.
   Going down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside
the parlor-door, on hearing my mother's voice. She was very earnestly
and humbly entreating Miss Murdstone's pardon, which that lady granted,
and a perfect reconciliation took place. I never knew my mother after-
wards to give an opinion on any matter, without first appealing to Miss
Murdstone, or without having first ascertained, by some sure means, what
Miss Murdstone's opinion was ; and I never saw Miss Murdstone, when out
of temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towards her bag as if
she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my
mother, without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright.
   The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the
Murdstone religion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought,
since, that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of
Mr. Murdstone's firmness, which wouldn't allow him to let any body off
from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse
for. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous visages with

which we used to go to church, and the changed air of the place. Again,
the dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file into the old pew first,
like a guarded captive brought to a condemned service. Again, Miss
Murdstone, in a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made
out of a pall, follows close upon me; then my mother; then her
 husband. There is no Peggotty now, as in the old time. Again, I listen
to Miss Murdstone mumbling the responses, and emphasising all the
 dread words with a cruel relish. Again, I see her dark eyes roll round the
church when she says "miserable sinners," as if she were calling all
the congregation names. Again, I catch rare glimpses of my mother,
moving her lips timidly between the two, with one of them muttering at
each ear like low thunder. Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether
it is likely that our good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and Miss
Murdstone right, and that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels.
Again, if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone
pokes me with her prayer-book, and makes my side ache.
   Yes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking at my
mother, and at me, and whispering. Again, as the three go on arm-in-arm,
and I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, and wonder if my
mother's step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the gaiety of
her beauty be really almost worried away. Again, I wonder whether any
of the neighbours call to mind, as I do, how we used to walk home
together, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that, all the dreary
dismal day.
   There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-
school. Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had
of course agreed with them. Nothing, however, was concluded on the
subject yet. I n the meantime, I learnt lessons at home.
   Shall I ever forget those lessons ! They were presided over nominally
by my mother, but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister, who were always
present, and found them a favourable occasion for giving my mother
lessons in that miscalled firmness, which was the bane of both our lives.
I believe I was kept at home, for that purpose. I had been apt enough to
learn, and willing enough, when my mother and I had lived alone together.
I can faintly remember learning the alphabet at her knee. To this day,
when I look upon the fat black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty
of their shapes, and the easy good-nature of 0 and Q and S, seem to
present themselves again before me as they used to do. But they recall no
feeling of disgust or reluctance. On the contrary, I seem to have walked
along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book, and to have been
cheered by the gentleness of my mother's voice and manner all the way.
But these solemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember as the death-
blow at my peace, and a grievous daily drudgery and misery. They were
very long, very numerous, very hard-perfectly unintelligible, some of
them, to me-and I was generally as much bewildered by them as I
believe my poor mother was herself.
   Let me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back
again.
   I come into the second-best parlor after breakfast, with my books,
and an exercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for me at her

40             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 writing-desk, but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair by the
 window (though he pretends to be reading a book), or as Miss Murdstone,
 sitting near my mother stringing steel beads. The very sight of these
 two has such an influence over me, that I begin to feel the words I have
 been at infinite pains to get into my head, all sliding away, and going I
 don't know where. I wonder where they do go, by-the-by ?
     I hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps it is a grammar, perhaps
 a history, or geography. I take a last drowning look at the page as I give
 it into her hand, and start off aloud at a racing pace while I have got it
 fresh. I trip over a word. Mr. Murdstone looks up. I trip over
 another word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden, tumble over half-a-
 dozen words, and stop. I think my mother would show me the book if
she dared, but she does not dare, and she says softly :
    " Oh, Davy, Davy! "

    " Now, Clara," says Mr. Murdstone, "be firm with the boy. Don't
say ' Oh, Davy, Davg !' That's childish. He knows his lesson, or he does
n i t know it.""
    " H e does not know it," Miss Murdstone interposes awfully.
    "I am really afraid he does not," says my mother.
    "Then you see, Clara," returns Miss Murdstone, "you should just
give him the book back, and make him know it."
    " Yes, certainly," says my mother ; " that is what I intend to do, my
dear Jane. Now, Davy, try once more, and don't be stupid."
    I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, but am
not so successful with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble down
before I get to the old place, at a point where I was all right before, and
 stop to think. But I can't think about the lesson. I think of the
number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's cap, or of the price of
Mr. Murdstone's dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem that I
have no business with, and don't want to have anything at all to do with.
Mr. Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been
expecting for a long time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My mother
glances submissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear
to be worked out when my other tasks are done.
    There is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling
snowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so
hopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that I
give up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The
despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other, as I blunder
on, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect in these miserable lessons
is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries to give me
the cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss Murdstone, who has
been lying in wait for nothing else all along, says in a deep warning voice :
    '' Clara ! "
    My mother starts, colors, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes
out of his chair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes my ears with
it, and turns me out of the room by the shoulders.
    Even when the lessons are done, the worst is yet to happen, in the shape
of an appalling sum. This is invented for me, and delivered to me
orally by Mr. Murdstone, and begins, " I f I go into a cheesemonger's

shop, and buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-
halfpenny each, present payment "-at          which I see Miss Murdstone
secretly overjoyed. I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlighten-
ment until dinner-time ; when, having made a Mulatto of myself by getting
the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin, I have a slice of bread to
help me out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace for the rest
of the evening.
    I t seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies
generally took this course. I could have done very well if I had been without
the Murdstones ;but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the
fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird. Even when I did get
through the morning with tolerable credit, there was not much gained but
dinner; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me untasked, and
if I rashly made any show of being unemployed, called her brother's
attention to me by saying, " Clara, my dear, there's nothing like work-
give your boy an exercise;" which caused me to be clapped down to some
new labor, there and then. As to any recreation with other children of
my age, I had very little of that; for the gloomy theology of the
Murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers (though
there was a child once set in the midst of the Disciples), and held that
they contaminated one another.
   The natural result of this treatment, continued, I suppose, for some six
months or more, was to make me sullen, dull, and dogged. I was not
made the less so, by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and
alienated from my mother. I believe I should have been almost stupified
but for one circumstance.
   I t was this. My father had left a small collection of books in a little room
up-stairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my own) and which nobody
else in our house ever troubled. From that blessed little room, Roderick
Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, The Vicar of
Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and RobinsonCrusoe, came out, a glorious
host, to keep me company. They kept alive my fancy, and my hope of some-
thing beyond that place and time,-they, and the Arabian Nights, and the
Tales of the Genii,-and did me no harm ; for whatever harm was in some
of them was not there for me ;I knew nothing of it. It is astonishing to
me now, how I found time, in the midst of my porings and blunderings
 over heavier themes, to read those books as I did. I t is curious to me
 how I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles (which
 were great troubles to me), by impersonating my favorite characters in
 them-as I did-and by putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone into all the bad
 ones-which I did too. I have been Tom Jones (a child's Tom Jones,
 a harmless creature) for a week together. I have sustained my own idea
 of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I verily believe. I had a
 greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and Travels-I forget what,
 now-that were on those shelves ; and for days and days I can remember
 to have gone about my region of our house, armed with the centre-piece
out of an old set of boot-trees-the perfect realisation of Captain Somebody,
 of the Royal British Navy, in danger of being beset by savages, and
resolved to sell his life at a great price. The Captain never lost dignity,
from having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar. I did ; but the

42            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 Captain was a Captain and a hero, in despite of all the grammars of all
 the languages in the world, dead or alive.
    This was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, the
 picture always rises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys at play in
 the churchyard, and I sitting onmy bed, reading as if for life. Every barn
in the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every foot of the
 churchyard, had some association of its own, in my mind, connected with
 these books, and stood for some locality made famous in them. I have
 seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple ; I have watched Strap,
with the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest himself upon the wicket-
gate; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club with
Mr. Pickle, in the parlor of our little village alehouse.
    The reader now understands as well as I do, what I was when I came
to that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again.
   One morning when I went into the parlor with my books, I found
my mother looking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr.
Murdstone binding something round the bottom of a cane-a lithe and
limber cane, which he left off binding when I came in, and poised and
switched in the air.
   " I tell you, Clara," said Mr. Murdstone, "I have been often flogged
myself."
   " To be sure ; of course," said Miss Murdstone.
    " Certainly, my dear Jane," faltered my mother, meekly. " But-but
do you think it did Edward good ?"
    "Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?" asked Mr. Murdstone,
gravely.
    "That's the point !" said his sister.
   T o this my mother returned, "Certainly, my dear Jane," and saidno more.
    I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue,
and sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine.
    "Now, David," he said-and I saw that cast again, as he saidit-" you
must be far more careful to-day than usual." H e gave the cane another
poise, and another switch; and having finished his preparation of it, laid it
down beside him, with an expressive look, and took up his book.
   This was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning. I
felt the words of my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or line by line,
but by the entire page. I tried to lay hold of them ;but they seemed, if I
may so express it, to have put skates on, and to skim away from me with a
smoothness there was no checking.
   We began badly, and went on worse. I had come in, with an idea of
distinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared ;
but it turned out to be quite a mistake. Book after book was added to
the heap of failures, Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the
time. And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses (canes he
made it that day, I remember), my mother burst out crying.
    " Clara ! " said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice.
    " I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think," said my mother.
   I saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he rose and said, taking up
the cane :
    "Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect firmness,

the worry and torment that David has occasioned her to-day. That
would be stoical. Clara is greatly strengthened and improved, but we
can hardly expect so much from her. David, you and I will go up-stairs,
boy."
   As he took me out at the door, my mother ran towards us. Miss
3Iurdstone said, " Clara ! are you a perfect fool ? " and interfered. I saw
my mother stop her ears then, and I heard her crying.
   H e walked me up to my room slowly and gravely-I am certain he
had a delight in that formal parade of executing justice-and when we
got there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.
   " Mr. Murdstone ! Sir !" I cried to him.     "Don't ! Pray don't beat
me ! I have tried to learn, sir, but I ean't learn while you and Miss
Murdstone are by. I ean't indeed ! "
   " Can't you, indeed, David?" he said. " We 1' 1 try that."
   H e had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and
stopped him for a moment, entreating him not to beat me. I t was only
for a moment that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant
afterwards, and in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held
me in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit it through. I t sets my teeth
on edge to think of it.
   He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death. Above all
the noise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying out-
I heard my mother crying out-and Peggotty. Then he was gone ; and
the door was locked outside ; and I was lying, fevered and hot, and torn,
and sore, and raging in my puny way, upon the floor.
   How well I recollect, when I became quiet, what an unnatural stillness
seemed to reign through the whole house ! How well I remember, when
my smart and passion began to cool, how wicked I began to feel !
   I sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. I crawled
up from the floor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and ugly,
that it almost frightened me. My stripes were sore and stiff, and made me
cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I felt. I t
lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal, I
dare say.
   I t had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (Ihad been lying,
for the most part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing,
and looking listlessly out), when the key was turned, and Miss Murdstone
came in with some bread and meat, and milk. These she put down upon
the table without a word, glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness,
and then retired, locking the door after her.
   Long after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else
would come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed,
and went to bed ; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully what would be
 done to me. Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed?
Whether I should be taken into custody, and sent to prison? Whether
I was at all in danger of being hanged?
   I never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and
fresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale
and dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared
before I was out of bed; told me, in so many words, that I was free to

44            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

walk in the garden for half an hour and no longer ; and retired, leaving
the door open, that I might avail myself of that permission.
    I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted
five days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone
 down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one,
Miss Murdstone excepted, during the whole time-except at evening
prayers in the parlor; to which I was escorted by Miss &amp;turdstone after
 everybody else was placed; where I was stationed, a young outlaw, all
 alone by myself near the door; and whence I was solemnly conducted by
my jailer, before anyone arose from the devotional posture. I only
 observed that my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept
her face another way so that I never saw it; and that Mr. $turdstone's
hand was bound up in a large linen wrapper.
    The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one.
They occupy the place of years in my remembrance. The way in which
I listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible
to me; the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the
murmuring of voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to any laughing,
whistling, or singing, outside, which seemed more dismal than anything
else to me in my solitude and disgrace-the uncertain pace of the hours,
especially at night, when I would wake thinking it was morning, and
find that the family were not yet gone to bed, and that all the length of
night had yet to come-the depressed dreams and nightmares I had-the
return of day, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the
churchyard, and I watched them from a distance within the room, being
ashamed to show myself at the window lest they should know I was a
prisoner-the       strange sensation of never hearing myself speak-the
fleeting intervals of something like cheerfulness, which came with eating
and drinking, and went away with it-the setting in of rain one evening,
with a fresh smell, and its coming down faster and faster between me
and the church, until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in
gloom, and fear, and remorse-all this appears to have gone round and
round for years instead of days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on
my remembrance.
    On the last night of my restraint, I was awakened by hearing my own
name spoken in a whisper. I started up in bed, and putting out my arms
in the dark, said :
    " I s that you, Peggotty ? "
   There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again,
in a tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone
into a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the
keyhole.
    I groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole,
whispered :
    " I s that you, Peggotty, dear?"
    "Yes, my own precious Davy," she replied. "Be as soft as a mouse,
or the Cat '11 hear us."
   I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the
urgency of the case ; her room being close by.
    " How's mama, dear Peggotty ?       Is she very angry with me? "

     I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, as I was
doing on mine, before she answered. "No. Not very."
     " What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear ?      Do you know ? "
     " School. Near London," was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to get
her to repeat it, for she spoke it the f i s t time quite down my throat, in
consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the key-
hole and put my ear there ; and though her words tickled me a good deal,
I didn't hear them.
     cr When, Peggotty ? "
      " TO-morrow."

     "Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my
drawers ?" which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention it.
     " Yes," said Peggotty. " Box."
     " Shan't I see mama ? "
     " Yes," said Peggotty. " Morning."
     Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole, and delivered these
words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has
ever been the medium of communicating, I will venture to assert : shoot-
ing in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own.
     " Davy, dear.   If I ain't ben azackly as intimate with you. Lately, as I
used to be. I t ain't becase I don't love you. Just as well and more, my
pretty poppet. It's because I thought it better for you. And for some one
else besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening ? Can you hear ? "
     " Ye-ye-ye-yes,       Peggotty !" I sobbed.
     " My own !" said Peggotty, with infinite compassion. " What I want
to say, is. That you must never forget me. For I 1' 1 never forget you. And
I 1' 1 take as much care of your mama, Davy. As ever I took of you. And I
won't leave her. The day may come when she '11 be glad to lay her poor
head. On her stupid, cross old Peggotty's arm again. And I'll write to
you, my dear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I 'll-I 'll-"            Peggotty
fell to kissing the keyhole, as she couldn't kiss me.
     "Thank you, dear Peggotty !" said I. &lt;' Oh, thank you ! Thank
you ! Will you promise me one thing, Peggotty ? Will you write and
tell Mr. Peggotty and little Em'ly and &amp;s. Gummidge and Ham, that
I am not so bad as they might suppose, and that I sent 'em all my love-
especially to little Em'ly ? Will you, if you please, Peggotty ?"
     The kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the
greatest affection-I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had been
her honest face-and parted. From that night there grew up in my
breast, a feeling for Peggotty, which I cannot very well define. She did
not replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into a
vacancy in my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards her some-
thing I have never felt for any other human being. I t was a sort of comical
affection too ; and yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should have
done, or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been
to me.
     I n the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was
going to school; which was not altogether such news to me as she
supposed. She also informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come
down-stairs into the parlor, and have my breakfast. There, I found my

mother, very pale and with red eyes : into whose arms I ran, and begged
her pardon from my suffering soul.
  c c Oh, Davy !" she said. " That you could hurt any one I love ! Try to
be better, pray to be better ! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, Davy,
that you should have such bad passions in your heart."
   They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was more
sorry for that, than for my going away. I felt it sorely. I tried to eat
my parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter,
and trickled into my tea. I saw my mother look at me sometimes,
and then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and then look down, or
look away.
   " Master Copperfield's box there !" said Miss Murdstone, when wheels

were heard at the gate.
   I looked for Peggotty, but it was not she ; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone
appeared. My former acquaintance, the carrier, was at the door; the
box was taken out to his cart, and lifted in.
   " Clara ! " said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note.

   "Ready, my dear Jane," returned my mother. " Good bye, Davy.
You are going for your own good. Good bye, my child. You will come
home in the holidays, and be a better boy."
   " Clara !" Miss Murdstone repeated.
   " Certainly, my dear Jane," replied my mother, who was holding me.

" I forgive you, my dear boy.     God bless you ! "
   " Clara ! " Miss Murdstone repeated.

   Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to
say on the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad
end; and then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it.




                             CHAPTER V.
                     I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME.
  WE might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was
quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short.
  Looking out to ascertain what for, I saw, to my amazement, Peggotty
burst from a hedge and climb into the cart. She took me in both her
arms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was
extremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I
found it very tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing
one of her arms, she put it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought
out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a
purse which she put into my hand, but not one word did she say. After
another and a final squeeze with both arms, she got down from the cart
and ran away; and, my belief is, and has always been, without a solitary
button on her gown. I picked up one, of several that were rolling about,
and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.
   The carrier looked at me, as if to enquire if she were coming back.

                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

I shook my head, and said I thought not. "Then come up," said the
carrier to the lazy horse ; who came up accordingly.
   Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think
it was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random,
nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I could
remember, in trying situations. The carrier, seeing me in this resolution,
proposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon the horse's
back to dry. I thanked him, and assented; and particularly small it
looked, under those circumstances.
   I had now leisure to examine the purse. I t was a stiff leather
purse, with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty
had evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight. But
its most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit of
paper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, "For Davy. With my
love." I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good
as reach me my pocket-handkerchief again ; but he said he thought I had
better do without it ; and I thought I really had ; so I wiped my eyes
on my sleeve and stopped myself.
   For good, too ; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was
still occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for
some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way.
   " All the way where ? " enquired the carrier.
   "There," I said.
   "Where 's there ? " enquired the carrier.
   " Near London ? " I said.
   "Why that horse," said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out,
"would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground."
   " Are you only going to Yarmouth then ? " I asked.

   " That's about it, " said the carrier. " And there I shall take you to
the stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that 1' 1 take you to-wherever it is. "
   As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis)
to say-he     being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic
temperament, and not at all conversational-I offered him a cake as a
mark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant, and
which made no more impression on his big face than it would have done
on an elephant's.
   " Did she make 'em, now ? " said Xlr. Barkis, always leaning forward,

in his slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each
knee.
   " Peggotty, do you mean, sir ? "
    " Ah ! " said Mr. Barkis.      Her. "
    " Yes.   She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking. "
    " Do she though? " said Mr. Barkis.
   H e made up his mouth as if to whistle, but he didn't whistle. H e sat
looking at the horse's ears, as if he saw something new there ;and sat so,
for a considerable time. By-and-by, he said :
   " NO sweethearts, I b'lieve ? "
   " Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis? " For I thought he wanted
something else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of
refreshment.

48             THE PERSONAL HISTORY ATID EXPERIENCE

  " Hearts, " said Mr.Barkis. " Sweet hearts; no person walks with her !"
  " With Peggotty ? "

  " Ah !" he said. " Her. "
  " Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart. "
  " Didn't she though ! " said Mr. Barkis.
    Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle,
but sat looking at the horse's ears.
     " So she makes," said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection,
" all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she ? "
    I replied that such was the fact.
    " Well.    I'll tell yon what, " said Mr. Barkis. " P'raps you might be
writin' to her ? "
    " I shall certainly write to her, " I rejoined.

    " Ah ! " he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. " Well ! If you
was writin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin' ;
would YOU. "
    " That Barkis is willing, " I repeated, innocently.     " I s that all the
message ? "
    " Ye-es, " he said, considering. " Ye-es.         Barkis is willin'. "
    cr But you will be at Blunderstone again to-morrow, Mr. Barkis, " I
said, faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, " and
could give your own message so much better. "
    As he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his head, and
once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound gravity,
c r Barkis is willin'.      That's the message," I readily undertook its
transmission. While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel at Yarmouth
that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paper and an inkstand, and
wrote a note to Peggotty which ran thus : " My dear Peggotty. I have
come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama. Yours aEec-
tionately. P. S. H e says he particularly wants you to know-Barkis is
willing. "
    When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis
relapsed into perfect silence ;and I, feeling quite worn out by all that had
happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I slept
soundly until we got to Yarmouth ;which was so entirely new and strange
to me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once abandoned a
latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty's family
there, perhaps even with little Enl'ly herself.
    The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without
any horses to i t as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more
unlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking this, and
wondering what would ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis
had put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up
the yard to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately become of me,
when a lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of
meat were hanging up, and said :
     " Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone? "
     "Yes, ma'am," I said.
     "What name ? " enquired the lady.
     " Copperfield, ma'am," I said.

    "That won't do," returned the lady. " Nobody's dinner is paid for
 here, in that name."
    " I s it Murdstone, ma'am 3 " I said.

    " If you're Master Murdstone," said the lady, "why do you go and

 give another name, first ? "
    I explained to the lady how it was, who then rang a bell, and called
 out, "William ! show the coffee-room ! " upon which a waiter came
running out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it,
and seemed a good deal surprised when he found he was only to show
it to me.
    I t was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I
 could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries,
 and I cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to
 sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the
 door; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set
of castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty.
    H e brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in
such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some
 offence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at
the table, and saying, very affably, " Now, six-foot ! come on ! "
    I thanked him, and took my seat at the board ; but found it extremely
difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity,
or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing
opposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful
manner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second
chop, he said :
    " There's half a pint of ale for you.  Will you have it now ? "
    I thanked him, and said "Yes." Upon which he poured it out of a jug into
a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, andmade it look beautiful.
    " My eye ! " he said. " I t seems a good deal, don't i t ? "
    " I t does seem a good deal," I answered with a smile.    For it was quite
delightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed, pimple-
faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and as he
stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with the
other hand, he looked quite friendly.
    " There was a gentleman here, yesterday," he said-"    a stout gentleman,
by the name of Topsawyer-perhaps you know him!"
    " No," I said, " I don't think-"
    " I n breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled
choaker," said the waiter.
    "No," I said bashfully, "I haven't the pleasure-"
    " He came in here," said the waiter, looking at the light through the

tumbler, " ordered a glass of this ale-would order it-I told him not-
drank it, and fell dead. I t was too old for him. I t oughtn't to be
drawn ; that 's the fact."
    I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said
I thought I had better have some water.
    "Why you see," said the waiter, still looking at the light through the
tumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, " our people don't like things being
ordered and left. I t offends 'em. But I ' l l drink it, if you like. I'm
                                                                 E

50             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

used to it, and use is everything. I don't think it '11 hurt me, if I throw
my head back, and take it off quick. Shall I ? "
   I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought he
could do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his
head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess, of seeing
him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall lifeless on the
carpet. But it didn't hurt him. On the contrary, I thought he seemed
the fresher for it.
   " What have we got here ? " he said, putting a fork into my dish. " Not
chops ? "
   " Chops," I said.

   "Lord bless my soul ! " he exclaimed, "I didn't know they were chops.
Why, a chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer !
Ain't it lucky 2 "
   So he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the other,
and ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction. H e
afterwards took another chop, and another potato ; and after that, another
chop and another potato. When we had done, he brought me a pudding,
and having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent i n
his mind for some moments.
   "How's the pie? " he said, rousing himself.
   " It's a pudding," I made answer.
   "Pudding ! " he exclaimed. " Why, bless me, so it is ! What ! "
looking at it nearer. "You don't mean to say i t 's a batter-pudding ! "
   'I Yes, it is indeed."

   "Why, a batter-pudding," he said, taking up a table-spoon, ''$ my
favorite pudding! Ain't that lucky ? Come on, little 'un, and let s see
who 'll get most."
   The waiter certainly got most. H e entreated me more than once to
 come in and win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his
dispatch to my dispatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I was left far
behind at the first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw
any one enjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was
all gone, as if his enjoyment of it lasted still.
   Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I
asked for the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty. He not only
brought it immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I
wrote the letter. When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going
to school.
   I said, "Near London," which was all I knew.
   " Oh, my eye !" he said, looking very low-spirited, " I am sorry for that."
   " Why ?" I asked him.
   " Oh, Lord ! " he said, shaking his head, " that's the school where they
broke the boy's ribs-two ribs-a little boy he was. I should say he
was-let me see-how old are you, about?"
   I told him between eight and nine.
   " That's just his age," he said. " H e was eight years and six months
old when they broke his first rib ; eight years and eight months old when
they broke his second, and did for him."
   I could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this was an

uncomfortable coincidence, and enquired how it was done. His answer was
not cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, "With
whopping."
   The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion,
which made me get up and hesitatingly enquire, in the mingled pride and
diffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there
were anything to pay.
   "There's a sheet of letter-paper," he returned. " Did you ever buy a
sheet of letter-paper ? "
   I could not remember that I ever had.
   "It 'S dear," he said, " on account of the duty. Threepence. That's
the way we're taxed in this country. There's nothing else, except the
waiter. Never mind the ink. I l o s e by that.''
   .'What should you-what should I-how much ought I to-what
would i t be right to pay the waiter, if you please? " I stammered, blushing.
   "If I hadn't a family, and that family hadn't the cowpock," said the
waiter, "I wouldn't take a sixpence. If I didn't support a aged pairint,
and a lovely sister,"-here the waiter was greatly agitated-" I wouldn't
take a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated well here, I should
beg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking of it. But I live on broken
wittles-and I sleep on the coals "-here the waiter burst into tears.
   I was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that any recog-
nition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart.
Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he received
with much humility and veneration, and spun up with his thumb, directly
afterwards, to try the goodness of.
   I t was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up
behind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without
any assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in the bow-
window, say to the guard, "Take care of that child, George, or he 1' 1
burst ! " and from observing that the women-servants who were about the
place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon. My
unfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite recovered his spirits, did not
appear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admiration
without being at all confused. If I had any doubt of him, I suppose this
half-awakened it ; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple con-
fidence of a child, and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years
(qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for
worldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole,
even then.
   I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it, the
subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing
heavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and as to the greater expe-
diency of my travelling by waggon. The story of my supposed appetite
getting wind among the outside passengers, they were merry upon it
likewise ;and asked me whether I was going to be paid for, at school, as two
brothers or three, and whether I was contracted for, or went upon the
regular terms; with other pleasant questions. But the worst of it
was, that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything, when an oppor-
tunity offered, and that, after a rather light dinner, I should remain hungry

.J   2        THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

all night-for I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My
apprehensions were realised. When we stopped for supper I couldn't
muster courage to take any, though I should have liked it very much, but
sat by the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did not save me
from more jokes, either ; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face,
who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way, except
when he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I was like a boa
constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time ; after
which, he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef.
    We had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, and
we were due in London about eight next morning. I t was Midsummer
weather, and the evening was very pleasant. When we passed through a
village, I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like, and
what the inhabitants were about; and when boys came running after us,
and got up behind and swung there for a little way, I wondered whether
their fathers were alive, and whether they were happy at home. I had plenty
to think of, therefore, besides my mind running continually on the kind of
place I was going to-which was an awful speculation. Sometimes,I remem-
ber, I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty ; and to endeavour-
ing, in a confused blind way, to recall how I had felt, and what sort of boy
I used to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone : which I couldn't satisfy myself
about by any means, I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity.
    The night was not so pleasant as the evening, for it got chilly; and
being put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) to
 prevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by their
 falling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard
 sometimes, that I could not help crying out, " Oh ! If you please ! "
 -which they didn't like at all, because it woke them. Opposite me was
 an elderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked in the dark more like a
 haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady
 had a basket with her, and she hadn't known what to do with it, for a
 long time, until she found that on account of my legs being short, it could
 go underneath me. I t cramped and hurt me so, that it made me per-
 fectly miserable ; but if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was
 in the basket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave
 me the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, '&lt; Come, don't you fidget.
 Yow bones are young enough, I ' m sure! "
    At last the sun rose, and then my companions seemed to sleep easier.
 The difficulties under which they had laboured all night, and which had
 found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts, are not to be con-
 ceived. As the sun got higher, their sleep became lighter, and so they
 gradually one by one awoke. I recollect being very much surprised by
 the feint everybody made, then, of not having been to sleep at all, and by
 the uncommon indignation with which every one repelled the charge. I
 labor under the same kind of astonishment to this day, having invariably
 observed that of all human weaknesses, the one to which our common
 nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine why) is the
 weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach.
    What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance,
 and how I believed all the adventures of all my favorite heroes to be
  constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it out

in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities
of the earth, I need not stop here to relate. We approached it by degrees,
and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district, for which we
were bound. I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or the Blue Boar ;
but I know it was the Blue Something, and that its likeness was painted
up on the back of the coach.
   The guard's eye lighted on me as he was getting down, and he said at
the booking-office door :
    " I s there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of &amp; h d -

stone, from BIoonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called for ?"
   Nobody answered.
    " Try Copperfield, if you please, sir," said I, looking helplessly down.

    " I s there anybody here for a yoongster, booked in the name of Murd-
stone,from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name of Copperfield,
to be left till called for ?" said the guard. " Come ! 1s there anybody?"
   No. There was nobody. I looked anxiously around; but the enquiry
made no impression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in gaiters,
with one eye, who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round
my neck, and tie me up in the stable.
   A ladder was brought, and I got down after the lady, who was like a
haystack : fiot daring to stir, until her basket was removed. The coach
was clear of passengers by that time, the luggage was very soon cleared
out, the horses had been taken out before the luggage, and now the coach
itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out of the way. Still,
nobody appeared, to claim the dusty youngster fromBlunderstone, Suffolk.
   More solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had nobody to look at him
and see that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, and, by invita-
tion of the clerk on duty, passed behind the counter, and sat down on the
scale at which they weighed the luggage. Here, as I sat looking at the
parcels, packages, and books, and inhaling the smell of stables (ever since
associated with that morning), a procession of most tremendous considera-
tions began to march through my mind. Supposing nobody should ever
fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there? Would they
keep me long enough to spend seven shillings ? Should I sleep at night
in one of those wooden binns with the other luggage, and wash myself at
the pump in the yard in the morning; or should I be turned out every
night, and expected to come again to be left till called for, when the office
opened next day ? Supposing there was no mistake in the case, and Mr.
Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me, what should I do ? If
they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings were spent, I
couldn't hope to remain there when I began to starve. That would obviously
be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, besides entailing on the
Blue Whatever-it-was, the risk of funeral expenses. If I started off at
once, and tried to walk back home, how could I ever find my way, how
could I ever hope to walk so far, how could I make sure of any one but
Peggotty, even if I got back ? If I found out the nearest proper authori-
ties, and offered myself to go for a soldier, or a sailor, I was such a little
fellow that it was most likely they wouldn't take me in. These thoughts,
and a hundred other such thoughts, turned me burning hot, and made me
giddy with apprehension and dismay. I was in the height of my fever

54             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 when a man entered and whispered to the clerk, who presently slanted me
 off the scale, and pushed me over to him, as if I were weighed, bought,
 delivered, and paid for.
    As I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance,
 I stole a look at him. He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow
 cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr, Mnrdstone's; but there the
 likeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, instead of
 being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressed in a suit of black clothes
 which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short in the sleeves and
 legs ; and he had a white neck-kerchief on that was not over-clean. I did
 not, and do not, suppose that this neck-kerchief was all the linen he wore,
 but it was all he showed or gave any hint of.
    " You 're the new boy ? " he said.

    " Yes, sir," I said.
    I supposed I was. I didn't know.
    "I 'm one of the masters at Salem House," he said.
    I made him a bow and felt very much overawed. I was so ashamed to
allude to a common-place thing like my box, to a scholar and a master at
Salem House, that we had gone some little distance from the yard before
I had the hardihood to mention it. We turned back, on my humbly
insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter ; and he told the clerk
that the carrier had instructions to call for it at noon.
    " If you please, sir," I said, when we had accomplished about the same
distance as before, " is it far ? "
    " It's down by Blackheath," he said.
    "Is that far, sir ? " I diffidently asked.
    "It's a good step," he said. "We shall go by the stage-coach. I t ' s
about six miles."
    I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles more,
was too much for me. I took heart to tell him that I had had nothing all
night, and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat, I should be
very much obliged to him. He appeared surprised at this-I see him stop
and look at me now-and after considering for a few moments, said he
wanted to call on an old person who lived not far 08,and that the best
way would be for me to buy some bread, or whatever I liked best that was
.rvholesome, and make my breakfast at her house, where we could get
some milk.
    Accordingly ure looked in at a baker's window, and after I had made a
series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and lie
had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of
brown bread, which cost me threepence. Then, at a grocer's shop, we
bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon ; which still left what I thought
a good deal of change, out of the second of the bright shillings, and made
me consider London a very cheap place. These provisions laid in, we went
on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond
description, and over a bridge which, no doubt, was London Bridge
(indeed I think he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to the
poor person's house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew by
their look, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate, which said they
were established for twenty-five poor women.

   The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little
black doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned
window on one side, and another little diamond-paned window above ;
and we went into the little house of one of these poor old women, who was
blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil. On seeing the master enter, the
old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee, and said something that
I thought sounded like "My Charley ! " but on seeing me come in too,
she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey.
   " Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you please? "
said the Master at Salem House.
   " Can I ?" said the old woman. " Yes can I , sure !"
   " How's Mrs. Fibbitson to-day ?" said the Master, looldng at another
old woman in a large chair by the fire, who was such a bundle of clothes
that I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake.
   " Ah, she's poorly,"      said the first old woman. " I t 's one of her
bad days. If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe
she 'd go out too, and never come to life again."
   As they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was a warm
day, she seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied she was jealous
even of the saucepan on it ; and I have reason to know that she took its
impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in
dudgeon; for I saw her, withmy own discomfited eyes, shake her fist at me
once, when those culinary operations were going on, and no one else was
looking. The sun streamed in at the little window, but she sat with her
own back and the back of the large chair towards it, screening the fire as if
she were sedulously keeping it warm, instead of it keeping her warm, and
watching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion of the prepara-
tions for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her such extreme joy that
she laughed aloud-and a very unmelodious laugh she had, I must say.
   I sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, with a
bason of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal. While I was yet
in the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house said to the Master :
   " Have you got your flute with you?"
   " Yes," he returned.
   " Have a blow at it," said the old woman, coaxingly. "Do !"
   The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat,
and brought out his flute in three pieces, which he screwed together, and
began immediately to play. My impression is, after many years of con-
sideration, that there never can have been anybody in the worId who
played worse. H e made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard pro-
duced by any means, natural or artificial. I don't know what the tunes
were-if there were such things in the performance at all, which I doubt
-but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make me think of
all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back; then to take
away my appetite; and lastly to make me so sleepy that I couldn't keep
my eyes open. They begin to close again, and I begin to nod, as the
recollection rises fresh upon me. Once more the little room with its
open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and its angular little
staircase leading to the room above, and its three peacock's feathers dis-
played over the mantelpiece-I remember wondering when I first went in,

56            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery
was doonied to come to-fades from before me, and I nod, and sleep.
The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard instead,
and I am on my journey. The coach jolts, I wake with a start, and the
flute has come back again, and the Master at Salem House is sitting with
his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old woman of the house
looks on delighted. She fades in her turn, and he fades, and all fades,
and there is no flute, no Master, no Salem House, no David Copperfield,
no anything but heavy sleep.
   I dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal
flute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him
in her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of his chair and gave him
an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing for a
moment. I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking, either
then or immediately afterwards ; for, as he resumed-it was a real fact
that he had stopped playing-I saw and heard the same old woman ask
Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs.
Fibbitson replied, '&lt; Ay, ay ! Yes ! " and nodded at the fire : to which, I
am persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.
   When I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at Salem
House unscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them up as before,
and took me away. We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon
the roof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to
take up somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers,
and where I slept profoundly, until I found the coach going at a footpace
up a steep hill among green leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come
to its destination.
   A short walk brought us-I mean the Master and me-to Salem House,
which was enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very dull. Over a
door in this wall was a board with SALEMHOUSEupon it ; and through
a grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a
surly face, which I found, on the door being opened, belonged to a stout
man with a bull-neck, a wooden leg, overhanging temples, and his hair cut
close all round his head.
   " The new boy," said the Master.
   The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over-it didn't take long,
for there was not much of me-and locked the gate behind us, and took
out the key. We were going up to the house, among some dark heavy
trees, when he called after my conductor.
   " Hall0 ! "
   We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where
he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.
   " Here ! The cobbler's been," he said, " since you 've been out,
Mr. Mell, and he says he can't mend 'em any more. H e says there an't
a bit of the original boot left, and he wonders you expect it."
   With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went back
a few paces to pick them up, and looked at them (very disconsolately,
I was afraid), as we went on together. I observed then, for the first
time, that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear, and
that his stocking was just breaking out in one place, like a bud.

                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            57
    Salem House was a square brick building with wings ; of a bare and
unfurnished appearance. All about it was so very quiet, that I said to
Mr. Mell I supposed the boys were out ; but he seemed surprised at my not
knowing that it was holiday-time. That all the boys were at their several
homes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down by the sea-side with
Mrs. and Miss Creakle ; and that I was sent in holiday-time as a punish-
ment for my misdoing, all of which he explained to me as we went along.
   I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most
forlorn and desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long room
with three long rows of desks, and six of forms, and bristling all round
with pegs for hats and slates. Scraps of old copybooks and exercises,
litter the dirty floor. Some silkworms' houses, made of the same materials,
are scattered over the desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind
by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of paste-
board and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything
to eat. A bird, in a cage a very little bigger than himself, makes a mournful
rattle now and then in hopping on his perch, two inches high, or dropping
from it ; but neither sings nor chirps. There is a strange unwholesome
smell upon the room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet apples wanting air,
and rotten books. There could not well be more ink splashed about it, if
it had been roofless from its first construction, and the skies had rained,
snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year.
   Mr. Me11 having left me while he took his irreparable boots up-stairs, I
went softly to the upper end of the room, observing all this as I crept
along. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written,
which was lying on the desk, and bore these words-" Take care of him.
H e bites."
   I got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great dog
underneath. But, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, I could
see nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering about, when Mr. Mell
came back, and asked me what I did up there.
   " I beg your pardon, sir," says I, &lt;'   if you please, I 'm looking for the
dog."
   " Dog,? " says he. " What dog ? "
   " Isn t it a dog, sir ? "
   " Isn 't what a dog ? "
   " That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites."
   " No, Copperfield," says he gravely, " that's not a dog. That 's a boy.
My instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back. I am
sorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must do it."
   With that, he took me down, and tied the placard, which was neatly
constructed for the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; and
wherever I went, afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying it.
   What I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine. Whether
it was possible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that
somebody was reading it. I t was no relief to turn round and find
nobody; for wherever my back was, there I imagined somebody always
to be. That cruel man with the wooden leg, aggravated my sufferings.
H e was in authority; and if he ever saw me leaning against a tree,
or a wall, or the house, he roared out from his lodge-door in a

               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

stupendous voice, "Hallo, you sir ! You Copperfield! Show that
badge conspicuous, or I'll report you!"              The playground was a
bare gravelled yard, open to all the back of the house and the offices;
and I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher read it, and
the baker read i t ; that everybody, in a word, who came backwards
and forwaxds to the house, of a morning when I was ordered to walk
there, read that I was to be taken care of, for I bit. I recollect that I posi-
tively began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy who did bite.
   There was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had
a custom of carving their names. I t was completely covered with
such inscriptions. I n my dread of the end of the vacation and
their coming back, I could not read a boy's name, without enquiring
in what tone and with what emphasis he would read, "Take care
of him. H e bites." There was one boy-a               certain J. Steerforth-
who cut his name very deep and very often, who, I conceived, would
read it in a rather strong voice, and afterwards pull my hair. There
was another boy, one Tommy Traddles, who I dreaded would make game
of it, and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me. There was a third,
George Demple, who I fancied would sing it. I have looked, a little
shrinking creature, at that door, until the owners of all the names-there
were five-and-forty of them in the school then, Mr. Me11 said-seemed to
send me to Coventry by general acclamation, and to cry out, each in his
own way, '&lt; Take care of him. He bites ! "
   I t was the same with the places at the desks and forms. I t was the
same with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my way to,
and when I was in, my own bed. I remember dreaming night after night,
of being with my mother as she used to be, or of going to a party at
Mr. Peggotty's, or of travelling outside the stage-coach, or of dining again
with my unfortunate friend the waiter, and in all these circumstances
making people scream and stare, by the unhappy disclosure that I had
nothing on but my little night-shirt, and that placard.
   I n the monotony of my life, and in my constant apprehension of the
reopening of the school, it was such an insupportable affliction ! I had
long tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, there being no
Mr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them without disgrace.
Before, and after them, I walked about-supervised, as I have mentioned,
by the man with the woodenleg. How vividly I call to mind the damp
about the house, the green cracked flagstones in the court, an old leaky
water-butt, and the discolored trunks of some of the grim trees, which
seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees, and to
have blown less in the sun ! At one we dined, Mr. Me11 and I, at the
upper end of a long bare dining-room, full of deal tables, and smelling of
fat. Then, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Me11 drank out
of a blue teacup, and I out of a tin pot. All day long, and until seven
or eight in the evening, Mr. Mell, at his own detached desk in the
schoolroom, worked hard with pen, ink, ruler, books, and writing-paper,
making out the bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put
up his things for the night he took out his flute, and blew at it,
until I almost thought he would gradually blow his whole being into
the large hole at the top, and ooze away at the keys.

                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    I picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting with my
head upon my hand, listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and
conning to-morrow's lessons. I picture myself with my books shut up,
still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening through
i t to what used to be at home, and to the blowing of the wind on
Yarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary. I picture myself
going u p to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side
crying for a comfortable word from Peggotty. I picture myself coming
down stairs in the morning, and looking through a long ghastly gash
of a staircase-window, at the school-bell hanging on the top of an
outhouse, with a weathercock above it ; and dreading the time when it
shall ring J. Steerforth and the rest to work : which is only second, in my
foreboding apprehensions, to the time when the man with the wooden leg
shall unlock the rusty gate to give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle.
I cannot think I was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects,
but in all of them I carried the same warning on my back.
    Mr. Me11 never said much to me, but he was never harsh to me. I
suppose we were company to each other, without talking. I forgot to
mention that he would talk to himself sometimes, and grin, and clench his
fist, and grind his teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner.
But he had these peculiarities : and at first they frightened me, though I
soon got used to them.




                             CHAPTER TI.
              I ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE.

   I HAD led this life about a month, when the man with the wooden leg
began to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water, from which I
inferred that preparations were making to receive Mr. Creakle and the
boys. I was not mistaken; for the mop came into the schoolroom before
long, and turned out Mr. Me11 and me, who lived where we could, and
got on how we could, for some days, during which we were always in
the way of two or three young women, who had rarely shown themselves
before, and were so continually in the midst of dust that I sneezed almost
as much as if Salem House had been a great snuff-box.
   One day I was informed by Mr. Mell, that Mr. Creakle would be home
that evening. I n the evening, after tea, I heard that he was come. Before
bed-time, I was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear
before him.
   Mr. Creakle's part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than
ours, and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant after the dusty
playground, which was such a desert in miniature, that I thought no one
but a camel, or a dromedary, could have felt at home in it. I t seemed to
me a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked comfortable,
as I went on my way, trembling, to Mr. Creakle's presence : which so

60            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERLENCE

abashed me, when I was ushered into it, that I hardly saw Mrs. Creakle
or Miss Creakle (who were both there, in the parlor), or anything but
Mr. Creakle, a stout gentleman with a bunch of watch-chain and seals, in
an arm-chair, with a tumbler and bottle beside him.
   "So ! " said Mr. Creakle. " This is the young gentleman whose teeth
are to be filed ! Turn him round."
   The wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard ;
and haying afforded time for a full survey of it, turned me about again,
with my face to Mr. Creakle, and posted himself at Mr. Creakle's side.
Mr. Creakle's face was fiery, and his eyes were small, and deep in his
head; he had thick veins in his forehead, a little nose, and a large chin.
H e was bald on the top of his head ; and had some thin wet-looking hair
that was just turning grey, brushed across each temple, so that the two
sides interlaced on his forehead. But the circumstance about him which
impressed me most, was, that he had no voice, but spoke in a whisper.
The exertion this cost him, or the consciousness of talking in that feeble
way, made his angry face so much more angry, and his thick veins so
much thicker, when he spoke, that I am not surprised, on looking back,
at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one.
   " Now, " said Mr. Creakle. " What's the report of this boy ? "
   " There's nothing against him yet, " returned the man with the wooden

leg. " There has been no opportunity. "
   I thought Mr. Creakle was disappointed. I thought Mrs. and Miss
Creakle (at whom I now glanced for the first time, and who were, both,
thin and quiet) were not disappointed.
   " Come here, sir ! " said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me.

   " Come here ! " said the man with the wooden leg, repeating the
gesture.
   "I have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law," whispered
Mr. Creakle, taking me by the ear; " and a worthy man he is, and a
man of a strong character. He knows me, and I know him. Do you
know me ? Hey ? " said Mr. Creakle, pinching my ear with ferocious
playfulness.
   "Not yet, sir," I said, flinching with the pain.
   "Not yet ? Hey? " repeated Mr. Creakle. "But you will soon. Hey ? "
   " You will soon.     Hey ? " repeated the man with the wooden leg. I
afterwards found that he generally acted, with his strong voice, as
Mr. Creakle's interpreter to the boys.
   I was very much frightened, and said, I hoped so, if he pleased. I felt,
all this while, as if my ear were blazing ; he pinched it so hard.
   " I'll tell you what I am," whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it go at last,
with a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes. "I 'm a
Tartar."
   " A Tartar," said the man with the wooden leg.
   " When I say I'll do a thing, I do it," said Mr. Creakle ; '&lt; and when
I say I will have a thing done, I will have it done."
   "-Will have a thing done, I will have it done," repeated the man
with the wooden leg.
   " I am a determined character," said Mr. Creakle. " That 's what I
 am. I do my duty. That's what I do My flesh and blood "-he

looked at Mrs. Creakle as he said this-" when it rises against me, is not
my flesh and blood. I discard it. Has that fellow," to the man with
the wooden leg, " been here again ? "
    " No," was the answer.
   " No," said Mr. Creakle. " H e knows better. He knows me. Let
him keep away. I say let him keep away," said Mr. Creakle, striking his
hand upon the table, and looking at Mrs. Creakle, "for he knows me.
Now you have begun to know me too, my young friend, and you may go.
Take him away."
   I was very glad to be ordered away, for Mrs. and Miss Creakle were
both wiping their eyes, and I felt as uncomfortable for them, as I did
for myself. But I had a petition on my mind which concerned me so
nearly, that I couldn 't help saying, though I wondered at my own courage :
   " If you please, sir-"
   Mr. Creakle whispered, " Hah ? What's this ? " and bent his eyes
upon me, as if he would have burnt me up with them.
   " If you please, sir," I faltered, "if I might be allowed (I am very

sorry indeed, sir, for what I did) to take this writing off, before the boys
come back-"
   Whether Mr Creakle was in earnest, or whether he only did it to
frighten me I don't know, but he made a burst out of his chair, before
which I precipitately retreated, without waiting for the escort of the
man with the wooden leg, and never once stopped until I reached
my own bedroom, where, finding I was not pursued, I went to bed, as
it was time, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours.
   Next morning Mr. Sharp came back. Mr. Sharp was the first master,
and superior to Mr. Mell. Mr. Me11 took his meals with the boys, hut
Mr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle's table. He was a limp,
delicate-looking gentleman, I thought, with a good deal of nose, and a way
of carrying his head on one side, as if it were a little too heavy for
him. His hair was very smooth and wavy; but I was informed by the
very first boy who came back that it was a wig (a second-hand one he
said), and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it
curled.
   I t was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of
intelligence. He was the first boy who returned. He introduced himself
by informing me that I should find his name on the right-hand corner of
the gate, over the top bolt ; upon that I said, " Traddles ? " to which
he replied, "The same," and then he asked me for a full account of myself
and &amp;mily.
   I t was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. H e
enjoyed my placard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment of
either disclosure or concealment, by presenting me to every other boy who
came back, great or smal1,immediatelyon his arriva1,in this form of introduc-
tion, "Look here ! Here's a game ! " Happily, too, the greater part of the
boys came back low-spirited, and were not so boisterous at my expense as
I had expected. Some of them certainly did dance about me like wild
Indians, and the greater part could not resist the temptation of pretending
that I was a dog, and patting and smoothing me lest I should bite, and
saying, "Lie down, sir !" and calling me Towzer. This was naturally

62            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

confusing, among so many strangers, and cost me some tears, but on the
whole it was much better than I had anticipated.
   I was not considered as being formally received into the school, however,
until J. Steerforth arrived. Before this boy, who was reputed to be a
great scholar, and was very good-looking, and at least half-a-dozen years
my senior, I was carried as before a magistrate. H e enquired, under a shed
in the playground, into the particulars of my punishment, and was pleased
to express his opinion that it was " a jolly shame ;" for which I became
bound to him ever afterwards.
   "What money have you got, Copperfield? " he said, walking aside with
me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms.
   I told him seven shillings.
   " You had better give it to me to take care of," he said. "At least,
you can if you like. You needn't if you don't like."
   I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and open in^
Peggotty's purse, turned it upside down into his hand.
   " Do you want to spend anything now? " he asked me.

   " No, thank you," I replied.
   " You can if you like, you know," said Steerforth. " Say the word."
   "No, thank you, sir," I repeated.
   " Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of
currant wine by-and-by, up in the bedroom? " said Steerforth. " You
belong to my bedroom, I find."
   It certainly had not occurred to me before, but I said, Yes, I should
like that.
   "Very good," said Steerforth. " You'll be glad to spend another
shilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say? "
   1 said, Yes, I should like that, too.
   " And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh? "

said Steerforth. " I say, young Copperfield, you 're going it ! "
   I smiled because he smiled, but I was a little troubled in my mind, too.
   " Well ! " said Steerforth.   " We must make it stretch as far as we
can; that's all. I 'll do the best in my power for you. I can go out
when I like, and I'll smuggle the prog in." With these words he put the
money in his pocket, and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy; he
would take care it should be all right.
   H e was as good as his word, if that were all right which I had a secret
misgiving was nearly all wrong-for I feared it was a waste of my mother's
two half-crowns-though      I had preserved the piece of paper they were
wrapped in: which was a precious saving. When we went up-stairs
to bed, he produced the whole seven shillings' worth, and laid it out on
my bed in the moonlight, saying :
   "There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal spread you 'ye got ! "
   I couldn't think of doing the honors of the feast, at my time of life,
while he was by; my hand shook at the very thought of it. I begged
him to do me the favor of presiding; and my request being seconded by
the other boys who were in that room, he acceded to it, and sat upon my
pillow, handing round the viands-with perfect fairness, I must say-and
dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was his
 own property. As to me, I sat on his left hand, and the rest were grouped
 about us, on the nearest beds and on the floor.

    How .well I recollect our sitting there, talking in whispers ; or their
talking, and my respectfully listening, I ought rather to say; the moon-
light falling a little way into the room, through the window, painting a
pale window on the floor, and the greater part of us in shadow, except
when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorous-box, when he wanted
to look for anything on the board, and shed a blue glare over us that was
gone directly ! A certain mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness,
the secresy of the revel, and the whisper in which everything was said,
steals over me again, and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling
of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that they are all so near, and
frightens me (though I feign to laugh) when Traddles pretends to see
a ghost in the corner.
    I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it. I
heard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar
without reason; that he was the-sternest and most severe of masters;
that he laid about him, right and left, every day of his life, charging in
among the boys like a trooper, and slashing away, unmercifully. That he
knew nothing himself, but the art of slashing, being more ignorant (J.
 Steerforth said) than the lowest boy in the school; that he had been,
a good many years ago, a small hop-dealer in the Borough, and had taken
to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops, and making away
with Mrs. Creakle's money. With a good deal more of that sort, which
I wondered how they knew.
    I heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay,
was an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business,
but had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence,
as was supposed among the boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr.
Creakle's service, and having done a deal of dishonest work for him, and
knowing his secrets. I heard that with the single exception of Mr.
 Creakle, Tungay considered the whole establishment, masters and boys,
as his natural enemies, and that the only delight of his life was to be sour
and malicious. I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son, who had not been
Tungay's friend, and who, assisting in the school, had once held some
remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very
cruelly exercised, and was supposed, besides, to have protested against
his father's usage of his mother. I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned
him out of doors, in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had
been in a sad way, ever since.
    But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being
 one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that
boy being J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was
 stated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it. On being
 asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed if he did begin to see
 him do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorous-box on purpose to sheda
glare over his reply, and said he would commence by knocking him down
with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that was
always on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark for some time, breathless.
    I heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Me11 were both supposed to be
wretchedly paid; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at
Mr. Creakle's table, Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred

cold; which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the only parlor-
boarder. I heard that Mr. Sharp's wig didn't fit him; and that he
needn't be so " bounceable"-somebody else said " bumptious "-about it,
because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind.
   I heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant's son, came as a set-off
against the coal-bill, and was called on that account "Exchange or
Barter "-a      name selected from the arithmetic-book as expressing this
arrangement. I heard that the table-beer was a robbery of parents, and
the pudding an imposition. I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the
school in general as being in love with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I sat
in the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine face, and his easy
manner, and his curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard that
Mr. Me11 was not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to bless
himself with ; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his mother,
was as poor as Job. I thought of my breakfast then, and what had
sounded like "My Charley ! " but I was, I am glad to remember, as mute
as a mouse about it.
   The hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the banquet
some time. The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as
the eating and drinking were over; and we, who had remained whisper-
ing and listening half undressed, at last betook ourselves to bed, too.
   " Good night, young Copperfield," said Steerforth, "I'll take care
of you."
   "You 're very kind," I gratefully returned. " I am very much obliged
to you."
   "You haven't got a sister, have you? " said Steerforth, yawning.
   " NO," I answered.
   " That's a pity," said Steerforth. "If you had had one, I should
think she would have been a pretty, timid, little, bright-eyed sort of girl.
I should have liked to know her. Good night, young Copperfield."
   " Good night, sir," I replied.
   I thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, I
recollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with his handsome
face turned up, and his head reclining easily on his arm. He was a
person of great power in my eyes ; that was of course the reason of my
mind running on him. No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the
moonbeams. There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps, in the
garden that I dreamed of walking in all night.

KNIGHT'S SHILLING VOLUMES
                      FOR ALL READERS,
                                  PUBLISHED BY

           C. COX, 12, KING WILLIAM STREET, STRAND.


                  POSTSCRIPT, BY THE EDITOR,
          TO THE CONCLUDING VOLUME OF THE SERIES, ENTITLED
                RAMBLES BY RIVERS : THE THAMES," VOL. 11.



THISSeries was commenced in June, 1844. I t has been continued, first in
Weekly Volumes, and subsequently in Monthly Volumes, for five years. The
Series is now terminated with the publication of the 186th volume.
  The Series divides itself into three distinct portions :-
           The Weekly and Monthly Volulnes - - - -              - -
           The cabinet Portrait ~ a l l e of
                                          r ~British Worthies   - -   12
           The Cabinet History of England - - - - -             - -   26--186

   I n the original announcement of this work I thus stated the objects which IL
would endeavour to attain :-
   " W e propose to place within the reach of all readers a series of books
which shall ultimately comprehend something like that range of literature
which well-educated persons desire to have a t their command. I n this series
there will be no attempt a t exclusiveness. W e shall not take up the most
false and dangerous opinion that the understandings of the masses should be
written down to, nor will mere didactic instruction only be attempted. A
taste for knowledge is not so induced. The recreation of genial and amusing
reading should be offered in connexion with what is solid and serious. The
publishers possess many valuable copyrights which may be readily adapted to
this purpose. There is a great deal also to be done anew, in the way of
judicious compilations, of translations from foreign works, and of original
productions by authors of ability, conceived in a right spirit. W e have many
offers of assistance from writers of established reputation, who feel that the
circulation of their thoughts in a cheap pocket volume is a tribute to their
usefulness and their reputation. W e have no want of materials to conduct
this undertaking steadily and extensively."
   I now venture to believe that I have accomplished what I proposed to do.
   First,-I have endeavoured to produce a series of books which comprehends
something like that range of literature which well-educated persons desire to
have at their command. Without attempting any very exact classification of
                                                                      B

the various subjects of these volumes, they may be thus distributed into large
departments of knowledge :-
                                                                                 . ----
                                                                                 Vnlq.

   Secondly,-The very nature of the subjects thus comprised in this series
will show that mere didactic instruction has not been attempted; and that
genial and amusing reading is presented in connexion with the solid and
serious. I t would be contrary to the principles upon which I have always
regarded the duties of those who labour in the great cause of making good
literature cheap, if I had in this series presumed it necessary to write down
to the understandings of the masses. I shall never cease to believe that
whatever is best and most permanent in literature has a character of univer-
sality ; and that whenever attempts are made to " write down " to a class, or
" write up " to a class, the thing so produced is worthy of small regard, and

has little influence in its own day, and less upon the future.
    Lastly,-In    stating that I should introduce valuable copyrights into this
Series, and that I had offers of assistance from writers of established repu-
tation, it may be sufficient to point to the names of the various authors" of
these volumes, all of which are original, to show that I have fulfilled this
portion of my undertaking.
   The property of this large Series passed out of my hands as its publisher in
the beginning of 1847, in consequence of business arrangements connected
with a dissolution of partnership. Since then the additions to the Series have
been, for the most part, reprints of copyright works, which were formerly
published by me. I have never ceased to consider myself responsible for the
general character of the work, although my editorial labours had terminated
when about two-thirds of the Series were completed. I may truly add, that
my desire for the constant and increasing circulation of these Volumes con-
tinues unabated ; for I may venture to hope that each and all have a tendency
to carry forward that intellectual progress upon which the future destiny of
this country so essentially depends. And I may confidently state that in this
extensive series no single work, and no portion of a work, can be found, that
may not safely be put into the hands of the young and the uninformed, with
the security that it will neither mislead nor corrupt.
                                                                              KNIGHT.

                   By JOHN F. SOUTH, Surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital.
  T h e object of this Work is to afford some useful hints as to the means which
people have in their own power to employ when accidents happen which require
immediate attention and no medical man is at hand, and often cannot be obtained
for hours. Such cases are neither few nor unimportant, and many serious conse-
quences-nay, even death-may be prevented if a judicious person, having been put
on the track, make use of the simple remedies almost every house affords.
   " W e have seldom seen a book of wider or more sound practical utility than
this unpretending little volume. W e can conscientiously recommend Mr. South's
Manual to the notice of the public. I t is not a class-hook; IT IS EVERYBODY'S
BOOK ; and above all, travellers, emigrants, and residents in remote country places
should not fail to provide themselves with it."-Morning   Clwonicle.

       BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NIUOLL), there is
     another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
     name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
     wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
     be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUlNEAS.




       .--
          The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                              Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
    T H E REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Spring Months, with all
 the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two
 GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,
 but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the
 intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,
 within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,
 with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be seen, ready for
 immediate wear, in every size, at the Patentees' Warerooms.
