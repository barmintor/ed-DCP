  content: "\n  Ya las gentes murmuran que yo soy tu enemiga\n  \n    porque dicen que en verso doy al mundo mi yo.\n  \n  Mienten, Julia de Burgos. Mienten, Julia de Burgos.\n  La que se alza en mis versos no es tu voz: es mi voz\n  porque tú eres ropaje y la esencia soy yo; y el más\n  \n    profundo abismo se tiende entre las dos.\n  \n  Tú eres fria muñeca de mentira social,\n  \n    y yo, viril destello de la humana verdad.\n  \n  Tú, miel de cortesana hipocresías; yo no;\n  \n    que en todos mis poemas desnudo el corazón.\n  \n  Tú eres como tu mundo, egoísta;\n  \n    yo no; que en todo me lo juego a ser lo que soy yo.\n  \n  Tú eres sólo la grave señora señorona; yo no,\n  \n    yo soy la vida, la fuerza, la mujer.\n  \n  Tú eres de tu marido, de tu amo; yo no;\n  yo de nadie, o de todos, porque a todos, a\n  \n    todos en mi limpio sentir y en mi pensar me doy.\n  \n  Tú te rizas el pelo y te pintas; yo no;\n  \n    a mí me riza el viento, a mí me pinta el sol.\n  \n  Tú eres dama casera, resignada, sumisa,\n  atada a los prejuicios de los hombres; yo no;\n  que yo soy Rocinante corriendo desbocado\n  \n    olfateando horizontes de justicia de Dios.\n  \n  Tú en ti misma no mandas;\n  a ti todos te mandan; en ti mandan tu esposo, tus\n  padres, tus parientes, el cura, el modista,\n  el teatro, el casino, el auto,\n  las alhajas, el banquete, el champán, el cielo\n  \n    y el infierno, y el que dirán social.\n  \n  En mí no, que en mí manda mi solo corazón,\n  \n    mi solo pensamiento; quien manda en mí soy yo.\n  \n  Tú, flor de aristocracia; y yo, la flor del pueblo.\n  Tú en ti lo tienes todo y a todos se\n  \n    lo debes, mientras que yo, mi nada a nadie se la debo.\n  \n  Tú, clavada al estático dividendo ancestral,\n  y yo, un uno en la cifra del divisor\n  \n    social somos el duelo a muerte que se acerca fatal.\n  \n  Cuando las multitudes corran alborotadas\n  dejando atrás cenizas de injusticias quemadas,\n  y cuando con la tea de las siete virtudes,\n  tras los siete pecados, corran las multitudes,\n  contra ti, y contra todo lo injusto y lo inhumano,\n  yo iré en medio de ellas con la tea en la mano.\n\n",

I t was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began\nto cry, simultaneously.\n   I n consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by\nthe nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken\na lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of\nour becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be\nunlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and\nspirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all\nunlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a\nFriday night.\n   I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show\nbetter than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified\nby the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only\nremark, that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I\nwas still a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all\ncomplain of having been kept out of this property; and if anybody\nelse should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to\nkeep it.\n   I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers,\nat the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going people were\nshort of money about that time, or were short of faith and preferred\ncork-jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but one\nsolitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-\nbroking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance in\n                                                               B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n2              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain.\n Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss-for as to\n sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the market then-and\n ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our\n part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner\n to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to\n have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being\n disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady\n with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated\n five shillings, d l in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny short-as it took\n an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to endeavour without\n any effect to prove to her. I t is a fact which will be long remembered\nas remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died tri-\numphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was,\nto the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in\nher lifc, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was\nextremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the\nimpiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go\n\"meandering\" about the world. It was in vain to represent to her\nthat some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this ob-\njectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and\nwith an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, \"Let us\nhave no meandering.\"\n    Not to meander, myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.\n    I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or \"thereby,\" as they say in\n Scotland. I was a postlumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon\nthe light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is\nsomething strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw\nme ; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have\nof my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the church-\nyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out done\nthere in the dark night, when our little parlor was warm and bright with\nf i e and candle, and the doors of our house were-almost cruelly, i t seemed\nto me sometimes-bolted and locked against it.\n    An aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of\nwhom I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate\nof our family. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always\ncalled her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable\npersonage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married\nto a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the\nsense of the homely adage, \"handsome is, that handsome doesH-for he\nwas strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having\nonce, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined\narrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. These\nevidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay\nhim off, and effect a separation by mutual consent. H e went to India\nwith his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he\nwas once seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but\nI think it must have been a Baboo-or a Begum. Any how, from India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n                          OP DAVID COPPERFIELD.                               u\n\n\n  tidings of his death reached home, within ten years. How they affected\n  my aunt, nobody knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took\n her maiden name again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a\n long way off, established herself there as a single woman with one servant,\n and was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible\n retirement.\n     My father had once been a favorite of hers, I believe; but she was\n mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was\n \" a wax doll.\"     She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be\n not yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. H e was\n double my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitu-\n tion. H e died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I\n came into the world.\n     This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be\n excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no\n claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood ; or to have\n any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what\n follows.\n     My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low\n in spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about\n herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by some\n grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer up-stairs, to a world not at all excited\non the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting by the fire,\nthat bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and very doubtful\nof ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her, when, lifting her\neyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she saw a strange lady\ncoming up the garden.\n    My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was Miss\nBetsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the\ngarden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity\nof figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to\nnobody else.\n    When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity.\nMy father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any\nordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and\nlooked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against\nthe glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became\nperfectly flat and white in a moment.\n    She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I\nam indebted to Miss Betsey for having been-born on a Friday.\n    My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in\nthe corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and enquiringly,\nbegan on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head in\na Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown\nand a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed,\nto come and open the door. My mother went.\n    \" Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,\"      said Miss Betsey ; the emphasis\nreferring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition.\n    \" Yes,\" said my mother, faintly.\n                                       B 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\nT             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPRRIENCE\n\n    \" Miss Trotwood,\" said the visitor. \"You have heard of her, I dare\nsay ?\"\n   My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a dis-\nagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an\noverpowering pleasure.\n    \" Now you see her,\" said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and\nbegged her to walk in.\n    They went into the parlor my mother had come from, the fire in the\nbest room on the other side of the passage not being lighted-not having\nbeen lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral ; and when they were both\nseated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to\nrestrain herself, began to cry.\n    \" Oh tut, tut, tut !\" said Miss Betsey, in a hurry.      \" Don't do that!\nCome, come !\"\n    My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had\nhad her cry out.\n    \" Take off your cap, child,\" said Miss Betsey, \" and let me see you.\"\n\n    My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this\nodd request, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as\nshe was told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was\nluxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.\n    \" Why, bless my heart !\" exclaimed Miss Betsey.         \" You are a very\nBaby !\"\n    My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even\nfor her years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing,\nand said, sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish\nwidow, and would be but a childish mother if she lived. I n a short\npause which ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her\nhair, and that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid\nhope, she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up,\nher hands folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning     - at\nthe fire.\n    &lt;' I n the name of Heaven,\" said Miss Betsey, suddenly, \" why Rookery ? \"\n    \"DO you mean the house, ma'am? \" asked my mother.\n    \"Why Rookery ? \" said Miss Betsey. \" Cookery would have been\nmore to the purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of Life, either of\ny OU.\"\n    &lt;&lt;Thename was Mr. Copperfield's choice,\" returned my mother.\n \"When he bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks\nabout it.\"\n    The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall\n old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor\n Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one\n another, like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds\n of such repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as\n if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,\n some weather-beaten ragged old rooksy-nests, burdening their higher\n branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.\n     \"Where are the birds? \" asked Miss Betsey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\n   \"The -?\"            My mother had been thinking of something else.\n   \"The rooks-what has become of them ?\" asked Miss Betsey.\n   \"There have not been any since we have lived here,\" said my mother.\n\"We thought-Mr. Copperfield thought-it was quite a large rookery ;\nbut the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a\nlong while.\"\n    &lt;&lt;DavidCopperfield all over ! \" cried Miss Betsey. \"David Copper-\nfield from head to foot ! Calls a house a rookery when there 's not a rook\nnear it, and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests ! \"\n    \" Mr. Copperfield,\" returned my mother, \" is dead, and if you dare to\n\nspeak unkindly of him to me-\"\n   My poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of\ncommitting an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have\nsettled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better\ntraining for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed\nwith the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very\nmeekly, and fainted.\n   When she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,\nwhichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The\ntwilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as\nthey saw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the\nfire.\n    \"Well ? \" said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only\nbeen taking a casual look at the prospect ; \" and when do you expect-\"\n    \" I am all in a tremble,\" falteredmy mother.      \" I don't know what 's\n\nthe matter. I shall die, I am sure ! \"\n    \"No, no, no,\" said Miss Betsey. \" Have some tea.\"\n    \" Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good ? \" cried\nmy mother in a helpless manner.\n    \" Of course i t will,\"    said Miss Betsey . \" I t 's nothing but fancy.\nWhat do you call your girl ? \"\n    \" I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am,\" said my mother\n\ninnocently.\n    \"Bless the Baby ! \" exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the\nsecond sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer up-stairs, but applying\nit to my mother instead of me, \"I don't mean that. I mean your\nservant-girl.\"\n    \"Peggotty,\" said my mother.\n    \" Peggotty !\" repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation.      \" Do you\nmean to say, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church,\nand got herself named Peggotty ? \"\n    \" I t ' s her surname,\" said my mother, faintly.  \"Mr. Copperfield called\nher by it, because her Christian name was the same as mine.\"\n    \" Here ! Peggotty !\" cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlor-door. \" Tea.\nYour mistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle.\"\n    Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had\nbeen a recognised authority in the house ever since it had been a house,\nand having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the\npassage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n6             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n the door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the\n skirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee.\n     \"You were speaking about its being a girl,\" said Miss Betsey. \"I\n have no doubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a\n girl. Now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl-\"\n     \"Perhaps boy,\" my mother took the liberty of putting in.\n     \" I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,\" returned\n Miss Betsey. \"Don't contradict. Prom the moment of this girl's birth,\n child, I intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg\n you'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes\nin life with this Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with her\naffections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded\nfrom reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I\nmust make that my care.\"\n    There was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these sentences,\nas if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any\nplainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,\nat least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire : too much\nscared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and be-\nwildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what\nto say.\n    \"And was David good to you, child ? \" asked Miss Betsey, when she\nhad been silent for a little while, and these motions of her head had\ngradually ceased. \"Were you comfortable together? \"\n    \"We were very happy,\" said my mother. \" Mr. Copperfield was only\ntoo good to me.\"\n    \" What, he spoilt you, I suppose ? \" returned Miss Betsey.\n    \"For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world\nagain, yes, I fear he did indeed,\" sobbed my mother.\n    \" Well ! Don't cry! \" saidMiss Betsey. \" You were not equally matched,\nchild-if     any two people can be equally matched-and so I asked the\nquestion. You were an orphan, weren't you?\"\n    r' Yes.\"\n    \" And a governess ?\"\n    \" I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to\n\nvisit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of\nnotice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed\nto me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,\" said my mother\nsimply.\n    \" Ha ! poor Baby !\" mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon\nthe fire. \" Do you know anything ?\"\n    \" I beg your pardon, ma'am,\" faltered my mother.\n\n    \"About keeping house, for instance,\" said Miss Betsey.\n    \" Not much, I fear,\" returned my mother.     \"Not so much as I could\nwish. But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me-\"\n    (\" Much he knew about it himself! \") said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.\n   -\" And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn,\nand he very patient to teach, if the great misfortune of his death \"-my\nmother broke down again here, and could get no farther.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\n   '[Well, well !\" said Miss Betsey.\n   -&lt;&lt;     I kept my housekeeping-book regularly, and balanced it with Mr.\n  Copperfield every night,\" cried my mother in another burst of distress,\n  and breaking down again.\n     \" Well, well !\" said Miss Betsey. \" Don't cry any more.\"\n     -a    And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it,\n  except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too\n  muchlike each other, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,\"\n  resumed my mother in another burst, and breaking down again.\n     \" You'll make yourself ill,\" said Miss Betsey, \"and you know that will\n  not be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come ! You mustn't\n  do it ! \"\n     This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her\n increasing indisposition perhaps had a larger one. There was an interval\n  of silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating \" H a ! \"\n as she sat with her feet upon the fender.\n     \" David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,\"\n\n  said she, by and by. \" What did he do for you? \"\n     \" Mr. Copperfield,\" said my mother, answering with some difficulty,\n  \"was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it\n to me.\"\n     \" How much? \" asked Miss Betsey.\n     \"A hundred and five pounds a year,\" said my mother.\n     \" H e might have done worse,\" said my aunt.\n    The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much\n worse that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing\n at a glance how ill she was,-as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if\n there had been light enough,-conveyed her up-stairs to her own room\n with all speed ; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew,\n who had been for some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my\n mother, as a special messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse\n and doctor.\n    Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived\nwithin a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of portentous\n appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied over her left arm,\n stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty knowing nothing\n about her, and my mother saying nothing about her, she was quite a\nmystery in the parlor ; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers'\n cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article in her ears in that way, did\nnot detract from the solemnity of her presence.\n    The doctor having been up-stairs and come down again, and having\n satisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this unknown\nlady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some hours, laid\nhimself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of his sex, the\nmildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to take up the\nless space. H e walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet, and more\nslowly. H e carried his head on one side, partly in modest depreciation\nof himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody else. It is nothing\nto say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He couldn't have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nthrow% a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one gently,\nor half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as he walked ;\nbut he wouldn't have been rude to him, and he couldn't have been\nquick with him, for any earthly consideration.\n   Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt, with his head on one side,\nand making her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as\nhe softly touched his left ear :\n   \" Some local irritation, ma'am ? \"\n\n   \"What! \" replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like\na cork.\n   Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness-as he told my mother\nafterwards-that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind.\nBut he repeated, sweetly :\n   \" Some local irritation, ma'am ? \"\n\n   \" Nonsense !\" replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one\n\nblow.\n   Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,\nas she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called up-stairs again.\nAfter some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned.\n   \"Well?\" said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest\nto him.\n   \" Well, ma'am,\" returned Mr. Chillip, \"we are-we are progressing\nslowly, ma'am.\"\n   \" Ba-a-ah       ! \" said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous\ninterjection. And corked herself, as before.\n   Really-really-as      Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked ;\nspeaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked.\nBut he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours, as\nshe sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After another\nabsence, he again returned.\n   \" Well ? \" said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.\n\n   \" Well, ma'am,\" returned Mr. Chillip, \" we are-we           are progressing\nslowly, ma'am.\"\n   \" Ya-a-ah!\"        said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip\nabsolutely could not bear it. I t was really calculated to break his spirit,\nhe said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs, in the\ndark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.\n   Ham Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very\ndragon at his catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible\nwitness, reported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlor-door\nan hour after this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking\nto and fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make\nhis escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices\noverhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the circum-\nstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to\nexpend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest. That,\nmarching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had been\ntaking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled his\nhair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             9\nwith her own, and otherwise touzled and maltreated him. This was in\npart confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half-past twelve o'clock,\nsoon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was.\n   The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if\nat any time. He sidled into the parlor as soon as he was at liberty, and\nsaid to my aunt in his meekest manner :\n   \"Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you.\"\n   \"What upon ? \" said my aunt, sharply.\n   Mr. Chillipwas fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's\nmanner ; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to mollify\nher.\n   \" Mercy on the man, what's he doing ! \" cried my aunt, impatiently.\n\" Can 't he speak? \"\n   \"Be calm, my dear ma'am,\" said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.\n\" There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am.     Be calm.\"\n   I t has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn 't shake\nhim, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own\nhead at him, but in a way that made him quail.\n    \"Well, ma'am,\" resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, \" I\nam happy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well over.\"\n   During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery\nof this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.\n   \" How is she?\" said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still\n\ntied on one of them.\n   \" Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,\" returned\n\nMr. Chillip. \" Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to\nbe, under these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any\nobjection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. I t may do her good.\"\n   \" And she. How is she ?\" said my aunt, sharply.\n    Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my\naunt like an amiable bird.\n   \" The baby,\" said my aunt. \" How is she ?\"\n   '&lt; Ma'am,\" returned Mr. Chillip, \" I apprehended you had known.\nIt's a boy.\"\n   My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in\nthe manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put\nit on bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a dis-\ncontented fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it\nwas popularly supposed I was entitled to see ; and never came back any\nmore.\n    No. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey\nTrotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows,\nthe tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light\nupon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all\nsuch travellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once\nwas he, without whom I had never been.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER 11.\n                                I OBSERVE.\n\n    THEfirst objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look\n far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty\n hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so\n dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,\n and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't\n peck her in preference to apples.\n    I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed\n to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going\n unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind\n which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of\n Peggotty's fore-finger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being\n roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.\n    This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go\n farther back into such times than many of us suppose ; just as I believe\n the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite\n wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most\n grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater pro-\npriety be said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it ; the\nrather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness, and\ngentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an inheritance\nthey have preserved from their childhood.\n    I might have a misgiving that I am \"meandering \" in stopping to say\nthis, but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in\npart upon my own experience of myself ; and if it should appear from any-\nthing I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observa-\ntion, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I\nundoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.\n   Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first\nobjects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of\nthings, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let\nme see.\n   There comes out of the cloud, our house-not new to me, but quite\nfamiliar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's\nkitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in the\ncentre, without any pigeons in it ; a great dog-kennel in a corner, without\nany dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me, walking\nabout, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who\ngets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as I\nlook at him through the kitchen-window, who makes me shiver, he is so\nfierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me\nwith their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at night :\nas a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            11\n      Here is a long passage-what an enormous perspective I make of it!-\n   leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front-door. A dark store-room\n   opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at night ; for I don't\n  know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea-chests, when\n  there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light, letting a mouldy air\n  come out at the door, in which there is the smell of soap, pickles, pepper,\n   candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then there are the two parlors : the\n  parlor in which we sit of an evening, my mother and I and Peggotty-\n  for Peggotty is quite our companion, when her work is done and we are\n  alone-and the best parlor where we sit on a Sunday ; grandly, but not\n  so comfortably. There is something of a doleful air about that room to\n  me, for Peggotty has told me-I don't know when, but apparently ages\n  go-about myfather's funera1,and the company having their black cloaks put\n  on. One Sunday night my mother reads to Peggotty and me in there,\n  how Lazarus was raised up from the dead. And I am so frightened that\n  they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed, and shew me the quiet\n  churchyard out of the bedroom window, with the dead all lying in their\n  graves at rest, below the solemn moon.\n     There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of\n  that churchyard ; nothing half so shady as its trees ; nothing half so quiet\n  as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up, early\n in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my mother's room, to\n look out at it ; and I see the red light shining on the sun-dial, and think\n within myself, cc I s the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that it can tell the time\n again ? \"\n     Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a\n window near it, out of which our house can be seen, and is seen many\n times during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make her-\n self as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames.\n But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does,\n and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the\n clergyman. But I can't always look at him-I know him without that\n white thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and\nperhaps stopping the service to enquire-and what am I to do? It's\na dreadful thing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my\nmother, but she pretends not to see me.            I look at a boy in the\naisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at\nthe open door through the porch, and there I see a stray sheep-I don't\nmean a sinner, but mutton-half making up his mind to come into the\n church. I feel that if I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted\nto say something out loud; and what would become of me then ! I\nlook up at the monumental tablets on the wall, and try to think of\nMr. Bodgers late of this parish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must\nhave been, when affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physi-\ncians were in vain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he\nwas in vain; and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week.\nI look from Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit;\nand think what a good place it would be to play in, and what a castle\nit would make, with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n1%             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nhaving the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head.\n I n time my eyes gradually shut u p ; and, from seeming to hear the\n clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I\n fall off the seat with a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive,- by-\n Peggotty.\n    And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed bedroom-\nwindows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the ragged\n old rooksy-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front\n garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the yard where the\n empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are-a very preserve of butterflies, as\n I rcmember it, with a high fence, and a gate and padlock ; where the\nfruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than fruit has ever been since,\nin any other garden, and where my mother gathers some in a basket,\nwhile I stand by, bolting furtive gooseberries, and trying to lookunmoved.\nA great wind rises, and the summer is gone in a moment. We are\nplaying in the winter twilight, dancing about the parlor. When my\nmother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow-chair, I watch her\nwinding her bright curls round her fingers, and straitening her waist, and\nnobody knows better than I do that she likes to look so well, and is proud\nof being so pretty.\n    That is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that\nwe were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most\nthings to her direction, were among the first opinions-if they may be so\ncalled-that I ever derived from what I saw.\n    Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlor fire, alone. I\nhad been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read\nvery perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I\nremember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were a sort\nof vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy ; but having leave, as a\nhigh treat, to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening\nat a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon my post (of course) than\nhave gone to bed. I had reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty\nseemed to swell and grow immensely large. I propped my eyelids open\nwith my two forefingers, and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at\nwork; at the little bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread-how\nold it looked, being so wrinkled in all directions !-at the little house with\na thatched roof, where the yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a\nsliding lid, with a view of Saint Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted\non the top ; at the brass thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I\nthought lovely. I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything,\nfor a moment, I was gone.\n    \"Peggotty,\" says I, suddenly, \"were you ever married?\"\n    \" Lord, Master Davy,\" replied Peggotty. \"What 's put marriage in\nyour head !\"\n    She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she\nstopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its\nthread's length.\n    \" But were you ever married, Peggotty ? \" says I. \" You are a very\nhandsome woman, an't you ?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           13\n   I thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly ; but of\nanother school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There was\na redvelvet footstool in the best parlor, on which my mother had painted\na nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty's complexion,\nappeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was smooth,\nand Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference.\n   \" Me handsome, Davy !\" said Peggotty. \" Lawk, no, my dear ! But\nwhat put marriage in your head ? \"\n   \" I don't know !-You mustn't marry more than one person at a time,\nmay you, Peggotty ?\"\n   \" Certainly not,\" says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.\n   \"But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may\nmarry another person, mayn't you, Peggotty ? \"\n   \"You MAY,\" says Peggotty, \"if you choose, my dear. That's a\nmatter of oninion.\" -\n   r c But wcat is your opinion, Peggotty ? \" said I.\n   I asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so curiously\nat me.\n    \" My opinion is,\" said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little\nindecision and going on with her work, \"that I never was married myself,\nMaster Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's all I know about the\nsubject.\"\n   \" You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you? \" said I, after sitting\nquiet for a minute.\n   I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was\nquite mistaken : for she laid aside her work, (which was a stocking of her\nown,) and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and\ngave it a good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being\nvery plump, whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed,\nsome of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recol-\nlect two\n-       .\n           bursting to the opposite side of the parlor, while she was\nhugging me.\n   \" Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills,\" said Peggotty,\n\nwho was not quite right in the name yet, \" for I an't heard half\nenou~h.\"\n---.  -~\n       Q-\n   I couldn't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or why she\nwas so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those\nmonsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in\nthe sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled\nthem by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on\naccount of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,\nas natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in\nshort we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did at least; but I had my\ndoubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various\nparts of her face and arms, all the time.\n   We had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when\nthe garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my\nmother, looking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman\nwith beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from\nchurch last Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n14            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n    As my mother stooped down on the threshhold to take me in her arms\n and kiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little\n fellow than a monarch-or something like that ; for my later understanding\n comes, I am sensible, to my aid here.\n    \" What does that mean ? \" I asked him, over her shoulder.\n    H e patted me on the head ; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep\n voice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in\n touching me-which it did. I put it away, as well as I could.\n    \" Oh Davy ! \" remonstrated my mother.\n    \" Dear boy ! \" said the gentleman. \" I cannot wonder at his devotion!\"\n    I never saw such a beautiful color on my mother's face before. She\n gently chid me for being rude ; and, keeping me close to her shawl, turned\nto thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home.\nShe put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with his own,\nshe glanced, I thought, at me.\n    \" Let us say ' good night,' my fine boy,\" said the gentleman, when he\nhad bent his head-1 saw him !-over my mother's little glove.\n    \" Good night !\" said I.\n\n    \" Come ! Let us be the best friends in the world ! \" said the gentleman,\nlaughing. \" Shake hands ! \"\n   My right hand was in my mother's left, so I gave him the other.\n    \" Why that's the wrong hand, Davy ! \" laughed the gentleman.\n    My mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my\nformer reason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him the other, and\nhe shook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away.\n    At this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last\nlook with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut.\n   Peggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured the\nfastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlor. My mother, con-\ntrary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the fire,\nremained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.\n    \"-Hope     you have had a pleasant evening, ma'am,\" said Peggotty,\nstanding as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick\nin her hand.\n    \"Much obliged to you, Peggotty,\" returned my mother, in a cheerful\nvoice, \" I have had a very pleasant evening.\"\n   \"A stranger or so makes an agreeable change,\" suggested Peggotty.\n   \" A very agreeable change indeed,\" returned my mother.\n\n   Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room,\nand my mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so\nsound asleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.\nWhen I half awoke from this uncomfortable dose, I found Peggotty and\nmy mother both in tears, and both talking.\n   \"Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked,\" said\nPeggotty. \"That I say, and that I swear !\"\n   \" Good Heavens ! \" cried my mother.       \" You '11 drive me mad ! Was\never any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am ! Why do I do\nmyself the injustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married,\nPeggotty ?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            15\n   \" God knows you have, ma'am,\" returned Peggotty.\n     \" Then how can you dare,\" said my mother-\" you know I don't mean\n  how can you dare, Peggotty, but how can you have the heart-to make me\n  so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me, when you are well\n  aware that I haven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to ! \"\n     a The more 's the reason,\" returned Peggotty, \" for saying that it\n won't do. No ! That it won't do. No ! No price could make it do.\n No ! \"-I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away,\n she was so emphatic with it.\n    \"How can you be so aggravating,\" said my mother, shedding\n more tears than before, \" as to talk in such an unjust manner ! How\n can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when I tell\n you over and over again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest\n civilities nothing has passed! You talk of admiration. What am I\n to do ? If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault ?\n What am I to do, I ask you? Would you wish me to shave my head\n and black my face, or disfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something\n of that sort ? I dare say you would, Peggotty. I dare say you 'd quite\n enjoy it.\"\n    Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought.\n    \"And my dear boy,\" cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair in\n which I was, and caressing me, \"my own little Davy ! I s it to be hinted\nto me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest\nlittle fellow that ever was ! \"\n    \" Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,\" said Peggotty.\n    \"You did, Peggotty !\" returned my mother. \" You know you did.\nWhat else was it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature,\nwhen you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I\nwouldn't buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed\nthe whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy. You know it is,\nPeggotty. You can't deny it.\" Then, turning affectionately to me, with\nher cheek against mine, \" Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy ? Am I a\nnasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama ? Say I am, my child ; say 'yes ;' dear boy,\nand Peggotty will love you, and Peggotty's love is a great deal better\nthan mine, Davy. I dont love you at all, do I ? \"\n    At this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest of the\nparty, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was quite heart-\nbroken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded ten-\nderness I called Peggotty a \" Beast.\" That honest creature was in deep\naflhction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless on the\noccasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off, when, after\nhaving made it up with my mother, she kneeled down by the elbow-\nchair, and made it up with me.\n    We went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for a long\ntime; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed, I found\nmy mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me. I fell asleep in\nher arms, after that, and slept soundly.\n   Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again,\nor whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared, I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n16            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\ncannot recal. I don't profess to be clear about dates. But there he was,\nin church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too, to\nlook at a famous geranium we had, in the parlor-window. I t did not\nappear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked\nmy mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose\nit for himself, but he refused to do that-I could not understand why-\nso she plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would\nnever, never, part with it any more ; and I thought he must be quite a fool\nnot to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.\n    Peggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always\nbeen. My mother deferred to her very much-more than usual, it occurred\nto me-and we were all three excellent friends; still we were different\nfrom what we used to be, and were not so comfortable among our-\nselves. Sometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my\nmother's wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her\ngoing so often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, to my\nsatisfaction, make out how it was.\n    Gradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black\nwhiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy\njealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child's instinctive\n dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make much of my\nmother without any help, it certainly was not the reason that I might have\n found if I had been older. No such thing came into my mind, or near\n it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were ; but as to making a net of\n a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it, that was, as\n yet, beyond me.\n    One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when\n Mr. Murdstone-I knew him by that name now-came by, on horseback.\n H e reined up his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to\n Lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht, and\n merrily proposed t o take me on the saddle before him if I would like the\n ride.\n    The air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the idea\n of the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the\n garden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent up-stairs to\n Peggotty to be made spruce ; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone dis-\n mounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over his arm, walked slowly\n up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while my mother\n walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company. I recol-\n lect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I recol-\n lect how closely they appeared to be examining the sweetbriar between\n them, as they strolled along ; and how, from being in a perfectly angelic\n  temper, Peggotty turned cross in a moment, and brushed my hair the\n  wrong way, excessively hard.\n     Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green\n  turf by the side of the road. H e held me quite easily with one arm,\n  and I don't think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my\n  mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, and\n  looking up in his face. H e had that kind of shallow black eye-I want\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\na better word to express an eye that has no depth i n it to be looked into-\nwhich, when it is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be dis-\nfigured, for a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced\nat him, I observed that appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what\nhe was thinking about so closely. His hair and whiskers were blacker\nand thicker, looked at so near, than even I had given them credit for\nbeing. A squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted\nindication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me\nof the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-\nyear before. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black,\nand brown, of his complexion- confound his complexion, and his\nmemory !-made        me think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very\nhandsome man. I have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought\nhim so too.\n    We went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking\ncigars in a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four\nchairs, and had a large rough jacket on. I n a corner was a heap of coats\nand boat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.\n    They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when\nwe came in, and said \" Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were\n dead ! \"\n    \"Not yet,\" said Mr. Murdstone.\n    \" And who's this shaver? \" said one of the gentlemen, taking hold\nof me.\n    \" That's Davy,\" returned Mr. Murdstone.\n\n    \" Davy who ? \" said the gentleman.     \" Jones ? \"\n\n    \" Copperfield,\" said Mr. Murdstone.\n\n    \" What ! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield's incumbrance ? \" cried the\n gentleman. \" The pretty little widow ? \"\n     \" Quinion,\" said Mr. Murdstone, \" take care, if you please. Somebody's\n sharp.\"\n     \" Who is ? \" asked the gentleman, laughing.\n    I looked up, quickly; being curious to know.\n    \" Only Brooks of Sheffield,\" said Mr. Murdstone.\n    I was quite relieved to find it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for, as\n first, I really thought it was I.\n    There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of\n Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he\n was mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After\n some laughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said :\n     \"And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the\n projected business ? \"\n     \" Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at pre-\n\n sent,\" replied Mr. AEnrdstone; \"but he is not generally favourable, I\n believe.\"\n     There was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring\n the bell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did;\n and when the wine came, he made me have a little, with a biscuit, an$\n before I drank it, stand up and say \"Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield !\n                                      C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n18             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n The toast was received with great applause, and such hearty laughter that\nit made me laugh too; at which they laughed the more. I n short, we\nquite enjoyed ourselves.\n   We walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, and\nlooked at things through a telescope-I could make out nothing myself\nwhen it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could-and then we came\nback to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time we were out, the two\ngentlemen smoked incessantly-which, I thought, if I might judge from the\nsmell of their roughcoats, they must have been doing, ever since the coatshad\nfirst come home from the tailor's. I must not forget that we went on\nboard the yacht, where they all three descended into the cabin, and were busy\nwith some papers. I saw them quite hard at work, when I looked down\nthrough the open skylight. They left me, during this time, with a very nice\nman with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it,\nwho had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on, with \" Skylark \" in capital\nletters across the chest. I thought it was his name; and that as he lived\non board ship and hadn't a street-door to put his name on, he put it\nthere instead; but when I called him Mr. Skylark, he said it meant the\nvessel.\n   I observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the\ntwo gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked freely with\none another, but seldom with him. I t appeared to me that he was more\nclever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with some-\nthing of my own feeling. I remarked that once or twice when Mr.\nQuinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to make\nsure of his not being displeased ; and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the\nother gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod upon his foot, and gave him\na secret caution with his eyes, to observe Mr. &amp;!turdstone, who was sitting\nstern and silent. Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed at all\nthat day, except at the Sheffield joke-and that, by the by, was his\nown.\n   MTe went home early in the evening. I t was a very fine evening, and\nmy mother and he had another stroll by the sweet-briar, while I was sent\nin to get my tea, When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the\nday I had had, and what they had said and done. I mentioned what they\nhad said about her, and she laughed, and told me they were impudent\nfellows who talked nonsense-but I knew it pleased her. I knew it quite\nas well as I know it now. I took the opportunity of asking if she was\nat all acquainted with Nr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered\nNo, only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork\nway.\n   Can I say of her face-altered as I have reason to remember it,\nperished as I know i t is-that it is gone, when here it comes before me at\nthis instant, as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a\ncrowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it\nfaded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell\nthat night ? Can I say she ever changed, when my remembrance brings\nher back to life, thus only ; and, truer to its loving youth than I have been,\nor man ever is, still holds fast what it cherished then?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                              19\n    I write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk,\n and she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully by the\n side of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing,\n said :\n    'c What was it they said, Davy ?      Tell me again. I can't believe it.\"\n    \" ' Bewitching-'       \" I began.\n    My mother put her hands upon her lips to stop me.\n    \" It was never bewitching,\" she said, laughing. '&lt; It never could have\nbeen bewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn't !\"\n    \"Yes it was. 'Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield,\"' I repeated stoutly.\n \" And 'pretty.' \"\n    \" No no, it was never pretty.         Not pretty,\" interposed my mother,\n laying her fingers on my lips again.\n    \" Yes it was. ' Pretty little widow.' \"\n    \" What foolish, impudent creatures !\" cried my mother, laughing and\ncovering her face. \"What ridiculous men ! An't they? Davy dear-\"\n    \" Well, Ma.\"\n\n    \"Don't tell Peggotty ; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully\n angry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn't know.\"\n    I promised, of course ; and we kissed one another over and over again,\n and I soon fell fast asleep.\n   I t seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next day when\nPeggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am about to\nmention ; but it was probably about two months afterwards.\n   We were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out\nas before), in company with the stocking and the yard measure, and the\nbit of wax, and the box with Saint Paul's on the lid, and the crocodile\nbook, when Peggotty, after looking at me several times, and opening\nher mouth as if she were going to speak, without doing it-which I\nthought was merely gaping, or I should have been rather alarmed-said\ncoaxingly :\n    \"Master Davy, how should you like to go along with me and spend a\nfortnight at my brothcr's at Yarmouth? Wouldn't tAat be a treat? \"\n   \" I s your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty? \" I enquired, pro-\nvisionally.\n    \" Oh what an agreeable man he is ! \" cried Peggotty, holding up her\nhands. \"Then there's the sea; and the boats and ships; and the\nfishermen ; and the beach ; and Am to play with-\"\n    Peggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned in my first chapter ;ut\nshe spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar.\n    I was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it woula\nindeed be a treat, but what would my mother say?\n    \"Why then I'll as good as bet a guinea,\" said Peggotty, intent uponmy\nface, \" that she '11 let us go. I 1' 1 ask her, if you like, as soon as ever she\ncomes home. There now ! \"\n   \" But what 's she to do while we 're away ? \" said I, putting my small\n\nelbows on the table to argue the point. \" She can 't live by herself.\"\n   If Peggotty were looking for a hole, all of a sudden, in the heel of that\nstocking, i t must have been a very little one indeed, and not worth\ndarning.                                   c 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n  \"    I say ! Peggotty ! She can 't live by herself, you know.\"\n  \"    Oh bless you! \" said Peggotty, looking at me again at last. \"Don't\nyou know? She's going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper.\nMrs. Grayper's going to have a lot of company.\"\n    Oh ! If that was it, I was quite ready to go. I waited, in the utmost\nimpatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper's (for it was\nthat identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out\nthis great idea. Without being nearly so much surprised as I had expected,\nmy mother entered into it readily; and it was all arranged that night, and\nmy board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for.\n    The day soon came for our going. I t was such an early day that it\ncame soon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and half afraid\nthat an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsioil of\nnature, might interpose to stop the expedition. We were to go in a\ncarrier's cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast. I would\nhave given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night,\nand sleep in my hat and boots.\n    I t touches me nearly now, although I tell it lightly, to recollect how\neager I was to leave my happy home ; to think how little I suspected what\nI did leave for ever.\n    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier's cart was at the gate, and\nmy mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for the\nold place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry. I am\n glad to know that my mother cried too, and that I felt her heart beat\nagainst mine.\n    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my mother\nran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that she might kiss me\nonce more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which\n she lifted up her face to mine, and did so.\n    As we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to where\n she was, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved. I was\nlooking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business it\n was of his. Peggotty, who was also looking back on the other side,\n seemed anything but satisfied ; as the face she brought back into the cart\n denoted.\n     I sat looking at Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this supposi-\n titious case : whether, if she were employed to lose me like the boy in\n the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons\n she would shed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\n\n\n\n                            CHAPTER 111.\n                           I HATE A CHANGE.\n    THEcarrier's horse was the laziest horse in the world, I should hope,\nand shuffled along, with his head down, as if he liked to keep the people\nwaiting to whom the packages were directed. I fancied, indeed, that he\n sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection, but the carrier said he\nwas only troubled with a cough.\n    The carrier had a way of keeping his head down, like his horse, and of\ndrooping sleepily forward as he drove, with one of his arms on each of his\nknees. I say \"drove,\" but it struck me that the cart would have gone\nto Yarmouth quite as well without him, for the horse did all that ; and as\nto conversation, he had no idea of it but whistling.\n    Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee, which would\nhave lasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by the\nsame conveyance. We ate a good deal, and slept a good deal. Peggotty\nalways went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket, her\nhold of which never relaxed; and I could not have believed unless I had\nheard her do it, that one defenceless woman could have snored so\nmuch.\n   We made so many deviations up and down lanes, and were such a\nlong time delivering a bedstead at a public-house, and calling at other\nplaces, that I was quite tired, and very glad, when we saw Yarmouth.\nI t looked rather spongey and soppy, I thought, as I carried my eye\nover the great dull waste that lay across the river; and I could not\nhelp wondering, if the world were really as round as my geography-\nbook said, how any part of it came to be so flat. But I reflected that\nYarmouth might be situated at one of the poles; which would account\nfor it.\n    As we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying\na straight low line under the sky, I hinted to Peggotty that a mound\n or so might have improved i t ; and also that if the land had been a little\n more separated from the sea, and the town and the tide had not been\n quite so much mixed up, like toast and water, it would have been nicer.\n But Peggotty said, with greater emphasis than usual, that we must take\n things as we found them, and that, for her part, she was proud to call\n herself a Yarmouth Bloater.\n    When we got into the street (which was strange enough to me), and\n smelt the fish, and pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors\n walking about, and the carts jingling up and down over the stones, I felt\n that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to Peg-\n gotty, who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency, and\n told me it was well known (I suppose to those who had the good fortune\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            23\nthere were some common colored pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture\nsubjects ; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without\nseeing the whole interior of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view.\nAbraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow cast\ninto a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these. Over the\nlittle mantel-shelf, was a picture of the Sarah Jane lugger, built a t\nSunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to i t ; a work of art,\ncombining composition with carpentery, which I considered to be one of\nthe most enviable possessions that the world could afford. There were\nsome hooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use of which I did not divine\nthen; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort, which\nserved for seats and eked out the chairs.\n    All this, I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold-child-\nlike, according to my theory-and then Peggotty opened a little door and\nshowed me my bedroom. I t was the completest and most desirable\nbedroom ever seen-in the stern of the vessel ; with a little window, where\nthe rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass, just the right\nheight for me, nailed against the wall, and framed with oyster-shells ; a\nlittle bed, which there was just room enough to get into; and a nosegay\nof seaweed in a blue mug on the table. The walls were whitewashed as\nwhite as milk, and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache\nwith its brightness. One thing I particularly noticed in this delightful\nhouse, was the smell of fish ; which was so searching, that when I took\nout my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose, I found it smelt exactly as\nif i t had wrapped up a lobster. On my imparting this discovery\nin confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother dealt in\nlobsters, crabs, and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these\ncreatures, in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another,\nand never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of, were usually\nto be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were\nkept.\n   We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom\nI had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back,\nabout a quarter of a mile off. Likewise by a most beautiful little\ngirl (or I thought her so) with a necklace of blue beads on, who\nwouldn't let me kiss her when I offered to, but ran away and hid herself.\nBy and by, when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs,\nmelted butter, and potatoes, with a chop for me, a hairy man with\na very good-natured face came home. As he called Peggotty \"Lass,\"\nand gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I had no doubt, from the\ngeneral propriety of her conduct, that he was her brother; and so he\nturned out-being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty, the\nmaster of the house.\n    \" Glad to see you, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"You'll find us rough,\nsir, but you '11 find us ready.\"\n    I thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such\na delightful place.\n    \" How's    your Ma, sir,\" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Did you leave her\npretty jolly ? \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AXD EXPERIENCE\n\n    I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could\nwish, and that she desired her compliments-which was a polite fiction\non my part.\n    \" I 'm much obleeged to her, I 'm sure,\"     said Mr. Peggotty. c r Well\nsir, if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her,\" nodding at\nhis sister, \" and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of your\ncompany.\"\n    Having done the honors of his house in this hospitable manner,\nMr. Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water, remarking\nthat 'I cold would never get his muck off.\"        He soon returned, greatly\nimproved in appearance ; but so rubicund, that I couldn't help thinking\nhis face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs, and crawfish,-that\nit went into the hot water very black, and came out very red.\n   After tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the nights\nbeing cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat\nthat the imagination of man could conceive. To hear the wind getting\nup out at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat\noutside, and to look at the fire, and think that there was no house near\nbut this one, and this one a boat, was like enchantment. Little Em'ly\nhad overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my side upon the lowest\nand least of the lockers, which was just large enough for us two, and just\nfitted into the chimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was\nknitting on the opposite side of the fire. Peggotty at her needle-work\nwas as much at home with Saint Paul's and the bit of wax-candle, as if\nthey had never known any other roof. Ham, who had been giving me\nmy first lesson in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme of telling\nfortunes with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of his\nthumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe.\nI felt it was a time for conversation and confidence.\n    \" Mr. Peggotty ! \" says I.\n    \"Sir,\" says he.\n    \" Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort\nof ark ? \"\n   Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered :\n    \" No, sir. I never giv him no name.\"\n    \"Who gave him that name, then? \" said I, putting question number\ntwo of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty.\n    \"Why, sir, his father giv it him,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n    \" I thought you were his father ! \"\n    \" My brother Joe was his father,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n\n    \" Dead, Mr. Peggotty ? \"     I hinted, after a respectful pause.\n    \" Drowndead,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n    I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father,\nand began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to\nanybody else there. I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind\nto have it out with Mr. Peggotty.\n    \" Little Em'ly,\" I said, glancing at her. \"She is your daughter, isn 't\nshe, Mr. Peggotty ? \"\n    \" No, sir.   My brother in law, Tom, was her father.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            25\n\n    I couldn 't help it. \" -Dead, Mr. Peggotty ? \" I hinted, after another\nrespectful silence.\n    \" Drowndead,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n    I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the\nbottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow. So I said :\n    \" Havn 't you any children, Mr. Peggotty ? \"\n\n    \" No, master,\" he answered with a short laugh. \" I 'm a bacheldore.\"\n    \" A bachelor ! \"    I said, astonished. \" Why, who 's that, Mr. Peg-\ngotty ? \" Pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting.\n    \" That's Missis Gummidge,\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n    \" Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty ?\"\n    But at this point Peggotty-I mean my own peculiar Peggotty-\nmade such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions,\nthat I could only sit and look at all the silent company, until it\nwas time to go to bed. Then, in the privacy of my own little cabin,\nshe informed me that Ham and Em'ly were an orphan nephew and\nniece, whom my host had at different times adopted in their child-\nhood, when they were left destitute ; and that Mrs. Gummidge was\nthe widow of his partner in a boat, who had died very poor. EIe\nwas but a poor man himself, said Peggotty, but as good as gold\nand as true as steel-those were her similies. The only subject, she\ninformed me, on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore an\noath, was this generosity of his; and if it were ever referred to, by any\none of them, he struck the table a heavy blow with his right hand (had\nsplit it on one such occasion), and swore a dreadful oath that he would\nbe ' Gormed' if he didn't cut and run for good, if it was ever men-\ntioned again. It appeared, in answer to my inquiries, that nobody\nhad the least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb passive to be\ngormed; but that they all regarded it as constituting a most solemn\nimprecation.\n    I was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened to the\n women's going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end\n of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves\n on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, in a very luxurious state of\n mind, enhanced by my being sleepy. As slumber gradually stole upon\n me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the flat so\n fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the\n night. But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after all; and that a\n man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything\n did happen.\n    Nothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as it\n shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out\n with little Em'ly, picking up stones upon the beach.\n    \" You're quite a sailor, I suppose ? \" I said to Em'ly. I don't know\n that I supposed any thing of the kind, but I felt it an act of gallantry to\n say something; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little\n image of itself, at the moment, in her bright eye, that it came into my head\n to say this.\n     \" No,\" replied Em'ly, shaking her head, \" I'm afraid of the sea.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n26            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n    \"Afraid !\" I said, with a becoming air of boldness, and looking very\n big at the mighty ocean. \"Ia'nt ! \"\n    \"Ah ! but it's cruel,\" said Em'ly. \" I have seen it very cruel to some\n of our men. I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, all to pieces.\"\n    \"I hope i t was'nt the boat that -\"\n    \" That father was drownded in ?\" said Em'ly. \" No. Not that one, I\nnever see that boat.\"\n    \" Nor him ?\" I asked her.\n    Little Em'ly shook her head. \" Not to remember ! \"\n    Here was a coincidence ! I immediately went into an explanation how\n I had never seen my own father; and how my mother and I had always\nlived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and lived so then, and\nalways meant to live so ; and how my father's grave was in the churchyard\nnear our house, and shaded by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I\nhad walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning. But\nthere were some differences between Em'ly's orphanhood and mine, it ap-\npeared. She had lost her mother before her father; and where her father's\ngrave was no one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of the\nsea.\n    \"Besides,\" said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles,\n\" your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father\nwas a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman's daughter, and my uncle\nDan is a fisherman.\n    \" Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he ? \" said I.\n    \" Uncle Dan-yonder,\" answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house.\n    \"Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think? \"\n    \" Good? \" said Em'ly.    \" If I was ever to be a lady, I 'd give him a\nsky-blue coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet\nwaistcoat, a cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of\nmoney .\"\n   I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures.\nI must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease\nin the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and that I\nwas particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat ; but I kept these\nsentiments to myself.\n   Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration\nof these articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again,\npicking up shells and pebbles.\n    \" You would like to be a lady ? \" I said.\n   Emily looked at me, and laughed and nodded \"yes.\"\n   \" I should like it very much.     We would all be gentlefolks together,\nthen. Me, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't\nmind then, when there come stormy weather.-Not for our own sakes, I\nmean. We would for the poor fishermen's, to be sure, and we 'd help 'em\nwith money when they come to any hurt.\"\n   This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all\nimprobable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it,\nand little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly,\n    \" Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now ? \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            27\n    It was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I had seen\n a moderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my\n heels, with an awful recollection of her drowned relations. However, I\n said \" No,\" and I added, \"You don't seem to be, either, though you say\nyou are;\"-for     she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of\n old jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon, and I was afraid of\nher falling over.\n    \"I'm not afraid in this way,\" said little Em'ly. \"But I wake\nwhen it blows, and tremble to think of uncle Dan and Ham, and\nbelieve I hear'em crying out for help. That's why I should like so\nmuch to be a lady. But I ' m not afraid in this way. Not a bit. Look\nhere ! \"\n    She started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which pro-\ntruded from the place we stood upon, and overhung the deep water at\nsome height, without the least defence. The incident is so impressed on\nmy remembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form\nhere, I daresay, accurately as it was that day, and little Em'ly springing\nforward to her destruction (as it appeared to me), with a look that I have\nnever forgotten, directed far out to sea.\n   The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me,\nand I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had uttered ; fruitlessly\nin any case, for there was no one near. But there have been times since,\nin my manhood, many times there have been, when I have thought, I s it\npossible, among the possibilities of hidden things, that in the sudden\nrashness of the child and her wild look so far off, there was any merciful\nattraction of her into danger, any tempting her towards him permitted\non the part of her dead father, that her life might have a chance of\nending that day. There has been a time since when I have wondered\nwhether, if the life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance,\nand so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it, and if her pre-\nservation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I ought to have\nheld it up to save her. There has been a time since-I            do not say\nit lasted long, but it has been-when I have asked myself the question,\nwould it have been better for little Em'ly to have had the waters close\nabove her head that morning in my sight; and when I have answered\nYes, it would have been.\n   This may be premature. I have set it down too soon, perhaps. But\nlet it stand.\n   We strolled a long way, and loaded ourselves with things that we\nthought curious, and put some stranded star-fish carefully back into\nthe water-I hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be\nquite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing\nso, or the reverse-and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty's\ndwelling. We stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to\nexchange\n   . .     an innocent kiss, and went in to breakfast glowing with health\nand pleasure.\n     Like two young mavishes,\" Mr. Peggotty said. I knew this meant,\nin our local dialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as a com-\npliment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n28            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n   Of course I was in love with little Em'ly. I am sure Iloved that baby\nquite as truly, quite as tenderly, with greater purity, and more disinterest-\nedness, than can enter into the best love of a later time of life, high and\nennobling as it is. I am sure my fancy raised up something round that\nblue-eyed mite of a child, which etherealised, and made a very angel of\nher. If, any sunny forenoon, she had spread a little pair of wings and\nflown away before my eyes, I don't think I should have regarded it as\nmuch more than I had had reason to expect.\n   We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving\nmanner, hours and hours. The days sported by us, as if Time had not\ngrown up himself yet, but were a child too, and always at play. I told\nEm'ly I adored her, and that unless she confessed she adored me I should\nbe reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword. She said she\ndid, and I have no doubt she did.\n   As to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty in our\nway, little Em'ly and I had no such trouble, because we had no future.\nWe made no more provision for growing older, than we did for growing\nyounger. We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty, who\nused to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little locker\nside by side, \" Lor ! wasn 't it beautiful ! \" Mr. Peggotty smiled at us\nfrom behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing\nelse. They had something of the sort of pleasure in us, I suppose,\nthat they might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the\nColosseum.\n   I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself\nso agreeable as she might have been expected to do, under the cir-\ncumstances of her residence with Mr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge's was\nrather a fretful disposition, and she whimpered more sometimes than\nwas comfortable for other parties in so small an establishment. I was\nvery sorry for her ; but there were moments when it would have been\nmore agreeable, I thought, if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient\napartment of her own to retire to, and had stopped there until her spirits\nrevived.\n   Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public house called The Willing\nMind. I discovered this, by his being out on the second or third evening\nof our visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge's looking up at the dutch clock,\nbetween eight and nine, and saying he was there, and that, what was\nmore, she had known in the morning he would go there.\n   Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day, and had burst into\ntears in the forenoon, when the fire smoked. \"I am a lone lorn creetur',\"\nwere Mrs. Gummidge's words, when that unpleasant occurrence took\nplace, \"and everythink goes contrairy with me.\"\n   \" Oh, it 1' 1 soon leave off,\" said Peggotty-I again mean our Peggotty\n-\" and besides, you know, it's not more disagreeable to you than to us.\"\n   \" I feel it more,\" said Mrs. Gnmmidge.\n   I t was a very cold day, with cutting blasts of wind. Mrs. Gummidge's\npeculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and\nsnuggest in the place, as her chair was certainly the easiest, but it didn't\n suit her that day at all. She was constantly complaining of the cold, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n                         OP DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            29\nof its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called \"the creeps.\"\nA t last she shed tears on that subject, and said again that she was \" a lone\nlorn creetur' and everythink went contrairy with her.\"\n     \" It is certainly very cold,\" said Peggotty. \"Everybody must feel it so.\"\n    rc I feel it more than other people,\" said Mrs. Gummidge.\n     So at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately\nafter me, to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction.\nThe fish were small and bony, and the potatoes were a little burnt. We\nall acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment; but\nMrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than we did, and shed tears again,\nand made that former declaration with great bitterness.\n    Accordingly, when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o'clock, this\nunfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner in a very wretched\nand miserable condition. Peggotty had been working cheerfully. Ham\nhad been patching up a great pair of water-boots; and I, with little\nEm'ly by my side, had been reading to them. Mrs. Gummidge had never\nmade any other remark than a forlorn sigh, and had never raised her eyes\nsince tea.\n     \" Well, Mates,\" said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, \" and how are you ?\"\n\n    We all said something, or looked something, to welcome him, except\n Mrs. Gummidge, who only shook her head over her knitting.\n     \"What's amiss,\" said Mr. Peggotty, with a clap of his hands.\n\" Cheer up, old Mawther ! \" (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.)\n    Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up. She took out\nan old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes ; but instead of putting\ni t in her pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, and still kept it out,\nready for-use.\n    \" What's amiss, dame !\" said Mr. Peggotty.\n    \" Nothing,\" returned Mrs. Gummidge. \"You've come from The\nWrilling Mind, Dan'l P\"\n     \" Why yes, I've took a short spell at The Willing Mind to-night,\" said\nMr. Peggotty.\n     \" I'm sorry I should drive you there,\" said Mrs. Gummidge.\n\n     \" Drive! I don't want no driving,\" returned Mr. Peggotty with an\n\nhonest laugh. \" I only go too ready.\"\n     \" Very ready,\" said nlrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her\neyes. \" Yes, yes, very ready. I am sorry it should be along of me that\nyou 're so ready .\"\n     \" Along o' you? I t an't along o' you ! \" said Mr. Peggotty. \"Don't\nye believe a bit on it.\"\n     \" Yes, yes, it is,\" cried Mrs. Gummidge. \" I know what I am. I\n know that I ' m a lone lorn creetur, and not only that everythink\n goes contrairy with me, but that I go contrairy with everybody. Yes,\nyes. I feel more than other people do, and I show it more. It's my\n misfortun'.\"\n     I really couldn't help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, that the\n misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides\n Mrs. Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort, only answering\n with another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n30            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n    \" I an't what I could wish myself to be,\" said Mrs. Gummidge. \" I\nam far from it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me contrairy.\nI feel my troubles, and they make me contrairy. I wish I did'nt feel 'em,\nbut I do. I wish I could be hardened to 'em, but I an't. I make the\nhouse uncomfortable. I don't wonder at it. I've made your sister so\n all day, and Master Davy.\"\n    Here I was suddenly melted, and roared out \"No, you have'nt, Mrs\nGummidge,\" in great mental distress.\n    \" It's far from right that I should do it,\" said Mrs. Gummidge. \" I t\nan't a fit return. I had better go into the house and die. I am a lone\nlorn creetur, and had much better not make myself contrairy here. If\nthinks must go contrairy with me, and I must go contrairy myself, let me\ngo contrairy in my parish. Dan'l, I'd better go into the house, and.\ndie and be a riddance !\"\n    Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to bed.\nWhen she was gone, Mr. Peggotty, who had not exhibited a trace of any\nfeeling but the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, and nodding\nhis head with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face,\nsaid in a whisper :\n    \" She's been thinking of the old'un !\"\n    I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was\nsupposed to have fixed her mind upon, until Peggotty, on seeing me\nto bed, explained that it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that\nher brother always took that for a received truth on such occasions,\nand that it always had a moving effect upon him. Some time after he\nwas in his hammock that night, I heard him myself repeat to Ham,\n\"Poor thing! She's been thinking of the old 'un!\" And whenever\nMrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder\nof our stay (which happened some few times), he always said the same\nthing in extenuation of the circumstance, and always with the tenderest\ncommiseration.\n    So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of\nthe tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and coming in,\nand altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was unemployed,\nhe sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships, and once or\ntwice he took us for a row. I don't know why one slight set of impres-\nsions should be more particularly associated with a place than another,\nthough I believe this obtains with most people, in reference especially to\nthe associations of their childhood. I never hear the name, or read the\nname, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on\nthe beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly leaning on my shoulder,\nHam lazily dropping stones into the water, and the sun, away at sea,\njust breaking through the heavy mist, and showing us the ships, like\ntheir own shadows.\n    At last the day came for going home. I bore up against the separation\nfrom Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving\nlittle Em'ly was piercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house\nwhere the carrier put up, and I promised, on the road, to write to her.\n(I redeemed that promise afterwards, in characters larger than those in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            31\nwhich apartments are usually announced in manuscript, as being to let).\nWe were greatly overcome at parting ; and if ever, in my life, I have had a\nvoid made in my heart, I had one made that day.\n   Now, all the time I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful to my\nhome again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But I was no\nsooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience seemed\nto point that way with a steady finger; and I felt, all the more for the\nsinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and that my mother was my\ncomforter and friend.\n   This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew,\nand the more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more\nexcited I was to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty,\ninstead of sharing in these transports, tried to check them (though very\nkindly), and looked confused and out of sorts.\n   Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when the\ncarrier's horse pleased-and did. How well I recollect it, on a cold grey\nafternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain !\n   The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my\npleasant agitation, for my mother. I t was not she, but a strange\nservant.\n   \" Why, Peggotty !\" I said, ruefully, \"isn't she come home !\"\n\n   \" Yes, yes, Master Davy,\" said Peggotty. \" She's come home. Wait\na bit, Master Davy, and 1'11-1 1  ' 1 tell you something.\"\n   Between her agitation, and her natural awkwardness in getting out of\nthe cart, Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself, but I\nfelt too blank and strange to tell her so. When she had got down, she\ntook me by the hand ; led me, wondering, into the kitchen; and shut the\ndoor.\n   \" Peggotty ! \" said I, quite frightened.     \"What 's the matter? \"\n   \"Nothing's the matter, bless you, Master D a ~ ydear! \" she answered,\nassuming an air of sprightliness.\n   \" Something 's the matter, I 'm sure. Where's mama? \"\n   \" Where 's mama, Master Davy ? \" repeated Peggotty.\n   \" Yes. Why hasn 't she come out to the gate, and what have we come\nin here for? Oh, Peggotty ! \" My eyes were full, and I felt as if I were\ngoing to tumble down.\n   \"Bless the precious boy ! \" cried Peggotty, taking hold of me. \" What\nis it ? Speak, my pet ! \"\n   \" Not dead, too ! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty ? \"\n   Peggotty cried out No ! with an astonishing volume of voice; and then\nsat down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn.\n   I gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another turn in\nthe right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in anxious\ninquiry.\n   \"You see, dear, I should have told you before now,\" said Peggotty,\n\"but I hadn't an opportunity. I ought to have made it, perhaps, but I\ncouldn't azackly \"-that was always the substitute for exactly, in Peggotty's\nmilitia of words-\" bring my mind to it.\"\n   \" Go on, Peggotty,\" said I, more frightened than before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n32            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n   \"Master Davy,\" said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking\nhand, and speaking in a breathless sort of way. \" What do you think?\nYou have got a P a ! \"\n   I trembled, and turned white. Something-I don't know what, or\nhow-connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising of the\ndead, seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind.\n   \" A new one,\" said Peggotty.\n   \" A new one ?\" I repeated.\n   Peggotty gave a gasp, as if she were swallowing something that was\nvery hard, and, putting out her hand, said :\n   \" Come and see him.\"\n\n   \" I don't want to see him.\"\n   - \"And your mamma,\" said Peggotty.\n   I ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlor, where\nshe left me. On one side of the fire, sat my mother; on the other,\nMr. Murdstone. My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, but\ntimidly I thought.\n   \" Now, Clara my dear,\" said Mr. Murdstone.         \" Recollect ! controul\n\nyourself, always controul yourself! Davy boy, how do you do ? \"\n   I gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed\nmy mother : she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down\nagain to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him, I\nknew quite well that he was looking at us both; and I turned to the\nwindow and looked out there, at some shrubs that were drooping their\nheads in the cold.\n   As soon as I could creep away, I crept up-stairs. My old dear bedroom\nwas changed, and I was to lie a long way off. I rambled down-stairs to\nfind anything that was like itself, so altered it all seemed; and roamed\ninto the yard. I very soon started back from there, for the empty dog-\nkennel was filled up with a great dog-deep mouthed and black-haired\nlike Him-and he was very angry at the sight of me, and sprung out to\nget at me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n  T H E T H E O R Y OF M U S I C A L C O M P O S I T I O N\n           COMPLETELY DEVELOPED,\n                    -                                                          -                       -A-\n\n\n\n\n            Now ready, small 4t0, price 16s., Cloth Gilt, and Key 5s., uniform,\n\nA PRACTICAL TREATISE ON MUSICAL COMPOSITION.\n                            --                         ----*   -   ----            --      -\n         LONDON-LONGMAN,                                       BROWN, GREEN, &amp; LONGMANS.\n                            ---                   --\n                                              - ---        --4-\n\n\n\n\n                   EXTRACTS F R O M O P I N I O N S O F T H E PRESS.\n\nFrom Douglas Jerrold's Weekly New.?paper,16th Dec., 1848.                    knowledge of the subject i t professes t o teach.

W e are the\ncates for better laws and a better tribunal to protect copyright in designs, and for a\nlargely increased extension of copyright. We think the restless demands of the public\nfor constant novelty are alike mischievous to the progress of good ornamental art as\nthey are to all comnlercial interests. W e think that the Schools of Design should be\nreformed and made husiness-like realities. W e shall wage war against all pirates; and\nwe hope to see the day when it will be thought as disgraceful for one manufacturer to\npillage another's patterns as it is held to be if he should walk into the counting-house\nand rob his till. These are some of the points of our political creed, with which we start\non our undertaking. I n conclusion, we profess that our aim is to foster ornamental art in\nall its ways, and to do those things for its advance, in all its branches, which it would be\nthe appropriate business of a Board of Design to do, if such a useful department of\nGovernment actually existed.\n               The following Testimonials, a m o n g others, to the p r a c t i c a l value of t l ~ eWork,\n                                           h a v e been a l r e a d y received :-\n  \"It is matter of surprise t o us, as i t has no doubt         of the subject.

ITis not a little interesting to notice the many recommendatory nouns and adjectives which bear as their\n    initial characters the letters composing the name of MOSES&amp; SON.

and those who desire genuine and cheap Clothing, &amp;c., should\n    call at or send to Minories and Aldgate, City, London ; or to the Branch Establishments as above.\n       TAKENOTICE.--This Establishment is closed from sunset Friday, till sunset Saturday, when business is\n    resumed till 12 o'clock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n74\n\n       BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NIUOLL), there is\n     another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the\n     name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning\n     wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to\n     be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUlNEAS.\n\n\n\n\n        .--\n          The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of\n                              Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.\n        T H E REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Spring Months, with all\n     the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two\n     GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,\n     but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the\n     intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,\n     within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,\n     with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance.

Also,\n\n  GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.\n   These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a\nmuch lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a\nFRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most\nluxurious Bed.\n         T H E EIDER D O W N QUILT,\nalso, is to be seen only at their House.

I went up there, hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the\n way while I climbed the stairs ; and, looking as blank and strange upon the\n room as the room looked upon me, sat down with my small hands crossed,\n and thought.\n     I thought of the oddest things. Of the shape of the room, of the cracks\n in the ceiling, of the paper on the wall, of the flaws in the window-glass\n making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of the washing-stand being\n ricketty on its three legs, and having a discontented something about it,\n which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge under the influence of the old one.\n I was crying all the time, but, except that I was conscious of being cold\n and dejected, I am sure I never thought why I cried. At last in my\n desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little\n Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to come here where no one\n seemed to want me, or to care about me, half as much as she did. This\n made such a very miserable piece of business of it, that I rolled myself up\nin a corner of the counterpane, and cried myself to sleep.\n     I was awoke by somebody saying \" Here he is ! \" and uncovering my\nhot head. My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was\none of them who had done it.\n     uDavy,'y said my mother. \"What 's the matter? \"\n     I thought it very strange that she should ask me, and answered,\n \" Nothing.\" I turned over on my face, I recollect, to hide my trembling\nlip, which answered her with greater truth.\n     \"Davy,\" said my mother. \"Davy, my child !\"\n     I dare say no words she could have uttered, would have affected me so\nmuch, then, as her calling me her child. I hid my tears in the bedclothes,\nand pressed her from me with my hand, when she would have raised\nme up.\n     \"This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!\" said my mother.\n\"1 have no doubt at all about it. How can you reconcile it to your\nconscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against\nanybody who is dear to me? What do you mean by it, Peggotty ? \"\n    Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes, and only answered, in a\nsort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, \"Lord\nforgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and for what you have said this minute,\nmay you never be truly sorry !\"\n    '&lt; It 's enough to distract me,\" cried my mother. \" In my honeymoon,\ntoo, when my most inveterate enemy might relent, one would think, and\nnot envy me a little peace of mind and happiness. Davy, you naughty\nboy ! Peggotty, you savage creature ! Oh, dear me !\" cried my mother,\n                                                              D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n34            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nturning from one of us to the other, in her pettish wilful manner, \"what\na troublesome world this is, when one has the most right to expect it to\nbe as agreeable as possible ! \"\n   I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither her's nor Peggotty's,\nand slipped to my feet at the bed-side. I t was Mr. Murdstone's hand,\nand he kept it on my arm as he said:\n   \"What's this ? Clara, my love, have you forgotten? -Firmness,\nmy dear !\"\n   \"I am very sorry, Edward,\" said my mother. \" I meant to be very\ngood, but I am so uncomfortable.\"\n   \" Indeed ! \" he answered.     \"That's a bad hearing, so soon, Clara.\"\n   \" I say it 's very hard I should be made so now,\" returned my mother,\npouting; \" and it is-very hard-isn't i t ? \"\n   He drew her to him, whispered in her ear, and kissed her. I knew as\nwell, when I saw my mother's head lean down upon his shoulder, and her\narm touch his neck-I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature\ninto any form he chose, as I know, now, that he did it.\n   \" Go you below, my love,\" said Mr. Murdstone. \"David and I will\ncome down, together. My friend,\" turning a darkening face on Peggotty,\nwhen he had watched my mother out, and dismissed her with a nod and a\nsmile : \" do you know your mistress's name ? \"\n   \" She has been my mistress a long time, sir,\" answered Peggotty.        \"I\nought to it.\"\n   \"That's true,\" he answered. \"But I thought I heard you, as I came\nup-stairs, address her by a name that is not hers. She has taken mine, you\nknow. Will you remember that ? \"\n   Peggotty, with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out of the\nroom without replying ; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected to go,\nand had no excuse for remaining. When we two were left alone, he shut the\ndoor, and sitting on a chair, and holding me standing before him, looked\nsteadily into my eyes. I felt my own attracted, no less steadily, to his.\nAs I recall our being opposed thus, face to face, I seem again to hear my\nheart beat fast and high.\n   \"David,\" he said, making his lips thin, by pressing them together,\n\"if I have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with, what do you think\nI do?\"\n   \" I don't know.\"\n\n   \" I beat him.\"\n   I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper, but I felt, in my silence,\nthat my breath was shorter now.\n   \" I make him wince, and smart.      I say to myself, ' I '11 conquer that\nfellow; ' and if it were to cost him all the blood he had, I should do it.\nWhat is that upon your face ? \"\n   \"Dirt,\" I said.\n   H e knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had asked\nthe question twenty times, each time with twenty blows, I believe my baby\nheart would have burst before I would have told him so.\n    \" You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow,\" he said, with\n a grave smile that belonged to him, and you understood me very well, I\n see. Wash that face, sir, and come down with me \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           35\n    He pointed to the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like\nMrs. Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. I\nhad little doubt then, and I have less doubt now, that he would have\nknocked me down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated.\n    \" Clara, my dear,\" he said, when I had done his bidding, and he walked\nme into the parlor, with his hand still on my arm ; \"you will not be made\nuncomfortable any more, I hope. We shall soon improve our youthful\nhumours.\"\n    God help me, I might have been improved for my whole life, I might\nhave been made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind word at that\nseason. A word of encouragement and explanation, of pity for my\nchildish ignorance, of welcome home, of reassurance to me that it was\nhome, might have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth, instead\nof in my hypocritical outside, and might have made me respect instead of\nhate him. I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the\nroom so scared and strange, and that, presently, when I stole to a chair,\nshe followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still-missing, perhaps,\nsome freedom in my childish tread-but the word was not spoken, and\nthe time for it was gone.\n    We dined alone, we three together. He seemed to be very fond of\nmy mother-I am afraid I liked him none the better for that-and she\nwas very fond of him. I gathered from what they said, that an elder\nsister of his was coming to stay with them, and that she was expected\nthat evening. I am not certain whether I found out then, or afterwards,\nthat, without being actively concerned in any business, he had some share\nin, or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant's house in\nLondon, with which his family had been connected from his great-grand-\nfather's time, and in which his sister had a similar interest; but I may\nmention it in this place, whether or no.\n    After dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating\nan escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, lest\nit should offend the master of the house, a coach drove up to the\ngarden-gate, and he went out to receive the visitor. My mother followed\nhim. I was timidly following her, when she turned round at the parlor-\ndoor, in the dusk, and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to\ndo, whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him. She\ndid this hurriedly and secretly, as if it were wrong, but tenderly; and,\nputting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came near to\nwhere he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and drew\nher's through his arm.\n    I t was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady\nshe was ; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in face and\nvoice ; and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her large nose, as\nif, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers, she had\n carried them to that account. She brought with her, two uncompromising\n hard black boxes, with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails.\n When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel\n purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon\n her arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite. I had never, at that\n time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was.\n                                     D 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n94\n\n36            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n   She was brought into the parlor with many tokens of welcome, and\nthere formally recognised my mother as a new and near relation. Then\n she looked at me, and said :\n    cc I s that your boy, sister-in-law ? \"\n   My mother acknowledged me.\n    c c Generally speaking,\" said Miss Murdstone, '&lt; I don't like boys.\n How d' ye do, boy ? \"\n   Under these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very well,\n and that I hoped she was the same; with such an indifferent grace, that\n Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words :\n    '' Wants manner !\"\n   Having uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the favor of\nbeing shewn to her room, which became to me from that time forth a\nplace of awe and dread, wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or\nknown to be left unlocked, and where (for I peeped in once or twice when\nshe was out) numerous little steel fetters and rivets, with which Miss\nMurdstone embellished herself when she was dressed, generally hung\nupon the looking-glass in formidable array.\n   As well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no\nintention of ever going again. She began to \" helpJ' my mother next\nmorning, and was in and out of the store-closet all day, putting things to\nrights, and making havoc in the old arrangements. Almost the first\n remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was, her being constantly\n haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere\n on the premises. Under the influence of this delusion, she dived into the\n coal-cellar at the most untimely hours, and scarcely ever opened the door\n of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again, in the belief that she\n had got him.\n    Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she was a\n perfect Lark in point of getting up. She was up (and, as I believe to this\n hour, looking for that man) before anybody in the house was stirring.\n Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one eye open ;\nbut I could not concur in this idea ; for I tried it myself after hearing the\n suggestion thrown out, and found it couldn't be done.\n   On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her\nbell at cock-crow. When my mother came down to breakfast and was\ngoing to make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the\ncheek, which was her nearest approach to a kiss, and said :\n   \" Now, Clara, my dear, I am come here, you know, to relieve you of all\n\nthe trouble I can. You're much too pretty and thoughtlessJJ-my mother\nblushed but laughed, and seemed not to dislike this character-\" to have\nany duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me. If you'll be\nso good as give me your keys, my dear, 1'11 attend to all this sort of thing\nin future.\"\n   From that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all\nday, and under her pillow all night, and my mother had no more to do\nwith them than I had.\n   My mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a\nshadow of protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing\ncertain household plans to her brother, of which he signified his approba-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n95\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           37\n tion, my mother suddenly began to cry, and said she thought she might\n have been consulted.\n     '&lt; Clara!\" said Mr. Murdstone sternly.     \" Clara ! I wonder at you.\"\n\n      \" Oh, it's very well to say you wonder, Edward !\" cried my mother,\n   and it's very well for you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn't like\nit yourself.\"\n    Firmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both Mr. and\nMiss Murdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed my\n comprehension of it at that time, if I had been called upon, I nevertheless\n did clearly comprehend in my own way, that it was another name for\ntyranny ; and for a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil's humour, that was in\nthem both. The creed, as I should state it now, was this. Mr. Murd-\nstone was firm ; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr. Murdstone ;\nnobody else in his world was to be firm at all, for everybody was to be\nbent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone was an exception. She might be\nfirm, but only by relationship, and in an inferior and tributary degree. My\nmother was another exception. She might be firm, and must be; but\n only in bearing their firmness, and firmly believing there was no other\nfirmness upon earth.\n    \" It's very hard,\" said my mother, \"that in my own house-\"\n\n    \"My own house?\" repeated Mr. Murdstone. \" Clara!\"\n    \" Our own house, I mean,\" faltered my mother, evidently frightened\n-\" I hope you must know what I mean, Edward-it 's very hard that in\nyour own house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters.\nI am sure I managed very well before we were married. There's evi-\ndence,\" said my mother, sobbing ; \" ask Peggotty if I didn't do very well\nwhen I wasn't interfered with !\"\n    \" Edward,\" said Miss Murdstone, \" let there be an end of this. I go\nto-morrow.\"\n    \" Jane Murdstone,\"      said her brother, \"be silent ! How dare you to\ninsinuate that you don't know my character better than your words imply ? \"\n    \" I am sure,\" my poor mother went on, at a grievous disadvantage, and\nwith many tears, \" I don't want anybody to go. I should be very\nmiserable and unhappy if anybody was to go. I don't ask much. I am\nnot unreasonable. I only want to be consulted sometimes. I am very\nmuch obliged to anybody who assists me, and I only want to be consulted\nas a mere form, sometimes. I thought you were pleased, once, with my\nbeing a little inexperienced and girlish, Edward-I am sure you said so-\nbut you seem to hate me for it now, you are so severe.\"\n    \" Edward,\" said Miss Murdstone,-again,- - \" let there be an end of this.\nI go to-moGow.\"\n    c c Jane Murdstone,\" thundered Mr. Murdstone.       \"Will you be silent?\nHow dare you ? \"\n    Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief, and\nheld it before her eyes.\n    \" Clara,\" he continued, looking at my mother, \" you surprise me ! You\n\n astound me ! Yes, I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying an\n inexperienced and artless person, and forming her character, and infusing\n into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it stood in\n need. But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\n              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nin this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition something\nlike a housekeeper's, and when she meets with a base return-\"\n   \" Oh, pray, pray, Edward,\" cried my mother, \" don't accuse me of being\n\nungrateful. I am sure I am not ungrateful. No one ever said I was,\nbefore. I have many faults, but not that. Oh, don't, my dear !\"\n   \"When Jane Murdstone meets, I say,\" he went on, after waiting until\nmy mother was silent, \"with a base return, that feeling of mine is chilled\nand altered.\"\n   \"Don't, my love, say that!\" implored my mother, very piteously.\n\" Oh, don't, Edward ! I can't bear to hear it. Whatever I am, I am\naffectionate. I know I am affectionate. I wouldn't say it, if I wasn't\ncertain that I am. Ask Peggotty. I am sure she '11 tell you I 'm &amp;ec-\ntionate.\"\n   \"There is no extent of mere weakness, Clara,\" said Mr. Murdstone in\nreply, \"that can have the least weight with me. You lose breath.\"\n   \" Pray let us be friends,\" said my mother, \" I couldn't live under\ncoldness or unkindness. I am so sorry. I have a great many defects, I\nknow, and it's very good of you, Edward, with your strength of mind, to\nendeavour to correct them for me. Jane, I don't object to anything.\nI should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving-\"          My\nmother was too much overcome to go on.\n   \" Jane Murdstone,\" said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, \" any harsh words\nbetween us are, I hope, uncommon. I t is not my fault that so unusual an\noccurrence has taken place to-night. I was betrayed into it by another.\nNor is it your fault. You were betrayed into it by another. Let us\nboth try to forget it. And as this,\" he added, after these magnanimous\nwords, \" is not a fit scene for the boy-David, go to bed ! \"\n   I could hardly find the door, through the tears that stood in my eyes.\nI was so sorry for my mother's distress ; but I groped my way out, and\ngroped my way up to my room in the dark, without even having the\nheart to say good night to Peggotty, or to get a candle from her. When\nher coming up to look for me, an hour or so afterwards, awoke me,\n she said that my mother had gone to bedpoorly, and that Mr. and Miss\nMurdstone were sitting alone.\n   Going down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside\nthe parlor-door, on hearing my mother's voice. She was very earnestly\nand humbly entreating Miss Murdstone's pardon, which that lady granted,\nand a perfect reconciliation took place. I never knew my mother after-\nwards to give an opinion on any matter, without first appealing to Miss\nMurdstone, or without having first ascertained, by some sure means, what\nMiss Murdstone's opinion was ; and I never saw Miss Murdstone, when out\nof temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towards her bag as if\nshe were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my\nmother, without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright.\n   The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the\nMurdstone religion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought,\nsince, that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of\nMr. Murdstone's firmness, which wouldn't allow him to let any body off\nfrom the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse\nfor. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous visages with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\nwhich we used to go to church, and the changed air of the place. Again,\nthe dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file into the old pew first,\nlike a guarded captive brought to a condemned service. Again, Miss\nMurdstone, in a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made\nout of a pall, follows close upon me; then my mother; then her\n husband. There is no Peggotty now, as in the old time. Again, I listen\nto Miss Murdstone mumbling the responses, and emphasising all the\n dread words with a cruel relish. Again, I see her dark eyes roll round the\nchurch when she says \"miserable sinners,\" as if she were calling all\nthe congregation names. Again, I catch rare glimpses of my mother,\nmoving her lips timidly between the two, with one of them muttering at\neach ear like low thunder. Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether\nit is likely that our good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and Miss\nMurdstone right, and that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels.\nAgain, if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone\npokes me with her prayer-book, and makes my side ache.\n   Yes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking at my\nmother, and at me, and whispering. Again, as the three go on arm-in-arm,\nand I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, and wonder if my\nmother's step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the gaiety of\nher beauty be really almost worried away. Again, I wonder whether any\nof the neighbours call to mind, as I do, how we used to walk home\ntogether, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that, all the dreary\ndismal day.\n   There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-\nschool. Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had\nof course agreed with them. Nothing, however, was concluded on the\nsubject yet. I n the meantime, I learnt lessons at home.\n   Shall I ever forget those lessons ! They were presided over nominally\nby my mother, but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister, who were always\npresent, and found them a favourable occasion for giving my mother\nlessons in that miscalled firmness, which was the bane of both our lives.\nI believe I was kept at home, for that purpose. I had been apt enough to\nlearn, and willing enough, when my mother and I had lived alone together.\nI can faintly remember learning the alphabet at her knee. To this day,\nwhen I look upon the fat black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty\nof their shapes, and the easy good-nature of 0 and Q and S, seem to\npresent themselves again before me as they used to do. But they recall no\nfeeling of disgust or reluctance. On the contrary, I seem to have walked\nalong a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book, and to have been\ncheered by the gentleness of my mother's voice and manner all the way.\nBut these solemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember as the death-\nblow at my peace, and a grievous daily drudgery and misery. They were\nvery long, very numerous, very hard-perfectly unintelligible, some of\nthem, to me-and I was generally as much bewildered by them as I\nbelieve my poor mother was herself.\n   Let me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back\nagain.\n   I come into the second-best parlor after breakfast, with my books,\nand an exercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for me at her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n98\n\n40             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n writing-desk, but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair by the\n window (though he pretends to be reading a book), or as Miss Murdstone,\n sitting near my mother stringing steel beads. The very sight of these\n two has such an influence over me, that I begin to feel the words I have\n been at infinite pains to get into my head, all sliding away, and going I\n don't know where. I wonder where they do go, by-the-by ?\n     I hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps it is a grammar, perhaps\n a history, or geography. I take a last drowning look at the page as I give\n it into her hand, and start off aloud at a racing pace while I have got it\n fresh. I trip over a word. Mr. Murdstone looks up. I trip over\n another word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden, tumble over half-a-\n dozen words, and stop. I think my mother would show me the book if\nshe dared, but she does not dare, and she says softly :\n    \" Oh, Davy, Davy! \"\n\n    \" Now, Clara,\" says Mr. Murdstone, \"be firm with the boy. Don't\nsay ' Oh, Davy, Davg !' That's childish. He knows his lesson, or he does\nn i t know it.\"\"\n    \" H e does not know it,\" Miss Murdstone interposes awfully.\n    \"I am really afraid he does not,\" says my mother.\n    \"Then you see, Clara,\" returns Miss Murdstone, \"you should just\ngive him the book back, and make him know it.\"\n    \" Yes, certainly,\" says my mother ; \" that is what I intend to do, my\ndear Jane. Now, Davy, try once more, and don't be stupid.\"\n    I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, but am\nnot so successful with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble down\nbefore I get to the old place, at a point where I was all right before, and\n stop to think. But I can't think about the lesson. I think of the\nnumber of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's cap, or of the price of\nMr. Murdstone's dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem that I\nhave no business with, and don't want to have anything at all to do with.\nMr. Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been\nexpecting for a long time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My mother\nglances submissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear\nto be worked out when my other tasks are done.\n    There is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling\nsnowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so\nhopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that I\ngive up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The\ndespairing way in which my mother and I look at each other, as I blunder\non, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect in these miserable lessons\nis when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries to give me\nthe cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss Murdstone, who has\nbeen lying in wait for nothing else all along, says in a deep warning voice :\n    '' Clara ! \"\n    My mother starts, colors, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes\nout of his chair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes my ears with\nit, and turns me out of the room by the shoulders.\n    Even when the lessons are done, the worst is yet to happen, in the shape\nof an appalling sum. This is invented for me, and delivered to me\norally by Mr. Murdstone, and begins, \" I f I go into a cheesemonger's\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\nshop, and buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-\nhalfpenny each, present payment \"-at          which I see Miss Murdstone\nsecretly overjoyed. I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlighten-\nment until dinner-time ; when, having made a Mulatto of myself by getting\nthe dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin, I have a slice of bread to\nhelp me out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace for the rest\nof the evening.\n    I t seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies\ngenerally took this course. I could have done very well if I had been without\nthe Murdstones ;but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the\nfascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird. Even when I did get\nthrough the morning with tolerable credit, there was not much gained but\ndinner; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me untasked, and\nif I rashly made any show of being unemployed, called her brother's\nattention to me by saying, \" Clara, my dear, there's nothing like work-\ngive your boy an exercise;\" which caused me to be clapped down to some\nnew labor, there and then. As to any recreation with other children of\nmy age, I had very little of that; for the gloomy theology of the\nMurdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers (though\nthere was a child once set in the midst of the Disciples), and held that\nthey contaminated one another.\n   The natural result of this treatment, continued, I suppose, for some six\nmonths or more, was to make me sullen, dull, and dogged. I was not\nmade the less so, by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and\nalienated from my mother. I believe I should have been almost stupified\nbut for one circumstance.\n   I t was this. My father had left a small collection of books in a little room\nup-stairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my own) and which nobody\nelse in our house ever troubled. From that blessed little room, Roderick\nRandom, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, The Vicar of\nWakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and RobinsonCrusoe, came out, a glorious\nhost, to keep me company. They kept alive my fancy, and my hope of some-\nthing beyond that place and time,-they, and the Arabian Nights, and the\nTales of the Genii,-and did me no harm ; for whatever harm was in some\nof them was not there for me ;I knew nothing of it. It is astonishing to\nme now, how I found time, in the midst of my porings and blunderings\n over heavier themes, to read those books as I did. I t is curious to me\n how I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles (which\n were great troubles to me), by impersonating my favorite characters in\n them-as I did-and by putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone into all the bad\n ones-which I did too. I have been Tom Jones (a child's Tom Jones,\n a harmless creature) for a week together. I have sustained my own idea\n of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I verily believe. I had a\n greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and Travels-I forget what,\n now-that were on those shelves ; and for days and days I can remember\n to have gone about my region of our house, armed with the centre-piece\nout of an old set of boot-trees-the perfect realisation of Captain Somebody,\n of the Royal British Navy, in danger of being beset by savages, and\nresolved to sell his life at a great price. The Captain never lost dignity,\nfrom having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar. I did ; but the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n42            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n Captain was a Captain and a hero, in despite of all the grammars of all\n the languages in the world, dead or alive.\n    This was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, the\n picture always rises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys at play in\n the churchyard, and I sitting onmy bed, reading as if for life. Every barn\nin the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every foot of the\n churchyard, had some association of its own, in my mind, connected with\n these books, and stood for some locality made famous in them. I have\n seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple ; I have watched Strap,\nwith the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest himself upon the wicket-\ngate; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club with\nMr. Pickle, in the parlor of our little village alehouse.\n    The reader now understands as well as I do, what I was when I came\nto that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again.\n   One morning when I went into the parlor with my books, I found\nmy mother looking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr.\nMurdstone binding something round the bottom of a cane-a lithe and\nlimber cane, which he left off binding when I came in, and poised and\nswitched in the air.\n   \" I tell you, Clara,\" said Mr. Murdstone, \"I have been often flogged\nmyself.\"\n   \" To be sure ; of course,\" said Miss Murdstone.\n    \" Certainly, my dear Jane,\" faltered my mother, meekly. \" But-but\ndo you think it did Edward good ?\"\n    \"Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?\" asked Mr. Murdstone,\ngravely.\n    \"That's the point !\" said his sister.\n   T o this my mother returned, \"Certainly, my dear Jane,\" and saidno more.\n    I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue,\nand sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine.\n    \"Now, David,\" he said-and I saw that cast again, as he saidit-\" you\nmust be far more careful to-day than usual.\" H e gave the cane another\npoise, and another switch; and having finished his preparation of it, laid it\ndown beside him, with an expressive look, and took up his book.\n   This was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning. I\nfelt the words of my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or line by line,\nbut by the entire page. I tried to lay hold of them ;but they seemed, if I\nmay so express it, to have put skates on, and to skim away from me with a\nsmoothness there was no checking.\n   We began badly, and went on worse. I had come in, with an idea of\ndistinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared ;\nbut it turned out to be quite a mistake. Book after book was added to\nthe heap of failures, Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the\ntime. And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses (canes he\nmade it that day, I remember), my mother burst out crying.\n    \" Clara ! \" said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice.\n    \" I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think,\" said my mother.\n   I saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he rose and said, taking up\nthe cane :\n    \"Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect firmness,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n101\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          43\nthe worry and torment that David has occasioned her to-day. That\nwould be stoical. Clara is greatly strengthened and improved, but we\ncan hardly expect so much from her. David, you and I will go up-stairs,\nboy.\"\n   As he took me out at the door, my mother ran towards us. Miss\n3Iurdstone said, \" Clara ! are you a perfect fool ? \" and interfered. I saw\nmy mother stop her ears then, and I heard her crying.\n   H e walked me up to my room slowly and gravely-I am certain he\nhad a delight in that formal parade of executing justice-and when we\ngot there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.\n   \" Mr. Murdstone ! Sir !\" I cried to him.     \"Don't ! Pray don't beat\nme ! I have tried to learn, sir, but I ean't learn while you and Miss\nMurdstone are by. I ean't indeed ! \"\n   \" Can't you, indeed, David?\" he said. \" We 1' 1 try that.\"\n   H e had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and\nstopped him for a moment, entreating him not to beat me. I t was only\nfor a moment that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant\nafterwards, and in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held\nme in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit it through. I t sets my teeth\non edge to think of it.\n   He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death. Above all\nthe noise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying out-\nI heard my mother crying out-and Peggotty. Then he was gone ; and\nthe door was locked outside ; and I was lying, fevered and hot, and torn,\nand sore, and raging in my puny way, upon the floor.\n   How well I recollect, when I became quiet, what an unnatural stillness\nseemed to reign through the whole house ! How well I remember, when\nmy smart and passion began to cool, how wicked I began to feel !\n   I sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. I crawled\nup from the floor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and ugly,\nthat it almost frightened me. My stripes were sore and stiff, and made me\ncry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I felt. I t\nlay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal, I\ndare say.\n   I t had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (Ihad been lying,\nfor the most part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing,\nand looking listlessly out), when the key was turned, and Miss Murdstone\ncame in with some bread and meat, and milk. These she put down upon\nthe table without a word, glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness,\nand then retired, locking the door after her.\n   Long after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else\nwould come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed,\nand went to bed ; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully what would be\n done to me. Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed?\nWhether I should be taken into custody, and sent to prison? Whether\nI was at all in danger of being hanged?\n   I never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and\nfresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale\nand dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared\nbefore I was out of bed; told me, in so many words, that I was free to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n44            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nwalk in the garden for half an hour and no longer ; and retired, leaving\nthe door open, that I might avail myself of that permission.\n    I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted\nfive days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone\n down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one,\nMiss Murdstone excepted, during the whole time-except at evening\nprayers in the parlor; to which I was escorted by Miss &amp;turdstone after\n everybody else was placed; where I was stationed, a young outlaw, all\n alone by myself near the door; and whence I was solemnly conducted by\nmy jailer, before anyone arose from the devotional posture. I only\n observed that my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept\nher face another way so that I never saw it; and that Mr. $turdstone's\nhand was bound up in a large linen wrapper.\n    The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one.\nThey occupy the place of years in my remembrance. The way in which\nI listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible\nto me; the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the\nmurmuring of voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to any laughing,\nwhistling, or singing, outside, which seemed more dismal than anything\nelse to me in my solitude and disgrace-the uncertain pace of the hours,\nespecially at night, when I would wake thinking it was morning, and\nfind that the family were not yet gone to bed, and that all the length of\nnight had yet to come-the depressed dreams and nightmares I had-the\nreturn of day, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the\nchurchyard, and I watched them from a distance within the room, being\nashamed to show myself at the window lest they should know I was a\nprisoner-the       strange sensation of never hearing myself speak-the\nfleeting intervals of something like cheerfulness, which came with eating\nand drinking, and went away with it-the setting in of rain one evening,\nwith a fresh smell, and its coming down faster and faster between me\nand the church, until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in\ngloom, and fear, and remorse-all this appears to have gone round and\nround for years instead of days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on\nmy remembrance.\n    On the last night of my restraint, I was awakened by hearing my own\nname spoken in a whisper. I started up in bed, and putting out my arms\nin the dark, said :\n    \" I s that you, Peggotty ? \"\n   There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again,\nin a tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone\ninto a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the\nkeyhole.\n    I groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole,\nwhispered :\n    \" I s that you, Peggotty, dear?\"\n    \"Yes, my own precious Davy,\" she replied. \"Be as soft as a mouse,\nor the Cat '11 hear us.\"\n   I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the\nurgency of the case ; her room being close by.\n    \" How's mama, dear Peggotty ?       Is she very angry with me? \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n103\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            45\n     I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, as I was\ndoing on mine, before she answered. \"No. Not very.\"\n     \" What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear ?      Do you know ? \"\n     \" School. Near London,\" was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to get\nher to repeat it, for she spoke it the f i s t time quite down my throat, in\nconsequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the key-\nhole and put my ear there ; and though her words tickled me a good deal,\nI didn't hear them.\n     cr When, Peggotty ? \"\n      \" TO-morrow.\"\n\n     \"Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my\ndrawers ?\" which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention it.\n     \" Yes,\" said Peggotty. \" Box.\"\n     \" Shan't I see mama ? \"\n     \" Yes,\" said Peggotty. \" Morning.\"\n     Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole, and delivered these\nwords through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has\never been the medium of communicating, I will venture to assert : shoot-\ning in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own.\n     \" Davy, dear.   If I ain't ben azackly as intimate with you. Lately, as I\nused to be. I t ain't becase I don't love you. Just as well and more, my\npretty poppet. It's because I thought it better for you. And for some one\nelse besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening ? Can you hear ? \"\n     \" Ye-ye-ye-yes,       Peggotty !\" I sobbed.\n     \" My own !\" said Peggotty, with infinite compassion. \" What I want\nto say, is. That you must never forget me. For I 1' 1 never forget you. And\nI 1' 1 take as much care of your mama, Davy. As ever I took of you. And I\nwon't leave her. The day may come when she '11 be glad to lay her poor\nhead. On her stupid, cross old Peggotty's arm again. And I'll write to\nyou, my dear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I 'll-I 'll-\"            Peggotty\nfell to kissing the keyhole, as she couldn't kiss me.\n     \"Thank you, dear Peggotty !\" said I. &lt;' Oh, thank you ! Thank\nyou ! Will you promise me one thing, Peggotty ? Will you write and\ntell Mr. Peggotty and little Em'ly and &amp;s. Gummidge and Ham, that\nI am not so bad as they might suppose, and that I sent 'em all my love-\nespecially to little Em'ly ? Will you, if you please, Peggotty ?\"\n     The kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the\ngreatest affection-I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had been\nher honest face-and parted. From that night there grew up in my\nbreast, a feeling for Peggotty, which I cannot very well define. She did\nnot replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into a\nvacancy in my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards her some-\nthing I have never felt for any other human being. I t was a sort of comical\naffection too ; and yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should have\ndone, or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been\nto me.\n     I n the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was\ngoing to school; which was not altogether such news to me as she\nsupposed. She also informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come\ndown-stairs into the parlor, and have my breakfast. There, I found my\n\n\n\n\n\n\n104\n\n              THX PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nmother, very pale and with red eyes : into whose arms I ran, and begged\nher pardon from my suffering soul.\n  c c Oh, Davy !\" she said. \" That you could hurt any one I love ! Try to\nbe better, pray to be better ! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, Davy,\nthat you should have such bad passions in your heart.\"\n   They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was more\nsorry for that, than for my going away. I felt it sorely. I tried to eat\nmy parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter,\nand trickled into my tea. I saw my mother look at me sometimes,\nand then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and then look down, or\nlook away.\n   \" Master Copperfield's box there !\" said Miss Murdstone, when wheels\n\nwere heard at the gate.\n   I looked for Peggotty, but it was not she ; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone\nappeared. My former acquaintance, the carrier, was at the door; the\nbox was taken out to his cart, and lifted in.\n   \" Clara ! \" said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note.\n\n   \"Ready, my dear Jane,\" returned my mother. \" Good bye, Davy.\nYou are going for your own good. Good bye, my child. You will come\nhome in the holidays, and be a better boy.\"\n   \" Clara !\" Miss Murdstone repeated.\n   \" Certainly, my dear Jane,\" replied my mother, who was holding me.\n\n\" I forgive you, my dear boy.     God bless you ! \"\n   \" Clara ! \" Miss Murdstone repeated.\n\n   Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to\nsay on the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad\nend; and then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER V.\n                     I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME.\n  WE might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was\nquite wet through, when the carrier stopped short.\n  Looking out to ascertain what for, I saw, to my amazement, Peggotty\nburst from a hedge and climb into the cart. She took me in both her\narms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was\nextremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I\nfound it very tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing\none of her arms, she put it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought\nout some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a\npurse which she put into my hand, but not one word did she say. After\nanother and a final squeeze with both arms, she got down from the cart\nand ran away; and, my belief is, and has always been, without a solitary\nbutton on her gown. I picked up one, of several that were rolling about,\nand treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.\n   The carrier looked at me, as if to enquire if she were coming back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n105\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\nI shook my head, and said I thought not. \"Then come up,\" said the\ncarrier to the lazy horse ; who came up accordingly.\n   Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think\nit was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random,\nnor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I could\nremember, in trying situations. The carrier, seeing me in this resolution,\nproposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon the horse's\nback to dry. I thanked him, and assented; and particularly small it\nlooked, under those circumstances.\n   I had now leisure to examine the purse. I t was a stiff leather\npurse, with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty\nhad evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight. But\nits most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit of\npaper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, \"For Davy. With my\nlove.\" I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good\nas reach me my pocket-handkerchief again ; but he said he thought I had\nbetter do without it ; and I thought I really had ; so I wiped my eyes\non my sleeve and stopped myself.\n   For good, too ; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was\nstill occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for\nsome little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way.\n   \" All the way where ? \" enquired the carrier.\n   \"There,\" I said.\n   \"Where 's there ? \" enquired the carrier.\n   \" Near London ? \" I said.\n   \"Why that horse,\" said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out,\n\"would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground.\"\n   \" Are you only going to Yarmouth then ? \" I asked.\n\n   \" That's about it, \" said the carrier. \" And there I shall take you to\nthe stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that 1' 1 take you to-wherever it is. \"\n   As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis)\nto say-he     being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic\ntemperament, and not at all conversational-I offered him a cake as a\nmark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant, and\nwhich made no more impression on his big face than it would have done\non an elephant's.\n   \" Did she make 'em, now ? \" said Xlr. Barkis, always leaning forward,\n\nin his slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each\nknee.\n   \" Peggotty, do you mean, sir ? \"\n    \" Ah ! \" said Mr. Barkis.      Her. \"\n    \" Yes.   She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking. \"\n    \" Do she though? \" said Mr. Barkis.\n   H e made up his mouth as if to whistle, but he didn't whistle. H e sat\nlooking at the horse's ears, as if he saw something new there ;and sat so,\nfor a considerable time. By-and-by, he said :\n   \" NO sweethearts, I b'lieve ? \"\n   \" Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis? \" For I thought he wanted\nsomething else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of\nrefreshment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106\n\n48             THE PERSONAL HISTORY ATID EXPERIENCE\n\n  \" Hearts, \" said Mr.Barkis. \" Sweet hearts; no person walks with her !\"\n  \" With Peggotty ? \"\n\n  \" Ah !\" he said. \" Her. \"\n  \" Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart. \"\n  \" Didn't she though ! \" said Mr. Barkis.\n    Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle,\nbut sat looking at the horse's ears.\n     \" So she makes,\" said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection,\n\" all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she ? \"\n    I replied that such was the fact.\n    \" Well.    I'll tell yon what, \" said Mr. Barkis. \" P'raps you might be\nwritin' to her ? \"\n    \" I shall certainly write to her, \" I rejoined.\n\n    \" Ah ! \" he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. \" Well ! If you\nwas writin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin' ;\nwould YOU. \"\n    \" That Barkis is willing, \" I repeated, innocently.     \" I s that all the\nmessage ? \"\n    \" Ye-es, \" he said, considering. \" Ye-es.         Barkis is willin'. \"\n    cr But you will be at Blunderstone again to-morrow, Mr. Barkis, \" I\nsaid, faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, \" and\ncould give your own message so much better. \"\n    As he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his head, and\nonce more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound gravity,\nc r Barkis is willin'.      That's the message,\" I readily undertook its\ntransmission. While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel at Yarmouth\nthat very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paper and an inkstand, and\nwrote a note to Peggotty which ran thus : \" My dear Peggotty. I have\ncome here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama. Yours aEec-\ntionately. P. S. H e says he particularly wants you to know-Barkis is\nwilling. \"\n    When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis\nrelapsed into perfect silence ;and I, feeling quite worn out by all that had\nhappened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I slept\nsoundly until we got to Yarmouth ;which was so entirely new and strange\nto me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once abandoned a\nlatent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty's family\nthere, perhaps even with little Enl'ly herself.\n    The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without\nany horses to i t as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more\nunlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking this, and\nwondering what would ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis\nhad put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up\nthe yard to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately become of me,\nwhen a lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of\nmeat were hanging up, and said :\n     \" Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone? \"\n     \"Yes, ma'am,\" I said.\n     \"What name ? \" enquired the lady.\n     \" Copperfield, ma'am,\" I said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n107\n\n                         O F DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\n    \"That won't do,\" returned the lady. \" Nobody's dinner is paid for\n here, in that name.\"\n    \" I s it Murdstone, ma'am 3 \" I said.\n\n    \" If you're Master Murdstone,\" said the lady, \"why do you go and\n\n give another name, first ? \"\n    I explained to the lady how it was, who then rang a bell, and called\n out, \"William ! show the coffee-room ! \" upon which a waiter came\nrunning out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it,\nand seemed a good deal surprised when he found he was only to show\nit to me.\n    I t was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I\n could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries,\n and I cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to\n sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the\n door; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set\nof castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty.\n    H e brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in\nsuch a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some\n offence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at\nthe table, and saying, very affably, \" Now, six-foot ! come on ! \"\n    I thanked him, and took my seat at the board ; but found it extremely\ndifficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity,\nor to avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing\nopposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful\nmanner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second\nchop, he said :\n    \" There's half a pint of ale for you.  Will you have it now ? \"\n    I thanked him, and said \"Yes.\" Upon which he poured it out of a jug into\na large tumbler, and held it up against the light, andmade it look beautiful.\n    \" My eye ! \" he said. \" I t seems a good deal, don't i t ? \"\n    \" I t does seem a good deal,\" I answered with a smile.    For it was quite\ndelightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed, pimple-\nfaced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and as he\nstood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with the\nother hand, he looked quite friendly.\n    \" There was a gentleman here, yesterday,\" he said-\"    a stout gentleman,\nby the name of Topsawyer-perhaps you know him!\"\n    \" No,\" I said, \" I don't think-\"\n    \" I n breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled\nchoaker,\" said the waiter.\n    \"No,\" I said bashfully, \"I haven't the pleasure-\"\n    \" He came in here,\" said the waiter, looking at the light through the\n\ntumbler, \" ordered a glass of this ale-would order it-I told him not-\ndrank it, and fell dead. I t was too old for him. I t oughtn't to be\ndrawn ; that 's the fact.\"\n    I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said\nI thought I had better have some water.\n    \"Why you see,\" said the waiter, still looking at the light through the\ntumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, \" our people don't like things being\nordered and left. I t offends 'em. But I ' l l drink it, if you like. I'm\n                                                                 E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n108\n\n50             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nused to it, and use is everything. I don't think it '11 hurt me, if I throw\nmy head back, and take it off quick. Shall I ? \"\n   I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought he\ncould do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his\nhead back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess, of seeing\nhim meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall lifeless on the\ncarpet. But it didn't hurt him. On the contrary, I thought he seemed\nthe fresher for it.\n   \" What have we got here ? \" he said, putting a fork into my dish. \" Not\nchops ? \"\n   \" Chops,\" I said.\n\n   \"Lord bless my soul ! \" he exclaimed, \"I didn't know they were chops.\nWhy, a chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer !\nAin't it lucky 2 \"\n   So he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the other,\nand ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction. H e\nafterwards took another chop, and another potato ; and after that, another\nchop and another potato. When we had done, he brought me a pudding,\nand having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent i n\nhis mind for some moments.\n   \"How's the pie? \" he said, rousing himself.\n   \" It's a pudding,\" I made answer.\n   \"Pudding ! \" he exclaimed. \" Why, bless me, so it is ! What ! \"\nlooking at it nearer. \"You don't mean to say i t 's a batter-pudding ! \"\n   'I Yes, it is indeed.\"\n\n   \"Why, a batter-pudding,\" he said, taking up a table-spoon, ''$ my\nfavorite pudding! Ain't that lucky ? Come on, little 'un, and let s see\nwho 'll get most.\"\n   The waiter certainly got most. H e entreated me more than once to\n come in and win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his\ndispatch to my dispatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I was left far\nbehind at the first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw\nany one enjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was\nall gone, as if his enjoyment of it lasted still.\n   Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I\nasked for the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty. He not only\nbrought it immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I\nwrote the letter. When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going\nto school.\n   I said, \"Near London,\" which was all I knew.\n   \" Oh, my eye !\" he said, looking very low-spirited, \" I am sorry for that.\"\n   \" Why ?\" I asked him.\n   \" Oh, Lord ! \" he said, shaking his head, \" that's the school where they\nbroke the boy's ribs-two ribs-a little boy he was. I should say he\nwas-let me see-how old are you, about?\"\n   I told him between eight and nine.\n   \" That's just his age,\" he said. \" H e was eight years and six months\nold when they broke his first rib ; eight years and eight months old when\nthey broke his second, and did for him.\"\n   I could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this was an\n\n\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            51\nuncomfortable coincidence, and enquired how it was done. His answer was\nnot cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, \"With\nwhopping.\"\n   The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion,\nwhich made me get up and hesitatingly enquire, in the mingled pride and\ndiffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there\nwere anything to pay.\n   \"There's a sheet of letter-paper,\" he returned. \" Did you ever buy a\nsheet of letter-paper ? \"\n   I could not remember that I ever had.\n   \"It 'S dear,\" he said, \" on account of the duty. Threepence. That's\nthe way we're taxed in this country. There's nothing else, except the\nwaiter. Never mind the ink. I l o s e by that.''\n   .'What should you-what should I-how much ought I to-what\nwould i t be right to pay the waiter, if you please? \" I stammered, blushing.\n   \"If I hadn't a family, and that family hadn't the cowpock,\" said the\nwaiter, \"I wouldn't take a sixpence. If I didn't support a aged pairint,\nand a lovely sister,\"-here the waiter was greatly agitated-\" I wouldn't\ntake a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated well here, I should\nbeg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking of it. But I live on broken\nwittles-and I sleep on the coals \"-here the waiter burst into tears.\n   I was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that any recog-\nnition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart.\nTherefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he received\nwith much humility and veneration, and spun up with his thumb, directly\nafterwards, to try the goodness of.\n   I t was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up\nbehind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without\nany assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in the bow-\nwindow, say to the guard, \"Take care of that child, George, or he 1' 1\nburst ! \" and from observing that the women-servants who were about the\nplace came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon. My\nunfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite recovered his spirits, did not\nappear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admiration\nwithout being at all confused. If I had any doubt of him, I suppose this\nhalf-awakened it ; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple con-\nfidence of a child, and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years\n(qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for\nworldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole,\neven then.\n   I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it, the\nsubject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing\nheavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and as to the greater expe-\ndiency of my travelling by waggon. The story of my supposed appetite\ngetting wind among the outside passengers, they were merry upon it\nlikewise ;and asked me whether I was going to be paid for, at school, as two\nbrothers or three, and whether I was contracted for, or went upon the\nregular terms; with other pleasant questions. But the worst of it\nwas, that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything, when an oppor-\ntunity offered, and that, after a rather light dinner, I should remain hungry\n                                      E 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n110\n\n.J   2        THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nall night-for I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My\napprehensions were realised. When we stopped for supper I couldn't\nmuster courage to take any, though I should have liked it very much, but\nsat by the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did not save me\nfrom more jokes, either ; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face,\nwho had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way, except\nwhen he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I was like a boa\nconstrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time ; after\nwhich, he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef.\n    We had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, and\nwe were due in London about eight next morning. I t was Midsummer\nweather, and the evening was very pleasant. When we passed through a\nvillage, I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like, and\nwhat the inhabitants were about; and when boys came running after us,\nand got up behind and swung there for a little way, I wondered whether\ntheir fathers were alive, and whether they were happy at home. I had plenty\nto think of, therefore, besides my mind running continually on the kind of\nplace I was going to-which was an awful speculation. Sometimes,I remem-\nber, I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty ; and to endeavour-\ning, in a confused blind way, to recall how I had felt, and what sort of boy\nI used to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone : which I couldn't satisfy myself\nabout by any means, I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity.\n    The night was not so pleasant as the evening, for it got chilly; and\nbeing put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) to\n prevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by their\n falling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard\n sometimes, that I could not help crying out, \" Oh ! If you please ! \"\n -which they didn't like at all, because it woke them. Opposite me was\n an elderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked in the dark more like a\n haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady\n had a basket with her, and she hadn't known what to do with it, for a\n long time, until she found that on account of my legs being short, it could\n go underneath me. I t cramped and hurt me so, that it made me per-\n fectly miserable ; but if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was\n in the basket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave\n me the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, '&lt; Come, don't you fidget.\n Yow bones are young enough, I ' m sure! \"\n    At last the sun rose, and then my companions seemed to sleep easier.\n The difficulties under which they had laboured all night, and which had\n found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts, are not to be con-\n ceived. As the sun got higher, their sleep became lighter, and so they\n gradually one by one awoke. I recollect being very much surprised by\n the feint everybody made, then, of not having been to sleep at all, and by\n the uncommon indignation with which every one repelled the charge. I\n labor under the same kind of astonishment to this day, having invariably\n observed that of all human weaknesses, the one to which our common\n nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine why) is the\n weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach.\n    What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance,\n and how I believed all the adventures of all my favorite heroes to be\n  constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            55\nin my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities\nof the earth, I need not stop here to relate. We approached it by degrees,\nand got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district, for which we\nwere bound. I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or the Blue Boar ;\nbut I know it was the Blue Something, and that its likeness was painted\nup on the back of the coach.\n   The guard's eye lighted on me as he was getting down, and he said at\nthe booking-office door :\n    \" I s there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of &amp; h d -\n\nstone, from BIoonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called for ?\"\n   Nobody answered.\n    \" Try Copperfield, if you please, sir,\" said I, looking helplessly down.\n\n    \" I s there anybody here for a yoongster, booked in the name of Murd-\nstone,from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name of Copperfield,\nto be left till called for ?\" said the guard. \" Come ! 1s there anybody?\"\n   No. There was nobody. I looked anxiously around; but the enquiry\nmade no impression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in gaiters,\nwith one eye, who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round\nmy neck, and tie me up in the stable.\n   A ladder was brought, and I got down after the lady, who was like a\nhaystack : fiot daring to stir, until her basket was removed. The coach\nwas clear of passengers by that time, the luggage was very soon cleared\nout, the horses had been taken out before the luggage, and now the coach\nitself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out of the way. Still,\nnobody appeared, to claim the dusty youngster fromBlunderstone, Suffolk.\n   More solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had nobody to look at him\nand see that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, and, by invita-\ntion of the clerk on duty, passed behind the counter, and sat down on the\nscale at which they weighed the luggage. Here, as I sat looking at the\nparcels, packages, and books, and inhaling the smell of stables (ever since\nassociated with that morning), a procession of most tremendous considera-\ntions began to march through my mind. Supposing nobody should ever\nfetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there? Would they\nkeep me long enough to spend seven shillings ? Should I sleep at night\nin one of those wooden binns with the other luggage, and wash myself at\nthe pump in the yard in the morning; or should I be turned out every\nnight, and expected to come again to be left till called for, when the office\nopened next day ? Supposing there was no mistake in the case, and Mr.\nMurdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me, what should I do ? If\nthey allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings were spent, I\ncouldn't hope to remain there when I began to starve. That would obviously\nbe inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, besides entailing on the\nBlue Whatever-it-was, the risk of funeral expenses. If I started off at\nonce, and tried to walk back home, how could I ever find my way, how\ncould I ever hope to walk so far, how could I make sure of any one but\nPeggotty, even if I got back ? If I found out the nearest proper authori-\nties, and offered myself to go for a soldier, or a sailor, I was such a little\nfellow that it was most likely they wouldn't take me in. These thoughts,\nand a hundred other such thoughts, turned me burning hot, and made me\ngiddy with apprehension and dismay. I was in the height of my fever\n\n\n\n\n\n\n112\n\n54             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\n when a man entered and whispered to the clerk, who presently slanted me\n off the scale, and pushed me over to him, as if I were weighed, bought,\n delivered, and paid for.\n    As I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance,\n I stole a look at him. He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow\n cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr, Mnrdstone's; but there the\n likeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, instead of\n being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressed in a suit of black clothes\n which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short in the sleeves and\n legs ; and he had a white neck-kerchief on that was not over-clean. I did\n not, and do not, suppose that this neck-kerchief was all the linen he wore,\n but it was all he showed or gave any hint of.\n    \" You 're the new boy ? \" he said.\n\n    \" Yes, sir,\" I said.\n    I supposed I was. I didn't know.\n    \"I 'm one of the masters at Salem House,\" he said.\n    I made him a bow and felt very much overawed. I was so ashamed to\nallude to a common-place thing like my box, to a scholar and a master at\nSalem House, that we had gone some little distance from the yard before\nI had the hardihood to mention it. We turned back, on my humbly\ninsinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter ; and he told the clerk\nthat the carrier had instructions to call for it at noon.\n    \" If you please, sir,\" I said, when we had accomplished about the same\ndistance as before, \" is it far ? \"\n    \" It's down by Blackheath,\" he said.\n    \"Is that far, sir ? \" I diffidently asked.\n    \"It's a good step,\" he said. \"We shall go by the stage-coach. I t ' s\nabout six miles.\"\n    I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles more,\nwas too much for me. I took heart to tell him that I had had nothing all\nnight, and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat, I should be\nvery much obliged to him. He appeared surprised at this-I see him stop\nand look at me now-and after considering for a few moments, said he\nwanted to call on an old person who lived not far 08,and that the best\nway would be for me to buy some bread, or whatever I liked best that was\n.rvholesome, and make my breakfast at her house, where we could get\nsome milk.\n    Accordingly ure looked in at a baker's window, and after I had made a\nseries of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and lie\nhad rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of\nbrown bread, which cost me threepence. Then, at a grocer's shop, we\nbought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon ; which still left what I thought\na good deal of change, out of the second of the bright shillings, and made\nme consider London a very cheap place. These provisions laid in, we went\non through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond\ndescription, and over a bridge which, no doubt, was London Bridge\n(indeed I think he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to the\npoor person's house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew by\ntheir look, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate, which said they\nwere established for twenty-five poor women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n113\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\n   The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little\nblack doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned\nwindow on one side, and another little diamond-paned window above ;\nand we went into the little house of one of these poor old women, who was\nblowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil. On seeing the master enter, the\nold woman stopped with the bellows on her knee, and said something that\nI thought sounded like \"My Charley ! \" but on seeing me come in too,\nshe got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey.\n   \" Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you please? \"\nsaid the Master at Salem House.\n   \" Can I ?\" said the old woman. \" Yes can I , sure !\"\n   \" How's Mrs. Fibbitson to-day ?\" said the Master, looldng at another\nold woman in a large chair by the fire, who was such a bundle of clothes\nthat I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake.\n   \" Ah, she's poorly,\"      said the first old woman. \" I t 's one of her\nbad days. If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe\nshe 'd go out too, and never come to life again.\"\n   As they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was a warm\nday, she seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied she was jealous\neven of the saucepan on it ; and I have reason to know that she took its\nimpressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in\ndudgeon; for I saw her, withmy own discomfited eyes, shake her fist at me\nonce, when those culinary operations were going on, and no one else was\nlooking. The sun streamed in at the little window, but she sat with her\nown back and the back of the large chair towards it, screening the fire as if\nshe were sedulously keeping it warm, instead of it keeping her warm, and\nwatching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion of the prepara-\ntions for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her such extreme joy that\nshe laughed aloud-and a very unmelodious laugh she had, I must say.\n   I sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, with a\nbason of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal. While I was yet\nin the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house said to the Master :\n   \" Have you got your flute with you?\"\n   \" Yes,\" he returned.\n   \" Have a blow at it,\" said the old woman, coaxingly. \"Do !\"\n   The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat,\nand brought out his flute in three pieces, which he screwed together, and\nbegan immediately to play. My impression is, after many years of con-\nsideration, that there never can have been anybody in the worId who\nplayed worse. H e made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard pro-\nduced by any means, natural or artificial. I don't know what the tunes\nwere-if there were such things in the performance at all, which I doubt\n-but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make me think of\nall my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back; then to take\naway my appetite; and lastly to make me so sleepy that I couldn't keep\nmy eyes open. They begin to close again, and I begin to nod, as the\nrecollection rises fresh upon me. Once more the little room with its\nopen corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and its angular little\nstaircase leading to the room above, and its three peacock's feathers dis-\nplayed over the mantelpiece-I remember wondering when I first went in,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n56            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nwhat that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery\nwas doonied to come to-fades from before me, and I nod, and sleep.\nThe flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard instead,\nand I am on my journey. The coach jolts, I wake with a start, and the\nflute has come back again, and the Master at Salem House is sitting with\nhis legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old woman of the house\nlooks on delighted. She fades in her turn, and he fades, and all fades,\nand there is no flute, no Master, no Salem House, no David Copperfield,\nno anything but heavy sleep.\n   I dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal\nflute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him\nin her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of his chair and gave him\nan affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing for a\nmoment. I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking, either\nthen or immediately afterwards ; for, as he resumed-it was a real fact\nthat he had stopped playing-I saw and heard the same old woman ask\nMrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs.\nFibbitson replied, '&lt; Ay, ay ! Yes ! \" and nodded at the fire : to which, I\nam persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.\n   When I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at Salem\nHouse unscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them up as before,\nand took me away. We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon\nthe roof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to\ntake up somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers,\nand where I slept profoundly, until I found the coach going at a footpace\nup a steep hill among green leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come\nto its destination.\n   A short walk brought us-I mean the Master and me-to Salem House,\nwhich was enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very dull. Over a\ndoor in this wall was a board with SALEMHOUSEupon it ; and through\na grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a\nsurly face, which I found, on the door being opened, belonged to a stout\nman with a bull-neck, a wooden leg, overhanging temples, and his hair cut\nclose all round his head.\n   \" The new boy,\" said the Master.\n   The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over-it didn't take long,\nfor there was not much of me-and locked the gate behind us, and took\nout the key. We were going up to the house, among some dark heavy\ntrees, when he called after my conductor.\n   \" Hall0 ! \"\n   We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where\nhe lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.\n   \" Here ! The cobbler's been,\" he said, \" since you 've been out,\nMr. Mell, and he says he can't mend 'em any more. H e says there an't\na bit of the original boot left, and he wonders you expect it.\"\n   With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went back\na few paces to pick them up, and looked at them (very disconsolately,\nI was afraid), as we went on together. I observed then, for the first\ntime, that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear, and\nthat his stocking was just breaking out in one place, like a bud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n115\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            57\n    Salem House was a square brick building with wings ; of a bare and\nunfurnished appearance. All about it was so very quiet, that I said to\nMr. Mell I supposed the boys were out ; but he seemed surprised at my not\nknowing that it was holiday-time. That all the boys were at their several\nhomes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down by the sea-side with\nMrs. and Miss Creakle ; and that I was sent in holiday-time as a punish-\nment for my misdoing, all of which he explained to me as we went along.\n   I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most\nforlorn and desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long room\nwith three long rows of desks, and six of forms, and bristling all round\nwith pegs for hats and slates. Scraps of old copybooks and exercises,\nlitter the dirty floor. Some silkworms' houses, made of the same materials,\nare scattered over the desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind\nby their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of paste-\nboard and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything\nto eat. A bird, in a cage a very little bigger than himself, makes a mournful\nrattle now and then in hopping on his perch, two inches high, or dropping\nfrom it ; but neither sings nor chirps. There is a strange unwholesome\nsmell upon the room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet apples wanting air,\nand rotten books. There could not well be more ink splashed about it, if\nit had been roofless from its first construction, and the skies had rained,\nsnowed, hailed, and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year.\n   Mr. Me11 having left me while he took his irreparable boots up-stairs, I\nwent softly to the upper end of the room, observing all this as I crept\nalong. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written,\nwhich was lying on the desk, and bore these words-\" Take care of him.\nH e bites.\"\n   I got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great dog\nunderneath. But, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, I could\nsee nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering about, when Mr. Mell\ncame back, and asked me what I did up there.\n   \" I beg your pardon, sir,\" says I, &lt;'   if you please, I 'm looking for the\ndog.\"\n   \" Dog,? \" says he. \" What dog ? \"\n   \" Isn t it a dog, sir ? \"\n   \" Isn 't what a dog ? \"\n   \" That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites.\"\n   \" No, Copperfield,\" says he gravely, \" that's not a dog. That 's a boy.\nMy instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back. I am\nsorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must do it.\"\n   With that, he took me down, and tied the placard, which was neatly\nconstructed for the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; and\nwherever I went, afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying it.\n   What I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine. Whether\nit was possible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that\nsomebody was reading it. I t was no relief to turn round and find\nnobody; for wherever my back was, there I imagined somebody always\nto be. That cruel man with the wooden leg, aggravated my sufferings.\nH e was in authority; and if he ever saw me leaning against a tree,\nor a wall, or the house, he roared out from his lodge-door in a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nstupendous voice, \"Hallo, you sir ! You Copperfield! Show that\nbadge conspicuous, or I'll report you!\"              The playground was a\nbare gravelled yard, open to all the back of the house and the offices;\nand I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher read it, and\nthe baker read i t ; that everybody, in a word, who came backwards\nand forwaxds to the house, of a morning when I was ordered to walk\nthere, read that I was to be taken care of, for I bit. I recollect that I posi-\ntively began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy who did bite.\n   There was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had\na custom of carving their names. I t was completely covered with\nsuch inscriptions. I n my dread of the end of the vacation and\ntheir coming back, I could not read a boy's name, without enquiring\nin what tone and with what emphasis he would read, \"Take care\nof him. H e bites.\" There was one boy-a               certain J. Steerforth-\nwho cut his name very deep and very often, who, I conceived, would\nread it in a rather strong voice, and afterwards pull my hair. There\nwas another boy, one Tommy Traddles, who I dreaded would make game\nof it, and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me. There was a third,\nGeorge Demple, who I fancied would sing it. I have looked, a little\nshrinking creature, at that door, until the owners of all the names-there\nwere five-and-forty of them in the school then, Mr. Me11 said-seemed to\nsend me to Coventry by general acclamation, and to cry out, each in his\nown way, '&lt; Take care of him. He bites ! \"\n   I t was the same with the places at the desks and forms. I t was the\nsame with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my way to,\nand when I was in, my own bed. I remember dreaming night after night,\nof being with my mother as she used to be, or of going to a party at\nMr. Peggotty's, or of travelling outside the stage-coach, or of dining again\nwith my unfortunate friend the waiter, and in all these circumstances\nmaking people scream and stare, by the unhappy disclosure that I had\nnothing on but my little night-shirt, and that placard.\n   I n the monotony of my life, and in my constant apprehension of the\nreopening of the school, it was such an insupportable affliction ! I had\nlong tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, there being no\nMr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them without disgrace.\nBefore, and after them, I walked about-supervised, as I have mentioned,\nby the man with the woodenleg. How vividly I call to mind the damp\nabout the house, the green cracked flagstones in the court, an old leaky\nwater-butt, and the discolored trunks of some of the grim trees, which\nseemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees, and to\nhave blown less in the sun ! At one we dined, Mr. Me11 and I, at the\nupper end of a long bare dining-room, full of deal tables, and smelling of\nfat. Then, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Me11 drank out\nof a blue teacup, and I out of a tin pot. All day long, and until seven\nor eight in the evening, Mr. Mell, at his own detached desk in the\nschoolroom, worked hard with pen, ink, ruler, books, and writing-paper,\nmaking out the bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put\nup his things for the night he took out his flute, and blew at it,\nuntil I almost thought he would gradually blow his whole being into\nthe large hole at the top, and ooze away at the keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\n    I picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting with my\nhead upon my hand, listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and\nconning to-morrow's lessons. I picture myself with my books shut up,\nstill listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening through\ni t to what used to be at home, and to the blowing of the wind on\nYarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary. I picture myself\ngoing u p to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side\ncrying for a comfortable word from Peggotty. I picture myself coming\ndown stairs in the morning, and looking through a long ghastly gash\nof a staircase-window, at the school-bell hanging on the top of an\nouthouse, with a weathercock above it ; and dreading the time when it\nshall ring J. Steerforth and the rest to work : which is only second, in my\nforeboding apprehensions, to the time when the man with the wooden leg\nshall unlock the rusty gate to give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle.\nI cannot think I was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects,\nbut in all of them I carried the same warning on my back.\n    Mr. Me11 never said much to me, but he was never harsh to me. I\nsuppose we were company to each other, without talking. I forgot to\nmention that he would talk to himself sometimes, and grin, and clench his\nfist, and grind his teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner.\nBut he had these peculiarities : and at first they frightened me, though I\nsoon got used to them.\n\n\n\n\n                             CHAPTER TI.\n              I ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE.\n\n   I HAD led this life about a month, when the man with the wooden leg\nbegan to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water, from which I\ninferred that preparations were making to receive Mr. Creakle and the\nboys. I was not mistaken; for the mop came into the schoolroom before\nlong, and turned out Mr. Me11 and me, who lived where we could, and\ngot on how we could, for some days, during which we were always in\nthe way of two or three young women, who had rarely shown themselves\nbefore, and were so continually in the midst of dust that I sneezed almost\nas much as if Salem House had been a great snuff-box.\n   One day I was informed by Mr. Mell, that Mr. Creakle would be home\nthat evening. I n the evening, after tea, I heard that he was come. Before\nbed-time, I was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear\nbefore him.\n   Mr. Creakle's part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than\nours, and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant after the dusty\nplayground, which was such a desert in miniature, that I thought no one\nbut a camel, or a dromedary, could have felt at home in it. I t seemed to\nme a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked comfortable,\nas I went on my way, trembling, to Mr. Creakle's presence : which so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n118\n\n60            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERLENCE\n\nabashed me, when I was ushered into it, that I hardly saw Mrs. Creakle\nor Miss Creakle (who were both there, in the parlor), or anything but\nMr. Creakle, a stout gentleman with a bunch of watch-chain and seals, in\nan arm-chair, with a tumbler and bottle beside him.\n   \"So ! \" said Mr. Creakle. \" This is the young gentleman whose teeth\nare to be filed ! Turn him round.\"\n   The wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard ;\nand haying afforded time for a full survey of it, turned me about again,\nwith my face to Mr. Creakle, and posted himself at Mr. Creakle's side.\nMr. Creakle's face was fiery, and his eyes were small, and deep in his\nhead; he had thick veins in his forehead, a little nose, and a large chin.\nH e was bald on the top of his head ; and had some thin wet-looking hair\nthat was just turning grey, brushed across each temple, so that the two\nsides interlaced on his forehead. But the circumstance about him which\nimpressed me most, was, that he had no voice, but spoke in a whisper.\nThe exertion this cost him, or the consciousness of talking in that feeble\nway, made his angry face so much more angry, and his thick veins so\nmuch thicker, when he spoke, that I am not surprised, on looking back,\nat this peculiarity striking me as his chief one.\n   \" Now, \" said Mr. Creakle. \" What's the report of this boy ? \"\n   \" There's nothing against him yet, \" returned the man with the wooden\n\nleg. \" There has been no opportunity. \"\n   I thought Mr. Creakle was disappointed. I thought Mrs. and Miss\nCreakle (at whom I now glanced for the first time, and who were, both,\nthin and quiet) were not disappointed.\n   \" Come here, sir ! \" said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me.\n\n   \" Come here ! \" said the man with the wooden leg, repeating the\ngesture.\n   \"I have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law,\" whispered\nMr. Creakle, taking me by the ear; \" and a worthy man he is, and a\nman of a strong character. He knows me, and I know him. Do you\nknow me ? Hey ? \" said Mr. Creakle, pinching my ear with ferocious\nplayfulness.\n   \"Not yet, sir,\" I said, flinching with the pain.\n   \"Not yet ? Hey? \" repeated Mr. Creakle. \"But you will soon. Hey ? \"\n   \" You will soon.     Hey ? \" repeated the man with the wooden leg. I\nafterwards found that he generally acted, with his strong voice, as\nMr. Creakle's interpreter to the boys.\n   I was very much frightened, and said, I hoped so, if he pleased. I felt,\nall this while, as if my ear were blazing ; he pinched it so hard.\n   \" I'll tell you what I am,\" whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it go at last,\nwith a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes. \"I 'm a\nTartar.\"\n   \" A Tartar,\" said the man with the wooden leg.\n   \" When I say I'll do a thing, I do it,\" said Mr. Creakle ; '&lt; and when\nI say I will have a thing done, I will have it done.\"\n   \"-Will have a thing done, I will have it done,\" repeated the man\nwith the wooden leg.\n   \" I am a determined character,\" said Mr. Creakle. \" That 's what I\n am. I do my duty. That's what I do My flesh and blood \"-he\n\n\n\n\n\n\n119\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\nlooked at Mrs. Creakle as he said this-\" when it rises against me, is not\nmy flesh and blood. I discard it. Has that fellow,\" to the man with\nthe wooden leg, \" been here again ? \"\n    \" No,\" was the answer.\n   \" No,\" said Mr. Creakle. \" H e knows better. He knows me. Let\nhim keep away. I say let him keep away,\" said Mr. Creakle, striking his\nhand upon the table, and looking at Mrs. Creakle, \"for he knows me.\nNow you have begun to know me too, my young friend, and you may go.\nTake him away.\"\n   I was very glad to be ordered away, for Mrs. and Miss Creakle were\nboth wiping their eyes, and I felt as uncomfortable for them, as I did\nfor myself. But I had a petition on my mind which concerned me so\nnearly, that I couldn 't help saying, though I wondered at my own courage :\n   \" If you please, sir-\"\n   Mr. Creakle whispered, \" Hah ? What's this ? \" and bent his eyes\nupon me, as if he would have burnt me up with them.\n   \" If you please, sir,\" I faltered, \"if I might be allowed (I am very\n\nsorry indeed, sir, for what I did) to take this writing off, before the boys\ncome back-\"\n   Whether Mr Creakle was in earnest, or whether he only did it to\nfrighten me I don't know, but he made a burst out of his chair, before\nwhich I precipitately retreated, without waiting for the escort of the\nman with the wooden leg, and never once stopped until I reached\nmy own bedroom, where, finding I was not pursued, I went to bed, as\nit was time, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours.\n   Next morning Mr. Sharp came back. Mr. Sharp was the first master,\nand superior to Mr. Mell. Mr. Me11 took his meals with the boys, hut\nMr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle's table. He was a limp,\ndelicate-looking gentleman, I thought, with a good deal of nose, and a way\nof carrying his head on one side, as if it were a little too heavy for\nhim. His hair was very smooth and wavy; but I was informed by the\nvery first boy who came back that it was a wig (a second-hand one he\nsaid), and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it\ncurled.\n   I t was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of\nintelligence. He was the first boy who returned. He introduced himself\nby informing me that I should find his name on the right-hand corner of\nthe gate, over the top bolt ; upon that I said, \" Traddles ? \" to which\nhe replied, \"The same,\" and then he asked me for a full account of myself\nand &amp;mily.\n   I t was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. H e\nenjoyed my placard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment of\neither disclosure or concealment, by presenting me to every other boy who\ncame back, great or smal1,immediatelyon his arriva1,in this form of introduc-\ntion, \"Look here ! Here's a game ! \" Happily, too, the greater part of the\nboys came back low-spirited, and were not so boisterous at my expense as\nI had expected. Some of them certainly did dance about me like wild\nIndians, and the greater part could not resist the temptation of pretending\nthat I was a dog, and patting and smoothing me lest I should bite, and\nsaying, \"Lie down, sir !\" and calling me Towzer. This was naturally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n62            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nconfusing, among so many strangers, and cost me some tears, but on the\nwhole it was much better than I had anticipated.\n   I was not considered as being formally received into the school, however,\nuntil J. Steerforth arrived. Before this boy, who was reputed to be a\ngreat scholar, and was very good-looking, and at least half-a-dozen years\nmy senior, I was carried as before a magistrate. H e enquired, under a shed\nin the playground, into the particulars of my punishment, and was pleased\nto express his opinion that it was \" a jolly shame ;\" for which I became\nbound to him ever afterwards.\n   \"What money have you got, Copperfield? \" he said, walking aside with\nme when he had disposed of my affair in these terms.\n   I told him seven shillings.\n   \" You had better give it to me to take care of,\" he said. \"At least,\nyou can if you like. You needn't if you don't like.\"\n   I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and open in^\nPeggotty's purse, turned it upside down into his hand.\n   \" Do you want to spend anything now? \" he asked me.\n\n   \" No, thank you,\" I replied.\n   \" You can if you like, you know,\" said Steerforth. \" Say the word.\"\n   \"No, thank you, sir,\" I repeated.\n   \" Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of\ncurrant wine by-and-by, up in the bedroom? \" said Steerforth. \" You\nbelong to my bedroom, I find.\"\n   It certainly had not occurred to me before, but I said, Yes, I should\nlike that.\n   \"Very good,\" said Steerforth. \" You'll be glad to spend another\nshilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say? \"\n   1 said, Yes, I should like that, too.\n   \" And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh? \"\n\nsaid Steerforth. \" I say, young Copperfield, you 're going it ! \"\n   I smiled because he smiled, but I was a little troubled in my mind, too.\n   \" Well ! \" said Steerforth.   \" We must make it stretch as far as we\ncan; that's all. I 'll do the best in my power for you. I can go out\nwhen I like, and I'll smuggle the prog in.\" With these words he put the\nmoney in his pocket, and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy; he\nwould take care it should be all right.\n   H e was as good as his word, if that were all right which I had a secret\nmisgiving was nearly all wrong-for I feared it was a waste of my mother's\ntwo half-crowns-though      I had preserved the piece of paper they were\nwrapped in: which was a precious saving. When we went up-stairs\nto bed, he produced the whole seven shillings' worth, and laid it out on\nmy bed in the moonlight, saying :\n   \"There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal spread you 'ye got ! \"\n   I couldn't think of doing the honors of the feast, at my time of life,\nwhile he was by; my hand shook at the very thought of it. I begged\nhim to do me the favor of presiding; and my request being seconded by\nthe other boys who were in that room, he acceded to it, and sat upon my\npillow, handing round the viands-with perfect fairness, I must say-and\ndispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was his\n own property. As to me, I sat on his left hand, and the rest were grouped\n about us, on the nearest beds and on the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n121\n\n                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.\n\n    How .well I recollect our sitting there, talking in whispers ; or their\ntalking, and my respectfully listening, I ought rather to say; the moon-\nlight falling a little way into the room, through the window, painting a\npale window on the floor, and the greater part of us in shadow, except\nwhen Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorous-box, when he wanted\nto look for anything on the board, and shed a blue glare over us that was\ngone directly ! A certain mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness,\nthe secresy of the revel, and the whisper in which everything was said,\nsteals over me again, and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling\nof solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that they are all so near, and\nfrightens me (though I feign to laugh) when Traddles pretends to see\na ghost in the corner.\n    I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it. I\nheard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar\nwithout reason; that he was the-sternest and most severe of masters;\nthat he laid about him, right and left, every day of his life, charging in\namong the boys like a trooper, and slashing away, unmercifully. That he\nknew nothing himself, but the art of slashing, being more ignorant (J.\n Steerforth said) than the lowest boy in the school; that he had been,\na good many years ago, a small hop-dealer in the Borough, and had taken\nto the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops, and making away\nwith Mrs. Creakle's money. With a good deal more of that sort, which\nI wondered how they knew.\n    I heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay,\nwas an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business,\nbut had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence,\nas was supposed among the boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr.\nCreakle's service, and having done a deal of dishonest work for him, and\nknowing his secrets. I heard that with the single exception of Mr.\n Creakle, Tungay considered the whole establishment, masters and boys,\nas his natural enemies, and that the only delight of his life was to be sour\nand malicious. I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son, who had not been\nTungay's friend, and who, assisting in the school, had once held some\nremonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very\ncruelly exercised, and was supposed, besides, to have protested against\nhis father's usage of his mother. I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned\nhim out of doors, in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had\nbeen in a sad way, ever since.\n    But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being\n one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that\nboy being J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was\n stated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it. On being\n asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed if he did begin to see\n him do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorous-box on purpose to sheda\nglare over his reply, and said he would commence by knocking him down\nwith a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that was\nalways on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark for some time, breathless.\n    I heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Me11 were both supposed to be\nwretchedly paid; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at\nMr. Creakle's table, Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n122\n\n64            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE\n\ncold; which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the only parlor-\nboarder. I heard that Mr. Sharp's wig didn't fit him; and that he\nneedn't be so \" bounceable\"-somebody else said \" bumptious \"-about it,\nbecause his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind.\n   I heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant's son, came as a set-off\nagainst the coal-bill, and was called on that account \"Exchange or\nBarter \"-a      name selected from the arithmetic-book as expressing this\narrangement. I heard that the table-beer was a robbery of parents, and\nthe pudding an imposition. I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the\nschool in general as being in love with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I sat\nin the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine face, and his easy\nmanner, and his curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard that\nMr. Me11 was not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to bless\nhimself with ; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his mother,\nwas as poor as Job. I thought of my breakfast then, and what had\nsounded like \"My Charley ! \" but I was, I am glad to remember, as mute\nas a mouse about it.\n   The hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the banquet\nsome time. The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as\nthe eating and drinking were over; and we, who had remained whisper-\ning and listening half undressed, at last betook ourselves to bed, too.\n   \" Good night, young Copperfield,\" said Steerforth, \"I'll take care\nof you.\"\n   \"You 're very kind,\" I gratefully returned. \" I am very much obliged\nto you.\"\n   \"You haven't got a sister, have you? \" said Steerforth, yawning.\n   \" NO,\" I answered.\n   \" That's a pity,\" said Steerforth. \"If you had had one, I should\nthink she would have been a pretty, timid, little, bright-eyed sort of girl.\nI should have liked to know her. Good night, young Copperfield.\"\n   \" Good night, sir,\" I replied.\n   I thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, I\nrecollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with his handsome\nface turned up, and his head reclining easily on his arm. He was a\nperson of great power in my eyes ; that was of course the reason of my\nmind running on him. No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the\nmoonbeams. There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps, in the\ngarden that I dreamed of walking in all night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n123\n\n                       COMPLETION\n\nKNIGHT'S SHILLING VOLUMES\n                      FOR ALL READERS,\n                                  PUBLISHED BY\n\n           C. COX, 12, KING WILLIAM STREET, STRAND.\n\n\n                  POSTSCRIPT, BY THE EDITOR,\n          TO THE CONCLUDING VOLUME OF THE SERIES, ENTITLED\n                RAMBLES BY RIVERS : THE THAMES,\" VOL. 11.\n\n\n\nTHISSeries was commenced in June, 1844. I t has been continued, first in\nWeekly Volumes, and subsequently in Monthly Volumes, for five years. The\nSeries is now terminated with the publication of the 186th volume.\n  The Series divides itself into three distinct portions :-\n           The Weekly and Monthly Volulnes - - - -              - -\n           The cabinet Portrait ~ a l l e of\n                                          r ~British Worthies   - -   12\n           The Cabinet History of England - - - - -             - -   26--186\n\n   I n the original announcement of this work I thus stated the objects which IL\nwould endeavour to attain :-\n   \" W e propose to place within the reach of all readers a series of books\nwhich shall ultimately comprehend something like that range of literature\nwhich well-educated persons desire to have a t their command. I n this series\nthere will be no attempt a t exclusiveness. W e shall not take up the most\nfalse and dangerous opinion that the understandings of the masses should be\nwritten down to, nor will mere didactic instruction only be attempted. A\ntaste for knowledge is not so induced. The recreation of genial and amusing\nreading should be offered in connexion with what is solid and serious. The\npublishers possess many valuable copyrights which may be readily adapted to\nthis purpose. There is a great deal also to be done anew, in the way of\njudicious compilations, of translations from foreign works, and of original\nproductions by authors of ability, conceived in a right spirit. W e have many\noffers of assistance from writers of established reputation, who feel that the\ncirculation of their thoughts in a cheap pocket volume is a tribute to their\nusefulness and their reputation. W e have no want of materials to conduct\nthis undertaking steadily and extensively.\"\n   I now venture to believe that I have accomplished what I proposed to do.\n   First,-I have endeavoured to produce a series of books which comprehends\nsomething like that range of literature which well-educated persons desire to\nhave at their command. Without attempting any very exact classification of\n                                                                      B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n124\n\n               COMPLETION OF KNIGHT'S SHILLING VOLUMES.\n\nthe various subjects of these volumes, they may be thus distributed into large\ndepartments of knowledge :-\n                                                                                 . ----\n                                                                                 Vnlq.\n         Analytical Accounts of great Writers, English        and Foreign    - 13\n         Biography - - - - - - - - - - -                        - - - -      - 33\n         General History - - - - - - - - -                      - - - -      - 5\n         English History - - - - - - .                                       - 26\n         Geography, Travels, and Topography - -                              - 33\n         Natural History - - - - - - - -                                     - 17\n         Fine Arts and Antiquities - - - - -                                 -  8\n         Arts and Sciences, Political Philosophy, &amp;c. -                      - 14\n         Natural Theology and Philosophy - - - -                             - 15\n         General Literature - - - - - - - - -                   -   -    - - - 16\n         Original Fiction - - - - - - - - -                     -   -    - - -      6-186\n   Secondly,-The very nature of the subjects thus comprised in this series\nwill show that mere didactic instruction has not been attempted; and that\ngenial and amusing reading is presented in connexion with the solid and\nserious. I t would be contrary to the principles upon which I have always\nregarded the duties of those who labour in the great cause of making good\nliterature cheap, if I had in this series presumed it necessary to write down\nto the understandings of the masses. I shall never cease to believe that\nwhatever is best and most permanent in literature has a character of univer-\nsality ; and that whenever attempts are made to \" write down \" to a class, or\n\" write up \" to a class, the thing so produced is worthy of small regard, and\n\nhas little influence in its own day, and less upon the future.\n    Lastly,-In    stating that I should introduce valuable copyrights into this\nSeries, and that I had offers of assistance from writers of established repu-\ntation, it may be sufficient to point to the names of the various authors\" of\nthese volumes, all of which are original, to show that I have fulfilled this\nportion of my undertaking.\n   The property of this large Series passed out of my hands as its publisher in\nthe beginning of 1847, in consequence of business arrangements connected\nwith a dissolution of partnership. Since then the additions to the Series have\nbeen, for the most part, reprints of copyright works, which were formerly\npublished by me. I have never ceased to consider myself responsible for the\ngeneral character of the work, although my editorial labours had terminated\nwhen about two-thirds of the Series were completed. I may truly add, that\nmy desire for the constant and increasing circulation of these Volumes con-\ntinues unabated ; for I may venture to hope that each and all have a tendency\nto carry forward that intellectual progress upon which the future destiny of\nthis country so essentially depends. And I may confidently state that in this\nextensive series no single work, and no portion of a work, can be found, that\nmay not safely be put into the hands of the young and the uninformed, with\nthe security that it will neither mislead nor corrupt.\n                                                                              KNIGHT.\n                                                                        CHARLES\n  St. John's Wood,\n        April 24, 1849.\n                     * See List of Contributors to the Series, next page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125\n\n                                                   C.

The Guttenberg file does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and therefore should not be taken too seriously as an edition. I use the text mostly to show a few affordances of using Ed for long form narrative. This page, for example, showcases a different sidebar than the rest of our sample site, with a table of content of the novel generated out of metadata in the source file. In addition, reading morsels of the novel on your different devices can give you a sense of the experience of reading prose using Ed, and shows you an example of the optional sidebar with a table of contents. A few other features of this page are described in more detail in the Documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNARRATIVEOF THELIFEOF\n\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS\n\nANAMERICAN SLAVE.WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.\n\n\nBOSTON\n\nPUBLISHED AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE,NO. 25 CORNHILL1845\n\nENTERED, ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS,IN THE YEAR 1845BY FREDERICK DOUGLASS,IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT COURTOF MASSACHUSETTS.\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nIn the month of August, 1841, I attended an anti-slavery convention in Nantucket, at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with Frederick Douglass, the writer of the following Narrative. He was a stranger to nearly every member of that body; but, having recently made his escape from the southern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists,—of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave,—he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion alluded to, though at that time a resident in New Bedford.\n\nFortunate, most fortunate occurrence!—fortunate for the millions of his manacled brethren, yet panting for deliverance from their awful thraldom!—fortunate for the cause of negro emancipation, and of universal liberty!—fortunate for the land of his birth, which he has already done so much to save and bless!—fortunate for a large circle of friends and acquaintances, whose sympathy and affection he has strongly secured by the many sufferings he has endured, by his virtuous traits of character, by his ever-abiding remembrance of those who are in bonds, as being bound with them!—fortunate for the multitudes, in various parts of our republic, whose minds he has enlightened on the subject of slavery, and who have been melted to tears by his pathos, or roused to virtuous indignation by his stirring eloquence against the enslavers of men!—fortunate for himself, as it at once brought him into the field of public usefulness, “gave the world assurance of a MAN,” quickened the slumbering energies of his soul, and consecrated him to the great work of breaking the rod of the oppressor, and letting the oppressed go free!\n\nI shall never forget his first speech at the convention—the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind—the powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory, completely taken by surprise—the applause which followed from the beginning to the end of his felicitous remarks. I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it, on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more clear than ever. There stood one, in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact—in intellect richly endowed—in natural eloquence a prodigy—in soul manifestly “created but a little lower than the angels”—yet a slave, ay, a fugitive slave,—trembling for his safety, hardly daring to believe that on the American soil, a single white person could be found who would befriend him at all hazards, for the love of God and humanity! Capable of high attainments as an intellectual and moral being—needing nothing but a comparatively small amount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing to his race—by the law of the land, by the voice of the people, by the terms of the slave code, he was only a piece of property, a beast of burden, a chattel personal, nevertheless!\n\nA beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on Mr. Douglass to address the convention: He came forward to the platform with a hesitancy and embarrassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a novel position. After apologizing for his ignorance, and reminding the audience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart, he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as a slave, and in the course of his speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrilling reflections. As soon as he had taken his seat, filled with hope and admiration, I rose, and declared that Patrick Henry, of revolutionary fame, never made a speech more eloquent in the cause of liberty, than the one we had just listened to from the lips of that hunted fugitive. So I believed at that time—such is my belief now. I reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this self-emancipated young man at the North,—even in Massachusetts, on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers, among the descendants of revolutionary sires; and I appealed to them, whether they would ever allow him to be carried back into slavery,—law or no law, constitution or no constitution. The response was unanimous and in thunder-tones—”NO!” “Will you succor and protect him as a brother-man—a resident of the old Bay State?” “YES!” shouted the whole mass, with an energy so startling, that the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon’s line might almost have heard the mighty burst of feeling, and recognized it as the pledge of an invincible determination, on the part of those who gave it, never to betray him that wanders, but to hide the outcast, and firmly to abide the consequences.\n\nIt was at once deeply impressed upon my mind, that, if Mr. Douglass could be persuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion of the anti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would be given to it, and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a colored complexion. I therefore endeavored to instil hope and courage into his mind, in order that he might dare to engage in a vocation so anomalous and responsible for a person in his situation; and I was seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends, especially by the late General Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, Mr. John A. Collins, whose judgment in this instance entirely coincided with my own. At first, he could give no encouragement; with unfeigned diffidence, he expressed his conviction that he was not adequate to the performance of so great a task; the path marked out was wholly an untrodden one; he was sincerely apprehensive that he should do more harm than good. After much deliberation, however, he consented to make a trial; and ever since that period, he has acted as a lecturing agent, under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. In labors he has been most abundant; and his success in combating prejudice, in gaining proselytes, in agitating the public mind, has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his brilliant career. He has borne himself with gentleness and meekness, yet with true manliness of character. As a public speaker, he excels in pathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of reasoning, and fluency of language. There is in him that union of head and heart, which is indispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts of others. May his strength continue to be equal to his day! May he continue to “grow in grace, and in the knowledge of God,” that he may be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity, whether at home or abroad!\n\nIt is certainly a very remarkable fact, that one of the most efficient advocates of the slave population, now before the public, is a fugitive slave, in the person of Frederick Douglass; and that the free colored population of the United States are as ably represented by one of their own number, in the person of Charles Lenox Remond, whose eloquent appeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides of the Atlantic. Let the calumniators of the colored race despise themselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit, and henceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who require nothing but time and opportunity to attain to the highest point of human excellence.\n\nIt may, perhaps, be fairly questioned, whether any other portion of the population of the earth could have endured the privations, sufferings and horrors of slavery, without having become more degraded in the scale of humanity than the slaves of African descent. Nothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects, darken their minds, debase their moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind; and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage, under which they have been groaning for centuries! To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man,—to show that he has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superior to those of his black brother,—Daniel O’connell, the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation, and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the Loyal National Repeal Association, March 31, 1845. “No matter,” said Mr. O’connell, “under what specious term it may disguise itself, slavery is still hideous. It has a natural, an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man. An American sailor, who was cast away on the shore of Africa, where he was kept in slavery for three years, was, at the expiration of that period, found to be imbruted and stultified—he had lost all reasoning power; and having forgotten his native language, could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic and English, which nobody could understand, and which even he himself found difficulty in pronouncing. So much for the humanizing influence of The Domestic Institution!” Admitting this to have been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at least that the white slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one.\n\nMr. Douglass has very properly chosen to write his own Narrative, in his own style, and according to the best of his ability, rather than to employ some one else. It is, therefore, entirely his own production; and, considering how long and dark was the career he had to run as a slave,—how few have been his opportunities to improve his mind since he broke his iron fetters,—it is, in my judgment, highly creditable to his head and heart. He who can peruse it without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit,—without being filled with an unutterable abhorrence of slavery and all its abettors, and animated with a determination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrable system,—without trembling for the fate of this country in the hands of a righteous God, who is ever on the side of the oppressed, and whose arm is not shortened that it cannot save,—must have a flinty heart, and be qualified to act the part of a trafficker “in slaves and the souls of men.” I am confident that it is essentially true in all its statements; that nothing has been set down in malice, nothing exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination; that it comes short of the reality, rather than overstates a single fact in regard to slavery as it is. The experience of Frederick Douglass, as a slave, was not a peculiar one; his lot was not especially a hard one; his case may be regarded as a very fair specimen of the treatment of slaves in Maryland, in which State it is conceded that they are better fed and less cruelly treated than in Georgia, Alabama, or Louisiana. Many have suffered incomparably more, while very few on the plantations have suffered less, than himself. Yet how deplorable was his situation! what terrible chastisements were inflicted upon his person! what still more shocking outrages were perpetrated upon his mind! with all his noble powers and sublime aspirations, how like a brute was he treated, even by those professing to have the same mind in them that was in Christ Jesus! to what dreadful liabilities was he continually subjected! how destitute of friendly counsel and aid, even in his greatest extremities! how heavy was the midnight of woe which shrouded in blackness the last ray of hope, and filled the future with terror and gloom! what longings after freedom took possession of his breast, and how his misery augmented, in proportion as he grew reflective and intelligent,—thus demonstrating that a happy slave is an extinct man! how he thought, reasoned, felt, under the lash of the driver, with the chains upon his limbs! what perils he encountered in his endeavors to escape from his horrible doom! and how signal have been his deliverance and preservation in the midst of a nation of pitiless enemies!\n\nThis Narrative contains many affecting incidents, many passages of great eloquence and power; but I think the most thrilling one of them all is the description Douglass gives of his feelings, as he stood soliloquizing respecting his fate, and the chances of his one day being a freeman, on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay—viewing the receding vessels as they flew with their white wings before the breeze, and apostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit of freedom. Who can read that passage, and be insensible to its pathos and sublimity? Compressed into it is a whole Alexandrian library of thought, feeling, and sentiment—all that can, all that need be urged, in the form of expostulation, entreaty, rebuke, against that crime of crimes,—making man the property of his fellow-man! O, how accursed is that system, which entombs the godlike mind of man, defaces the divine image, reduces those who by creation were crowned with glory and honor to a level with four-footed beasts, and exalts the dealer in human flesh above all that is called God! Why should its existence be prolonged one hour? Is it not evil, only evil, and that continually? What does its presence imply but the absence of all fear of God, all regard for man, on the part of the people of the United States? Heaven speed its eternal overthrow!\n\nSo profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery are many persons, that they are stubbornly incredulous whenever they read or listen to any recital of the cruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims. They do not deny that the slaves are held as property; but that terrible fact seems to convey to their minds no idea of injustice, exposure to outrage, or savage barbarity. Tell them of cruel scourgings, of mutilations and brandings, of scenes of pollution and blood, of the banishment of all light and knowledge, and they affect to be greatly indignant at such enormous exaggerations, such wholesale misstatements, such abominable libels on the character of the southern planters! As if all these direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery! As if it were less cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a thing, than to give him a severe flagellation, or to deprive him of necessary food and clothing! As if whips, chains, thumb-screws, paddles, blood-hounds, overseers, drivers, patrols, were not all indispensable to keep the slaves down, and to give protection to their ruthless oppressors! As if, when the marriage institution is abolished, concubinage, adultery, and incest, must not necessarily abound; when all the rights of humanity are annihilated, any barrier remains to protect the victim from the fury of the spoiler; when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty, it will not be wielded with destructive sway! Skeptics of this character abound in society. In some few instances, their incredulity arises from a want of reflection; but, generally, it indicates a hatred of the light, a desire to shield slavery from the assaults of its foes, a contempt of the colored race, whether bond or free. Such will try to discredit the shocking tales of slaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative; but they will labor in vain. Mr. Douglass has frankly disclosed the place of his birth, the names of those who claimed ownership in his body and soul, and the names also of those who committed the crimes which he has alleged against them. His statements, therefore, may easily be disproved, if they are untrue.\n\nIn the course of his Narrative, he relates two instances of murderous cruelty,—in one of which a planter deliberately shot a slave belonging to a neighboring plantation, who had unintentionally gotten within his lordly domain in quest of fish; and in the other, an overseer blew out the brains of a slave who had fled to a stream of water to escape a bloody scourging. Mr. Douglass states that in neither of these instances was any thing done by way of legal arrest or judicial investigation. The Baltimore American, of March 17, 1845, relates a similar case of atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunity as follows: “Shooting a slave.—We learn, upon the authority of a letter from Charles county, Maryland, received by a gentleman of this city, that a young man, named Matthews, a nephew of General Matthews, and whose father, it is believed, holds an office at Washington, killed one of the slaves upon his father’s farm by shooting him. The letter states that young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm; that he gave an order to the servant, which was disobeyed, when he proceeded to the house, obtained a gun, and, returning, shot the servant. He immediately, the letter continues, fled to his father’s residence, where he still remains unmolested.”—Let it never be forgotten, that no slaveholder or overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on the person of a slave, however diabolical it may be, on the testimony of colored witnesses, whether bond or free. By the slave code, they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man, as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation. Hence, there is no legal protection in fact, whatever there may be in form, for the slave population; and any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them with impunity. Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?\n\nThe effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters is vividly described in the following Narrative, and shown to be any thing but salutary. In the nature of the case, it must be in the highest degree pernicious. The testimony of Mr. Douglass, on this point, is sustained by a cloud of witnesses, whose veracity is unimpeachable. “A slaveholder’s profession of Christianity is a palpable imposture. He is a felon of the highest grade. He is a man-stealer. It is of no importance what you put in the other scale.”\n\nReader! are you with the man-stealers in sympathy and purpose, or on the side of their down-trodden victims? If with the former, then are you the foe of God and man. If with the latter, what are you prepared to do and dare in their behalf? Be faithful, be vigilant, be untiring in your efforts to break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free. Come what may—cost what it may—inscribe on the banner which you unfurl to the breeze, as your religious and political motto—”NO COMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY! NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!”\n\nWM. LLOYD GARRISON BOSTON,\nMay 1, 1845.\n\n\n\nLETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.\n\nBOSTON, APRIL 22, 1845.\n\nMy Dear Friend:\n\nYou remember the old fable of “The Man and the Lion,” where the lion complained that he should not be so misrepresented “when the lions wrote history.”\n\nI am glad the time has come when the “lions write history.” We have been left long enough to gather the character of slavery from the involuntary evidence of the masters. One might, indeed, rest sufficiently satisfied with what, it is evident, must be, in general, the results of such a relation, without seeking farther to find whether they have followed in every instance. Indeed, those who stare at the half-peck of corn a week, and love to count the lashes on the slave’s back, are seldom the “stuff” out of which reformers and abolitionists are to be made. I remember that, in 1838, many were waiting for the results of the West India experiment, before they could come into our ranks. Those “results” have come long ago; but, alas! few of that number have come with them, as converts. A man must be disposed to judge of emancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the produce of sugar,—and to hate slavery for other reasons than because it starves men and whips women,—before he is ready to lay the first stone of his anti-slavery life.\n\nI was glad to learn, in your story, how early the most neglected of God’s children waken to a sense of their rights, and of the injustice done them. Experience is a keen teacher; and long before you had mastered your A B C, or knew where the “white sails” of the Chesapeake were bound, you began, I see, to gauge the wretchedness of the slave, not by his hunger and want, not by his lashes and toil, but by the cruel and blighting death which gathers over his soul.\n\nIn connection with this, there is one circumstance which makes your recollections peculiarly valuable, and renders your early insight the more remarkable. You come from that part of the country where we are told slavery appears with its fairest features. Let us hear, then, what it is at its best estate—gaze on its bright side, if it has one; and then imagination may task her powers to add dark lines to the picture, as she travels southward to that (for the colored man) Valley of the Shadow of Death, where the Mississippi sweeps along.\n\nAgain, we have known you long, and can put the most entire confidence in your truth, candor, and sincerity. Every one who has heard you speak has felt, and, I am confident, every one who reads your book will feel, persuaded that you give them a fair specimen of the whole truth. No one-sided portrait,—no wholesale complaints,—but strict justice done, whenever individual kindliness has neutralized, for a moment, the deadly system with which it was strangely allied. You have been with us, too, some years, and can fairly compare the twilight of rights, which your race enjoy at the North, with that “noon of night” under which they labor south of Mason and Dixon’s line. Tell us whether, after all, the half-free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off than the pampered slave of the rice swamps!\n\nIn reading your life, no one can say that we have unfairly picked out some rare specimens of cruelty. We know that the bitter drops, which even you have drained from the cup, are no incidental aggravations, no individual ills, but such as must mingle always and necessarily in the lot of every slave. They are the essential ingredients, not the occasional results, of the system.\n\nAfter all, I shall read your book with trembling for you. Some years ago, when you were beginning to tell me your real name and birthplace, you may remember I stopped you, and preferred to remain ignorant of all. With the exception of a vague description, so I continued, till the other day, when you read me your memoirs. I hardly knew, at the time, whether to thank you or not for the sight of them, when I reflected that it was still dangerous, in Massachusetts, for honest men to tell their names! They say the fathers, in 1776, signed the Declaration of Independence with the halter about their necks. You, too, publish your declaration of freedom with danger compassing you around. In all the broad lands which the Constitution of the United States overshadows, there is no single spot,—however narrow or desolate,—where a fugitive slave can plant himself and say, “I am safe.” The whole armory of Northern Law has no shield for you. I am free to say that, in your place, I should throw the MS. into the fire.\n\nYou, perhaps, may tell your story in safety, endeared as you are to so many warm hearts by rare gifts, and a still rarer devotion of them to the service of others. But it will be owing only to your labors, and the fearless efforts of those who, trampling the laws and Constitution of the country under their feet, are determined that they will “hide the outcast,” and that their hearths shall be, spite of the law, an asylum for the oppressed, if, some time or other, the humblest may stand in our streets, and bear witness in safety against the cruelties of which he has been the victim.\n\nYet it is sad to think, that these very throbbing hearts which welcome your story, and form your best safeguard in telling it, are all beating contrary to the “statute in such case made and provided.” Go on, my dear friend, till you, and those who, like you, have been saved, so as by fire, from the dark prison-house, shall stereotype these free, illegal pulses into statutes; and New England, cutting loose from a blood-stained Union, shall glory in being the house of refuge for the oppressed,—till we no longer merely “hide the outcast,” or make a merit of standing idly by while he is hunted in our midst; but, consecrating anew the soil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the oppressed, proclaim our welcome to the slave so loudly, that the tones shall reach every hut in the Carolinas, and make the broken-hearted bondman leap up at the thought of old Massachusetts.\n\nGod speed the day!\n\nTill then, and ever,\nYours truly,\nWENDELL PHILLIPS\n\n\n\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS.\n\nFrederick Douglass was born in slavery as Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey near Easton in Talbot County, Maryland. He was not sure of the exact year of his birth, but he knew that it was 1817 or 1818. As a young boy he was sent to Baltimore, to be a house servant, where he learned to read and write, with the assistance of his master’s wife. In 1838 he escaped from slavery and went to New York City, where he married Anna Murray, a free colored woman whom he had met in Baltimore. Soon thereafter he changed his name to Frederick Douglass. In 1841 he addressed a convention of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in Nantucket and so greatly impressed the group that they immediately employed him as an agent. He was such an impressive orator that numerous persons doubted if he had ever been a slave, so he wrote Narrative Of The Life Of Frederick Douglass. During the Civil War he assisted in the recruiting of colored men for the 54th and 55th Massachusetts Regiments and consistently argued for the emancipation of slaves. After the war he was active in securing and protecting the rights of the freemen. In his later years, at different times, he was secretary of the Santo Domingo Commission, marshall and recorder of deeds of the District of Columbia, and United States Minister to Haiti. His other autobiographical works are My Bondage And My Freedom and Life And Times Of Frederick Douglass, published in 1855 and 1881 respectively. He died in 1895.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nI was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.\n\nMy mother was named Harriet Bailey. She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey, both colored, and quite dark. My mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather.\n\nMy father was a white man. He was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage. The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me. My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant—before I knew her as my mother. It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor. For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to hinder the development of the child’s affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child. This is the inevitable result.\n\nI never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night. She was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from my home. She made her journeys to see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot, after the performance of her day’s work. She was a field hand, and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise, unless a slave has special permission from his or her master to the contrary—a permission which they seldom get, and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a kind master. I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. She was with me in the night. She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone. Very little communication ever took place between us. Death soon ended what little we could have while she lived, and with it her hardships and suffering. She died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master’s farms, near Lee’s Mill. I was not allowed to be present during her illness, at her death, or burial. She was gone long before I knew any thing about it. Never having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.\n\nCalled thus suddenly away, she left me without the slightest intimation of who my father was. The whisper that my master was my father, may or may not be true; and, true or false, it is of but little consequence to my purpose whilst the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that slaveholders have ordained, and by law established, that the children of slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their mothers; and this is done too obviously to administer to their own lusts, and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as well as pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the slaveholder, in cases not a few, sustains to his slaves the double relation of master and father.\n\nI know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with, than others. They are, in the first place, a constant offence to their mistress. She is ever disposed to find fault with them; they can seldom do any thing to please her; she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the lash, especially when she suspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his black slaves. The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and, cruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his own children to human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so; for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother, of but few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to his naked back; and if he lisp one word of disapproval, it is set down to his parental partiality, and only makes a bad matter worse, both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend.\n\nEvery year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves. It was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population. Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not, it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south, and are now held in slavery, from those originally brought to this country from Africa; and if their increase do no other good, it will do away the force of the argument, that God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right. If the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved, it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural; for thousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, like myself, owe their existence to white fathers, and those fathers most frequently their own masters.\n\nI have had two masters. My first master’s name was Anthony. I do not remember his first name. He was generally called Captain Anthony—a title which, I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay. He was not considered a rich slaveholder. He owned two or three farms, and about thirty slaves. His farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer. The overseer’s name was Plummer. Mr. Plummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and a savage monster. He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel. I have known him to cut and slash the women’s heads so horribly, that even master would be enraged at his cruelty, and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself. Master, however, was not a humane slaveholder. It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him. He was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of slaveholding. He would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave. I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up to a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood. No words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim, seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose. The louder she screamed, the harder he whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there he whipped longest. He would whip her to make her scream, and whip her to make her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, would he cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin. I remember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition. I was quite a child, but I well remember it. I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing. It was the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant. It struck me with awful force. It was the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery, through which I was about to pass. It was a most terrible spectacle. I wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it.\n\nThis occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old master, and under the following circumstances. Aunt Hester went out one night,—where or for what I do not know,—and happened to be absent when my master desired her presence. He had ordered her not to go out evenings, and warned her that she must never let him catch her in company with a young man, who was paying attention to her belonging to Colonel Lloyd. The young man’s name was Ned Roberts, generally called Lloyd’s Ned. Why master was so careful of her, may be safely left to conjecture. She was a woman of noble form, and of graceful proportions, having very few equals, and fewer superiors, in personal appearance, among the colored or white women of our neighborhood.\n\nAunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out, but had been found in company with Lloyd’s Ned; which circumstance, I found, from what he said while whipping her, was the chief offence. Had he been a man of pure morals himself, he might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew him will not suspect him of any such virtue. Before he commenced whipping Aunt Hester, he took her into the kitchen, and stripped her from neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely naked. He then told her to cross her hands, calling her at the same time a d——d b—-h. After crossing her hands, he tied them with a strong rope, and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put in for the purpose. He made her get upon the stool, and tied her hands to the hook. She now stood fair for his infernal purpose. Her arms were stretched up at their full length, so that she stood upon the ends of her toes. He then said to her, “Now, you d——d b—-h, I’ll learn you how to disobey my orders!” and after rolling up his sleeves, he commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood (amid heart-rending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to the floor. I was so terrified and horror-stricken at the sight, that I hid myself in a closet, and dared not venture out till long after the bloody transaction was over. I expected it would be my turn next. It was all new to me. I had never seen any thing like it before. I had always lived with my grandmother on the outskirts of the plantation, where she was put to raise the children of the younger women. I had therefore been, until now, out of the way of the bloody scenes that often occurred on the plantation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMy master’s family consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; one daughter, Lucretia, and her husband, Captain Thomas Auld. They lived in one house, upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd. My master was Colonel Lloyd’s clerk and superintendent. He was what might be called the overseer of the overseers. I spent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master’s family. It was here that I witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter; and as I received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation, I will give some description of it, and of slavery as it there existed. The plantation is about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is situated on the border of Miles River. The principal products raised upon it were tobacco, corn, and wheat. These were raised in great abundance; so that, with the products of this and the other farms belonging to him, he was able to keep in almost constant employment a large sloop, in carrying them to market at Baltimore. This sloop was named Sally Lloyd, in honor of one of the colonel’s daughters. My master’s son-in-law, Captain Auld, was master of the vessel; she was otherwise manned by the colonel’s own slaves. Their names were Peter, Isaac, Rich, and Jake. These were esteemed very highly by the other slaves, and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation; for it was no small affair, in the eyes of the slaves, to be allowed to see Baltimore.\n\nColonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation, and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him. The names of the farms nearest to the home plantation were Wye Town and New Design. “Wye Town” was under the overseership of a man named Noah Willis. New Design was under the overseership of a Mr. Townsend. The overseers of these, and all the rest of the farms, numbering over twenty, received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation. This was the great business place. It was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms. All disputes among the overseers were settled here. If a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a determination to run away, he was brought immediately here, severely whipped, put on board the sloop, carried to Baltimore, and sold to Austin Woolfolk, or some other slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves remaining.\n\nHere, too, the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance of food, and their yearly clothing. The men and women slaves received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal. Their yearly clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts, one pair of linen trousers, like the shirts, one jacket, one pair of trousers for winter, made of coarse negro cloth, one pair of stockings, and one pair of shoes; the whole of which could not have cost more than seven dollars. The allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers, or the old women having the care of them. The children unable to work in the field had neither shoes, stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to them; their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year. When these failed them, they went naked until the next allowance-day. Children from seven to ten years old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen at all seasons of the year.\n\nThere were no beds given the slaves, unless one coarse blanket be considered such, and none but the men and women had these. This, however, is not considered a very great privation. They find less difficulty from the want of beds, than from the want of time to sleep; for when their day’s work in the field is done, the most of them having their washing, mending, and cooking to do, and having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day; and when this is done, old and young, male and female, married and single, drop down side by side, on one common bed,—the cold, damp floor,—each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets; and here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver’s horn. At the sound of this, all must rise, and be off to the field. There must be no halting; every one must be at his or her post; and woe betides them who hear not this morning summons to the field; for if they are not awakened by the sense of hearing, they are by the sense of feeling: no age nor sex finds any favor. Mr. Severe, the overseer, used to stand by the door of the quarter, armed with a large hickory stick and heavy cowskin, ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not to hear, or, from any other cause, was prevented from being ready to start for the field at the sound of the horn.\n\nMr. Severe was rightly named: he was a cruel man. I have seen him whip a woman, causing the blood to run half an hour at the time; and this, too, in the midst of her crying children, pleading for their mother’s release. He seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his fiendish barbarity. Added to his cruelty, he was a profane swearer. It was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him talk. Scarce a sentence escaped him but that was commenced or concluded by some horrid oath. The field was the place to witness his cruelty and profanity. His presence made it both the field of blood and of blasphemy. From the rising till the going down of the sun, he was cursing, raving, cutting, and slashing among the slaves of the field, in the most frightful manner. His career was short. He died very soon after I went to Colonel Lloyd’s; and he died as he lived, uttering, with his dying groans, bitter curses and horrid oaths. His death was regarded by the slaves as the result of a merciful providence.\n\nMr. Severe’s place was filled by a Mr. Hopkins. He was a very different man. He was less cruel, less profane, and made less noise, than Mr. Severe. His course was characterized by no extraordinary demonstrations of cruelty. He whipped, but seemed to take no pleasure in it. He was called by the slaves a good overseer.\n\nThe home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appearance of a country village. All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here. The shoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing, cartwrighting, coopering, weaving, and grain-grinding, were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation. The whole place wore a business-like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms. The number of houses, too, conspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms. It was called by the slaves the Great House Farm. Few privileges were esteemed higher, by the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being selected to do errands at the Great House Farm. It was associated in their minds with greatness. A representative could not be prouder of his election to a seat in the American Congress, than a slave on one of the out-farms would be of his election to do errands at the Great House Farm. They regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their overseers; and it was on this account, as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver’s lash, that they esteemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living for. He was called the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor conferred upon him the most frequently. The competitors for this office sought as diligently to please their overseers, as the office-seekers in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people. The same traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd’s slaves, as are seen in the slaves of the political parties.\n\nThe slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm, for the monthly allowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves, were peculiarly enthusiastic. While on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness. They would compose and sing as they went along, consulting neither time nor tune. The thought that came up, came out—if not in the word, in the sound;—and as frequently in the one as in the other. They would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone. Into all of their songs they would manage to weave something of the Great House Farm. Especially would they do this, when leaving home. They would then sing most exultingly the following words:\n\n\n  \n    I am going away to the Great House Farm!\n    O, yea! O, yea!\n  \n\n\nThis they would sing, as a chorus, to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do.\n\nI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul,—and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because “there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.”\n\nI have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to find persons who could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their contentment and happiness. It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake. Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy. The songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. At least, such is my experience. I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to express my happiness. Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery. The singing of a man cast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as evidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nColonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded almost constant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener, (Mr. M’Durmond.) This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place. During the summer months, people came from far and near—from Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis—to see it. It abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south. This garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation. Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to the colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it. Scarcely a day passed, during the summer, but that some slave had to take the lash for stealing fruit. The colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden. The last and most successful one was that of tarring his fence all around; after which, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had tried to get in. In either case, he was severely whipped by the chief gardener. This plan worked well; the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the lash. They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching tar without being defiled.\n\nThe colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage. His stable and carriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments. His horses were of the finest form and noblest blood. His carriage-house contained three splendid coaches, three or four gigs, besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable style.\n\nThis establishment was under the care of two slaves—old Barney and young Barney—father and son. To attend to this establishment was their sole work. But it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses. The slightest inattention to these was unpardonable, and was visited upon those, under whose care they were placed, with the severest punishment; no excuse could shield them, if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses—a supposition which he frequently indulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old and young Barney a very trying one. They never knew when they were safe from punishment. They were frequently whipped when least deserving, and escaped whipping when most deserving it. Every thing depended upon the looks of the horses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd’s own mind when his horses were brought to him for use. If a horse did not move fast enough, or hold his head high enough, it was owing to some fault of his keepers. It was painful to stand near the stable-door, and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use. “This horse has not had proper attention. He has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried, or he has not been properly fed; his food was too wet or too dry; he got it too soon or too late; he was too hot or too cold; he had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he had too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old Barney’s attending to the horse, he had very improperly left it to his son.” To all these complaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never a word. Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave. When he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was literally the case. I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man between fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down upon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time. Colonel Lloyd had three sons—Edward, Murray, and Daniel,—and three sons-in-law, Mr. Winder, Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. All of these lived at the Great House Farm, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased, from old Barney down to William Wilkes, the coach-driver. I have seen Winder make one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his whip, and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back.\n\nTo describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to describing the riches of Job. He kept from ten to fifteen house-servants. He was said to own a thousand slaves, and I think this estimate quite within the truth. Colonel Lloyd owned so many that he did not know them when he saw them; nor did all the slaves of the out-farms know him. It is reported of him, that, while riding along the road one day, he met a colored man, and addressed him in the usual manner of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south: “Well, boy, whom do you belong to?” “To Colonel Lloyd,” replied the slave. “Well, does the colonel treat you well?” “No, sir,” was the ready reply. “What, does he work you too hard?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, don’t he give you enough to eat?” “Yes, sir, he gives me enough, such as it is.”\n\nThe colonel, after ascertaining where the slave belonged, rode on; the man also went on about his business, not dreaming that he had been conversing with his master. He thought, said, and heard nothing more of the matter, until two or three weeks afterwards. The poor man was then informed by his overseer that, for having found fault with his master, he was now to be sold to a Georgia trader. He was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus, without a moment’s warning, he was snatched away, and forever sundered, from his family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than death. This is the penalty of telling the truth, of telling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plain questions.\n\nIt is partly in consequence of such facts, that slaves, when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters, almost universally say they are contented, and that their masters are kind. The slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves, to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition. The frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head. They suppress the truth rather than take the consequences of telling it, and in so doing prove themselves a part of the human family. If they have any thing to say of their masters, it is generally in their masters’ favor, especially when speaking to an untried man. I have been frequently asked, when a slave, if I had a kind master, and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer; nor did I, in pursuing this course, consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false; for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders around us. Moreover, slaves are like other people, and imbibe prejudices quite common to others. They think their own better than that of others. Many, under the influence of this prejudice, think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and this, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters, each contending for the superior goodness of his own over that of the others. At the very same time, they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately. It was so on our plantation. When Colonel Lloyd’s slaves met the slaves of Jacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; Colonel Lloyd’s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr. Jepson’s slaves that he was the smartest, and most of a man. Colonel Lloyd’s slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson. Mr. Jepson’s slaves would boast his ability to whip Colonel Lloyd. These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties, and those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue. They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves. It was considered as being bad enough to be a slave; but to be a poor man’s slave was deemed a disgrace indeed!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMr. Hopkins remained but a short time in the office of overseer. Why his career was so short, I do not know, but suppose he lacked the necessary severity to suit Colonel Lloyd. Mr. Hopkins was succeeded by Mr. Austin Gore, a man possessing, in an eminent degree, all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer. Mr. Gore had served Colonel Lloyd, in the capacity of overseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown himself worthy of the high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm.\n\nMr. Gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering. He was artful, cruel, and obdurate. He was just the man for such a place, and it was just the place for such a man. It afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers, and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it. He was one of those who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly. There must be no answering back to him; no explanation was allowed a slave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused. Mr. Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,—”It is better that a dozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer should be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault.” No matter how innocent a slave might be—it availed him nothing, when accused by Mr. Gore of any misdemeanor. To be accused was to be convicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always following the other with immutable certainty. To escape punishment was to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either, under the overseership of Mr. Gore. He was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to crouch, himself, at the feet of the master. He was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition. He was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience. He was, of all the overseers, the most dreaded by the slaves. His presence was painful; his eye flashed confusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, without producing horror and trembling in their ranks.\n\nMr. Gore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he indulged in no jokes, said no funny words, seldom smiled. His words were in perfect keeping with his looks, and his looks were in perfect keeping with his words. Overseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word, even with the slaves; not so with Mr. Gore. He spoke but to command, and commanded but to be obeyed; he dealt sparingly with his words, and bountifully with his whip, never using the former where the latter would answer as well. When he whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences. He did nothing reluctantly, no matter how disagreeable; always at his post, never inconsistent. He never promised but to fulfil. He was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-like coolness.\n\nHis savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which he committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his charge. Mr. Gore once undertook to whip one of Colonel Lloyd’s slaves, by the name of Demby. He had given Demby but few stripes, when, to get rid of the scourging, he ran and plunged himself into a creek, and stood there at the depth of his shoulders, refusing to come out. Mr. Gore told him that he would give him three calls, and that, if he did not come out at the third call, he would shoot him. The first call was given. Demby made no response, but stood his ground. The second and third calls were given with the same result. Mr. Gore then, without consultation or deliberation with any one, not even giving Demby an additional call, raised his musket to his face, taking deadly aim at his standing victim, and in an instant poor Demby was no more. His mangled body sank out of sight, and blood and brains marked the water where he had stood.\n\nA thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation, excepting Mr. Gore. He alone seemed cool and collected. He was asked by Colonel Lloyd and my old master, why he resorted to this extraordinary expedient. His reply was, (as well as I can remember,) that Demby had become unmanageable. He was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves,—one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation. He argued that if one slave refused to be corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the enslavement of the whites. Mr. Gore’s defence was satisfactory. He was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation. His fame as an overseer went abroad. His horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation. It was committed in the presence of slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor testify against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives. Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael’s, Talbot county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he is still alive, he very probably lives there now; and if so, he is now, as he was then, as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not been stained with his brother’s blood.\n\nI speak advisedly when I say this,—that killing a slave, or any colored person, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by the courts or the community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, of St. Michael’s, killed two slaves, one of whom he killed with a hatchet, by knocking his brains out. He used to boast of the commission of the awful and bloody deed. I have heard him do so laughingly, saying, among other things, that he was the only benefactor of his country in the company, and that when others would do as much as he had done, we should be relieved of “the d——d niggers.”\n\nThe wife of Mr. Giles Hicks, living but a short distance from where I used to live, murdered my wife’s cousin, a young girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age, mangling her person in the most horrible manner, breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick, so that the poor girl expired in a few hours afterward. She was immediately buried, but had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken up and examined by the coroner, who decided that she had come to her death by severe beating. The offence for which this girl was thus murdered was this: She had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hicks’s baby, and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She, having lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear the crying. They were both in the room with Mrs. Hicks. Mrs. Hicks, finding the girl slow to move, jumped from her bed, seized an oak stick of wood by the fireplace, and with it broke the girl’s nose and breastbone, and thus ended her life. I will not say that this most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community. It did produce sensation, but not enough to bring the murderess to punishment. There was a warrant issued for her arrest, but it was never served. Thus she escaped not only punishment, but even the pain of being arraigned before a court for her horrid crime.\n\nWhilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, I will briefly narrate another, which occurred about the same time as the murder of Demby by Mr. Gore.\n\nColonel Lloyd’s slaves were in the habit of spending a part of their nights and Sundays in fishing for oysters, and in this way made up the deficiency of their scanty allowance. An old man belonging to Colonel Lloyd, while thus engaged, happened to get beyond the limits of Colonel Lloyd’s, and on the premises of Mr. Beal Bondly. At this trespass, Mr. Bondly took offence, and with his musket came down to the shore, and blew its deadly contents into the poor old man.\n\nMr. Bondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the next day, whether to pay him for his property, or to justify himself in what he had done, I know not. At any rate, this whole fiendish transaction was soon hushed up. There was very little said about it at all, and nothing done. It was a common saying, even among little white boys, that it was worth a half-cent to kill a “nigger,” and a half-cent to bury one.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAs to my own treatment while I lived on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, it was very similar to that of the other slave children. I was not old enough to work in the field, and there being little else than field work to do, I had a great deal of leisure time. The most I had to do was to drive up the cows at evening, keep the fowls out of the garden, keep the front yard clean, and run of errands for my old master’s daughter, Mrs. Lucretia Auld. The most of my leisure time I spent in helping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his birds, after he had shot them. My connection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me. He became quite attached to me, and was a sort of protector of me. He would not allow the older boys to impose upon me, and would divide his cakes with me.\n\nI was seldom whipped by my old master, and suffered little from any thing else than hunger and cold. I suffered much from hunger, but much more from cold. In hottest summer and coldest winter, I was kept almost naked—no shoes, no stockings, no jacket, no trousers, nothing on but a coarse tow linen shirt, reaching only to my knees. I had no bed. I must have perished with cold, but that, the coldest nights, I used to steal a bag which was used for carrying corn to the mill. I would crawl into this bag, and there sleep on the cold, damp, clay floor, with my head in and feet out. My feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes.\n\nWe were not regularly allowanced. Our food was coarse corn meal boiled. This was called mush. It was put into a large wooden tray or trough, and set down upon the ground. The children were then called, like so many pigs, and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush; some with oyster-shells, others with pieces of shingle, some with naked hands, and none with spoons. He that ate fastest got most; he that was strongest secured the best place; and few left the trough satisfied.\n\nI was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. I left it with joy. I shall never forget the ecstasy with which I received the intelligence that my old master (Anthony) had determined to let me go to Baltimore, to live with Mr. Hugh Auld, brother to my old master’s son-in-law, Captain Thomas Auld. I received this information about three days before my departure. They were three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed. I spent the most part of all these three days in the creek, washing off the plantation scurf, and preparing myself for my departure.\n\nThe pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own. I spent the time in washing, not so much because I wished to, but because Mrs. Lucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before I could go to Baltimore; for the people in Baltimore were very cleanly, and would laugh at me if I looked dirty. Besides, she was going to give me a pair of trousers, which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off me. The thought of owning a pair of trousers was great indeed! It was almost a sufficient motive, not only to make me take off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange, but the skin itself. I went at it in good earnest, working for the first time with the hope of reward.\n\nThe ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in my case. I found no severe trial in my departure. My home was charmless; it was not home to me; on parting from it, I could not feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by staying. My mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I seldom saw her. I had two sisters and one brother, that lived in the same house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories. I looked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving. If, however, I found in my new home hardship, hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by staying. Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master, and having endured them there, I very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb, that “being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death in Ireland.” I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. Cousin Tom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent description of the place. I could never point out any thing at the Great House, no matter how beautiful or powerful, but that he had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding, both in beauty and strength, the object which I pointed out to him. Even the Great House itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore. So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange. I left without a regret, and with the highest hopes of future happiness.\n\nWe sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning. I remember only the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of the month, nor the months of the year. On setting sail, I walked aft, and gave to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation what I hoped would be the last look. I then placed myself in the bows of the sloop, and there spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead, interesting myself in what was in the distance rather than in things near by or behind.\n\nIn the afternoon of that day, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the State. We stopped but a few moments, so that I had no time to go on shore. It was the first large town that I had ever seen, and though it would look small compared with some of our New England factory villages, I thought it a wonderful place for its size—more imposing even than the Great House Farm!\n\nWe arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning, landing at Smith’s Wharf, not far from Bowley’s Wharf. We had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep; and after aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse of Mr. Curtis on Louden Slater’s Hill, I was conducted by Rich, one of the hands belonging on board of the sloop, to my new home in Alliciana Street, near Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard, on Fells Point.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Auld were both at home, and met me at the door with their little son Thomas, to take care of whom I had been given. And here I saw what I had never seen before; it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions; it was the face of my new mistress, Sophia Auld. I wish I could describe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I beheld it. It was a new and strange sight to me, brightening up my pathway with the light of happiness. Little Thomas was told, there was his Freddy,—and I was told to take care of little Thomas; and thus I entered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheering prospect ahead.\n\nI look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd’s plantation as one of the most interesting events of my life. It is possible, and even quite probable, that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore, I should have to-day, instead of being here seated by my own table, in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home, writing this Narrative, been confined in the galling chains of slavery. Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity. I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors. I regarded the selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable. There were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore. There were those younger, those older, and those of the same age. I was chosen from among them all, and was the first, last, and only choice.\n\nI may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor. But I should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed the opinion. I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and incur my own abhorrence. From my earliest recollection, I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and in the darkest hours of my career in slavery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope departed not from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom. This good spirit was from God, and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise.\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nMy new mistress proved to be all she appeared when I first met her at the door,—a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings. She had never had a slave under her control previously to myself, and prior to her marriage she had been dependent upon her own industry for a living. She was by trade a weaver; and by constant application to her business, she had been in a good degree preserved from the blighting and dehumanizing effects of slavery. I was utterly astonished at her goodness. I scarcely knew how to behave towards her. She was entirely unlike any other white woman I had ever seen. I could not approach her as I was accustomed to approach other white ladies. My early instruction was all out of place. The crouching servility, usually so acceptable a quality in a slave, did not answer when manifested toward her. Her favor was not gained by it; she seemed to be disturbed by it. She did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her in the face. The meanest slave was put fully at ease in her presence, and none left without feeling better for having seen her. Her face was made of heavenly smiles, and her voice of tranquil music.\n\nBut, alas! this kind heart had but a short time to remain such. The fatal poison of irresponsible power was already in her hands, and soon commenced its infernal work. That cheerful eye, under the influence of slavery, soon became red with rage; that voice, made all of sweet accord, changed to one of harsh and horrid discord; and that angelic face gave place to that of a demon.\n\nVery soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she very kindly commenced to teach me the A, B, C. After I had learned this, she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters. Just at this point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave to read. To use his own words, further, he said, “If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world. Now,” said he, “if you teach that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master. As to himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm. It would make him discontented and unhappy.” These words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought. It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. It was just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected it. Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the merest accident, I had gained from my master. Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read. The very decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering. It gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which, he said, would flow from teaching me to read. What he most dreaded, that I most desired. What he most loved, that I most hated. That which to him was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn. In learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress. I acknowledge the benefit of both.\n\nI had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked difference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessed in the country. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on the plantation. He is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation. There is a vestige of decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation. He is a desperate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave. Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation of being a cruel master; and above all things, they would not be known as not giving a slave enough to eat. Every city slaveholder is anxious to have it known of him, that he feeds his slaves well; and it is due to them to say, that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat. There are, however, some painful exceptions to this rule. Directly opposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived Mr. Thomas Hamilton. He owned two slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary. Henrietta was about twenty-two years of age, Mary was about fourteen; and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon, these two were the most so. His heart must be harder than stone, that could look upon these unmoved. The head, neck, and shoulders of Mary were literally cut to pieces. I have frequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered with festering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel mistress. I do not know that her master ever whipped her, but I have been an eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton. I used to be in Mr. Hamilton’s house nearly every day. Mrs. Hamilton used to sit in a large chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin always by her side, and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood of one of these slaves. The girls seldom passed her without her saying, “Move faster, you black gip!” at the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawing the blood. She would then say, “Take that, you black gip!” continuing, “If you don’t move faster, I’ll move you!” Added to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected, they were kept nearly half-starved. They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal. I have seen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the street. So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces, that she was oftener called “pecked” than by her name.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nI lived in Master Hugh’s family about seven years. During this time, I succeeded in learning to read and write. In accomplishing this, I was compelled to resort to various stratagems. I had no regular teacher. My mistress, who had kindly commenced to instruct me, had, in compliance with the advice and direction of her husband, not only ceased to instruct, but had set her face against my being instructed by any one else. It is due, however, to my mistress to say of her, that she did not adopt this course of treatment immediately. She at first lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness. It was at least necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of irresponsible power, to make her equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute.\n\nMy mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband’s precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded; she seemed anxious to do better. Nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She seemed to think that here lay the danger. I have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension. She was an apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.\n\nFrom this time I was most narrowly watched. If I was in a separate room any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself. All this, however, was too late. The first step had been taken. Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the inch, and no precaution could prevent me from taking the ell.\n\nThe plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. “You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?” These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.\n\nI was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart. Just about this time, I got hold of a book entitled “The Columbian Orator.” Every opportunity I got, I used to read this book. Among much of other interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave was represented as having run away from his master three times. The dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them, when the slave was retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave. The slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master—things which had the desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.\n\nIn the same book, I met with one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation. These were choice documents to me. I read them over and over again with unabated interest. They gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance. The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder. What I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights. The reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the subject, behold! that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing. It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out. In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing, no matter what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm.\n\nI often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I should have killed myself, or done something for which I should have been killed. While in this state of mind, I was eager to hear any one speak of slavery. I was a ready listener. Every little while, I could hear something about the abolitionists. It was some time before I found what the word meant. It was always used in such connections as to make it an interesting word to me. If a slave ran away and succeeded in getting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set fire to a barn, or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spoken of as the fruit of abolition. Hearing the word in this connection very often, I set about learning what it meant. The dictionary afforded me little or no help. I found it was “the act of abolishing;” but then I did not know what was to be abolished. Here I was perplexed. I did not dare to ask any one about its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted me to know very little about. After a patient waiting, I got one of our city papers, containing an account of the number of petitions from the north, praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave trade between the States. From this time I understood the words abolition and abolitionist, and always drew near when that word was spoken, expecting to hear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves. The light broke in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on the wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I went, unasked, and helped them. When we had finished, one of them came to me and asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, “Are ye a slave for life?” I told him that I was. The good Irishman seemed to be deeply affected by the statement. He said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life. He said it was a shame to hold me. They both advised me to run away to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should be free. I pretended not to be interested in what they said, and treated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared they might be treacherous. White men have been known to encourage slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return them to their masters. I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and from that time I resolved to run away. I looked forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escape. I was too young to think of doing so immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I might have occasion to write my own pass. I consoled myself with the hope that I should one day find a good chance. Meanwhile, I would learn to write.\n\nThe idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being in Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship carpenters, after hewing, and getting a piece of timber ready for use, write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended. When a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side, it would be marked thus—”L.” When a piece was for the starboard side, it would be marked thus—”S.” A piece for the larboard side forward, would be marked thus—”L. F.” When a piece was for starboard side forward, it would be marked thus—”S. F.” For larboard aft, it would be marked thus—”L. A.” For starboard aft, it would be marked thus—”S. A.” I soon learned the names of these letters, and for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard. I immediately commenced copying them, and in a short time was able to make the four letters named. After that, when I met with any boy who I knew could write, I would tell him I could write as well as he. The next word would be, “I don’t believe you. Let me see you try it.” I would then make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask him to beat that. In this way I got a good many lessons in writing, which it is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way. During this time, my copy-book was the board fence, brick wall, and pavement; my pen and ink was a lump of chalk. With these, I learned mainly how to write. I then commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster’s Spelling Book, until I could make them all without looking on the book. By this time, my little Master Thomas had gone to school, and learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books. These had been brought home, and shown to some of our near neighbors, and then laid aside. My mistress used to go to class meeting at the Wilk Street meetinghouse every Monday afternoon, and leave me to take care of the house. When left thus, I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master Thomas’s copy-book, copying what he had written. I continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master Thomas. Thus, after a long, tedious effort for years, I finally succeeded in learning how to write.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nIn a very short time after I went to live at Baltimore, my old master’s youngest son Richard died; and in about three years and six months after his death, my old master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his son, Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to share his estate. He died while on a visit to see his daughter at Hillsborough. Cut off thus unexpectedly, he left no will as to the disposal of his property. It was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property, that it might be equally divided between Mrs. Lucretia and Master Andrew. I was immediately sent for, to be valued with the other property. Here again my feelings rose up in detestation of slavery. I had now a new conception of my degraded condition. Prior to this, I had become, if not insensible to my lot, at least partly so. I left Baltimore with a young heart overborne with sadness, and a soul full of apprehension. I took passage with Captain Rowe, in the schooner Wild Cat, and, after a sail of about twenty-four hours, I found myself near the place of my birth. I had now been absent from it almost, if not quite, five years. I, however, remembered the place very well. I was only about five years old when I left it, to go and live with my old master on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation; so that I was now between ten and eleven years old.\n\nWe were all ranked together at the valuation. Men and women, old and young, married and single, were ranked with horses, sheep, and swine. There were horses and men, cattle and women, pigs and children, all holding the same rank in the scale of being, and were all subjected to the same narrow examination. Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth, maids and matrons, had to undergo the same indelicate inspection. At this moment, I saw more clearly than ever the brutalizing effects of slavery upon both slave and slaveholder.\n\nAfter the valuation, then came the division. I have no language to express the high excitement and deep anxiety which were felt among us poor slaves during this time. Our fate for life was now to be decided. we had no more voice in that decision than the brutes among whom we were ranked. A single word from the white men was enough—against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties—to sunder forever the dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings. In addition to the pain of separation, there was the horrid dread of falling into the hands of Master Andrew. He was known to us all as being a most cruel wretch,—a common drunkard, who had, by his reckless mismanagement and profligate dissipation, already wasted a large portion of his father’s property. We all felt that we might as well be sold at once to the Georgia traders, as to pass into his hands; for we knew that that would be our inevitable condition,—a condition held by us all in the utmost horror and dread.\n\nI suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves. I had known what it was to be kindly treated; they had known nothing of the kind. They had seen little or nothing of the world. They were in very deed men and women of sorrow, and acquainted with grief. Their backs had been made familiar with the bloody lash, so that they had become callous; mine was yet tender; for while at Baltimore I got few whippings, and few slaves could boast of a kinder master and mistress than myself; and the thought of passing out of their hands into those of Master Andrew—a man who, but a few days before, to give me a sample of his bloody disposition, took my little brother by the throat, threw him on the ground, and with the heel of his boot stamped upon his head till the blood gushed from his nose and ears—was well calculated to make me anxious as to my fate. After he had committed this savage outrage upon my brother, he turned to me, and said that was the way he meant to serve me one of these days,—meaning, I suppose, when I came into his possession.\n\nThanks to a kind Providence, I fell to the portion of Mrs. Lucretia, and was sent immediately back to Baltimore, to live again in the family of Master Hugh. Their joy at my return equalled their sorrow at my departure. It was a glad day to me. I had escaped a worse than lion’s jaws. I was absent from Baltimore, for the purpose of valuation and division, just about one month, and it seemed to have been six.\n\nVery soon after my return to Baltimore, my mistress, Lucretia, died, leaving her husband and one child, Amanda; and in a very short time after her death, Master Andrew died. Now all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the hands of strangers,—strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it. Not a slave was left free. All remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest. If any one thing in my experience, more than another, served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery, and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to my poor old grandmother. She had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age. She had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she had become a great grandmother in his service. She had rocked him in infancy, attended him in childhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was nevertheless left a slave—a slave for life—a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her own destiny. And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having outlived my old master and all his children, having seen the beginning and end of all of them, and her present owners finding she was of but little value, her frame already racked with the pains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to die! If my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to suffer in utter loneliness; she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children, the loss of grandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren. They are, in the language of the slave’s poet, Whittier,\n\n\n  \n    Gone, gone, sold and gone\n    To the rice swamp dank and lone,\n    Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,\n    Where the noisome insect stings,\n    Where the fever-demon strews\n    Poison with the falling dews,\n    Where the sickly sunbeams glare\n    Through the hot and misty air:\n    Gone, gone, sold and gone\n    To the rice swamp dank and lone,\n    From Virginia hills and waters—\n    Woe is me, my stolen daughters!\n  \n\n\nThe hearth is desolate. The children, the unconscious children, who once sang and danced in her presence, are gone. She gropes her way, in the darkness of age, for a drink of water. Instead of the voices of her children, she hears by day the moans of the dove, and by night the screams of the hideous owl. All is gloom. The grave is at the door. And now, when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age, when the head inclines to the feet, when the beginning and ending of human existence meet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together—at this time, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a declining parent—my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve children, is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim embers. She stands—she sits—she staggers—she falls—she groans—she dies—and there are none of her children or grandchildren present, to wipe from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death, or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains. Will not a righteous God visit for these things?\n\nIn about two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas married his second wife. Her name was Rowena Hamilton. She was the eldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton. Master now lived in St. Michael’s. Not long after his marriage, a misunderstanding took place between himself and Master Hugh; and as a means of punishing his brother, he took me from him to live with himself at St. Michael’s. Here I underwent another most painful separation. It, however, was not so severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property; for, during this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and of slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; so that, as far as they were concerned, I thought I had little to lose by the change. But it was not to them that I was attached. It was to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the strongest attachment. I had received many good lessons from them, and was still receiving them, and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed. I was leaving, too, without the hope of ever being allowed to return. Master Thomas had said he would never let me return again. The barrier betwixt himself and brother he considered impassable.\n\nI then had to regret that I did not at least make the attempt to carry out my resolution to run away; for the chances of success are tenfold greater from the city than from the country.\n\nI sailed from Baltimore for St. Michael’s in the sloop Amanda, Captain Edward Dodson. On my passage, I paid particular attention to the direction which the steamboats took to go to Philadelphia. I found, instead of going down, on reaching North Point they went up the bay, in a north-easterly direction. I deemed this knowledge of the utmost importance. My determination to run away was again revived. I resolved to wait only so long as the offering of a favorable opportunity. When that came, I was determined to be off.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nI have now reached a period of my life when I can give dates. I left Baltimore, and went to live with Master Thomas Auld, at St. Michael’s, in March, 1832. It was now more than seven years since I lived with him in the family of my old master, on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. We of course were now almost entire strangers to each other. He was to me a new master, and I to him a new slave. I was ignorant of his temper and disposition; he was equally so of mine. A very short time, however, brought us into full acquaintance with each other. I was made acquainted with his wife not less than with himself. They were well matched, being equally mean and cruel. I was now, for the first time during a space of more than seven years, made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger—a something which I had not experienced before since I left Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. It went hard enough with me then, when I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a sufficiency. It was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh’s family, where I had always had enough to eat, and of that which was good. I have said Master Thomas was a mean man. He was so. Not to give a slave enough to eat, is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders. The rule is, no matter how coarse the food, only let there be enough of it. This is the theory; and in the part of Maryland from which I came, it is the general practice,—though there are many exceptions. Master Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food. There were four slaves of us in the kitchen—my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, and myself; and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week, and very little else, either in the shape of meat or vegetables. It was not enough for us to subsist upon. We were therefore reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors. This we did by begging and stealing, whichever came handy in the time of need, the one being considered as legitimate as the other. A great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger, when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house, and our pious mistress was aware of the fact; and yet that mistress and her husband would kneel every morning, and pray that God would bless them in basket and store!\n\nBad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect. My master was one of this rare sort. I do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him. The leading trait in his character was meanness; and if there were any other element in his nature, it was made subject to this. He was mean; and, like most other mean men, he lacked the ability to conceal his meanness. Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder. He had been a poor man, master only of a Bay craft. He came into possession of all his slaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst. He was cruel, but cowardly. He commanded without firmness. In the enforcement of his rules, he was at times rigid, and at times lax. At times, he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the fury of a demon; at other times, he might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his way. He did nothing of himself. He might have passed for a lion, but for his ears. In all things noble which he attempted, his own meanness shone most conspicuous. His airs, words, and actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders, and, being assumed, were awkward enough. He was not even a good imitator. He possessed all the disposition to deceive, but wanted the power. Having no resources within himself, he was compelled to be the copyist of many, and being such, he was forever the victim of inconsistency; and of consequence he was an object of contempt, and was held as such even by his slaves. The luxury of having slaves of his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for. He was a slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves. He found himself incapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud. We seldom called him “master;” we generally called him “Captain Auld,” and were hardly disposed to title him at all. I doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward, and of consequence fretful. Our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly. He wished to have us call him master, but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so. His wife used to insist upon our calling him so, but to no purpose. In August, 1832, my master attended a Methodist camp-meeting held in the Bay-side, Talbot county, and there experienced religion. I indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves, and that, if he did not do this, it would, at any rate, make him more kind and humane. I was disappointed in both these respects. It neither made him to be humane to his slaves, nor to emancipate them. If it had any effect on his character, it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways; for I believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before. Prior to his conversion, he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity; but after his conversion, he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty. He made the greatest pretensions to piety. His house was the house of prayer. He prayed morning, noon, and night. He very soon distinguished himself among his brethren, and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter. His activity in revivals was great, and he proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls. His house was the preachers’ home. They used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for while he starved us, he stuffed them. We have had three or four preachers there at a time. The names of those who used to come most frequently while I lived there, were Mr. Storks, Mr. Ewery, Mr. Humphry, and Mr. Hickey. I have also seen Mr. George Cookman at our house. We slaves loved Mr. Cookman. We believed him to be a good man. We thought him instrumental in getting Mr. Samuel Harrison, a very rich slaveholder, to emancipate his slaves; and by some means got the impression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves. When he was at our house, we were sure to be called in to prayers. When the others were there, we were sometimes called in and sometimes not. Mr. Cookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers. He could not come among us without betraying his sympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we had the sagacity to see it.\n\nWhile I lived with my master in St. Michael’s, there was a white young man, a Mr. Wilson, who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament. We met but three times, when Mr. West and Mr. Fairbanks, both class-leaders, with many others, came upon us with sticks and other missiles, drove us off, and forbade us to meet again. Thus ended our little Sabbath school in the pious town of St. Michael’s.\n\nI have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty. As an example, I will state one of many facts going to prove the charge. I have seen him tie up a lame young woman, and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders, causing the warm red blood to drip; and, in justification of the bloody deed, he would quote this passage of Scripture—”He that knoweth his master’s will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.”\n\nMaster would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situation four or five hours at a time. I have known him to tie her up early in the morning, and whip her before breakfast; leave her, go to his store, return at dinner, and whip her again, cutting her in the places already made raw with his cruel lash. The secret of master’s cruelty toward “Henny” is found in the fact of her being almost helpless. When quite a child, she fell into the fire, and burned herself horribly. Her hands were so burnt that she never got the use of them. She could do very little but bear heavy burdens. She was to master a bill of expense; and as he was a mean man, she was a constant offence to him. He seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence. He gave her away once to his sister; but, being a poor gift, she was not disposed to keep her. Finally, my benevolent master, to use his own words, “set her adrift to take care of herself.” Here was a recently-converted man, holding on upon the mother, and at the same time turning out her helpless child, to starve and die! Master Thomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very charitable purpose of taking care of them.\n\nMy master and myself had quite a number of differences. He found me unsuitable to his purpose. My city life, he said, had had a very pernicious effect upon me. It had almost ruined me for every good purpose, and fitted me for every thing which was bad. One of my greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away, and go down to his father-inlaw’s farm, which was about five miles from St. Michael’s. I would then have to go after it. My reason for this kind of carelessness, or carefulness, was, that I could always get something to eat when I went there. Master William Hamilton, my master’s father-in-law, always gave his slaves enough to eat. I never left there hungry, no matter how great the need of my speedy return. Master Thomas at length said he would stand it no longer. I had lived with him nine months, during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings, all to no good purpose. He resolved to put me out, as he said, to be broken; and, for this purpose, he let me for one year to a man named Edward Covey. Mr. Covey was a poor man, a farm-renter. He rented the place upon which he lived, as also the hands with which he tilled it. Mr. Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves, and this reputation was of immense value to him. It enabled him to get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could have had it done without such a reputation. Some slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow Mr. Covey to have their slaves one year, for the sake of the training to which they were subjected, without any other compensation. He could hire young help with great ease, in consequence of this reputation. Added to the natural good qualities of Mr. Covey, he was a professor of religion—a pious soul—a member and a class-leader in the Methodist church. All of this added weight to his reputation as a “nigger-breaker.” I was aware of all the facts, having been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there. I nevertheless made the change gladly; for I was sure of getting enough to eat, which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nI had left Master Thomas’s house, and went to live with Mr. Covey, on the 1st of January, 1833. I was now, for the first time in my life, a field hand. In my new employment, I found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city. I had been at my new home but one week before Mr. Covey gave me a very severe whipping, cutting my back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger. The details of this affair are as follows: Mr. Covey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of January, to the woods, to get a load of wood. He gave me a team of unbroken oxen. He told me which was the in-hand ox, and which the off-hand one. He then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox, and gave me the other end of it, and told me, if the oxen started to run, that I must hold on upon the rope. I had never driven oxen before, and of course I was very awkward. I, however, succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty; but I had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen took fright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and over stumps, in the most frightful manner. I expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees. After running thus for a considerable distance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with great force against a tree, and threw themselves into a dense thicket. How I escaped death, I do not know. There I was, entirely alone, in a thick wood, in a place new to me. My cart was upset and shattered, my oxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was none to help me. After a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cart righted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart. I now proceeded with my team to the place where I had, the day before, been chopping wood, and loaded my cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way to tame my oxen. I then proceeded on my way home. I had now consumed one half of the day. I got out of the woods safely, and now felt out of danger. I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate; and just as I did so, before I could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed through the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate-post. Thus twice, in one short day, I escaped death by the merest chance. On my return, I told Mr. Covey what had happened, and how it happened. He ordered me to return to the woods again immediately. I did so, and he followed on after me. Just as I got into the woods, he came up and told me to stop my cart, and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time, and break gates. He then went to a large gum-tree, and with his axe cut three large switches, and, after trimming them up neatly with his pocketknife, he ordered me to take off my clothes. I made him no answer, but stood with my clothes on. He repeated his order. I still made him no answer, nor did I move to strip myself. Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore off my clothes, and lashed me till he had worn out his switches, cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after. This whipping was the first of a number just like it, and for similar offences.\n\nI lived with Mr. Covey one year. During the first six months, of that year, scarce a week passed without his whipping me. I was seldom free from a sore back. My awkwardness was almost always his excuse for whipping me. We were worked fully up to the point of endurance. Long before day we were up, our horses fed, and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams. Mr. Covey gave us enough to eat, but scarce time to eat it. We were often less than five minutes taking our meals. We were often in the field from the first approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us; and at saving-fodder time, midnight often caught us in the field binding blades.\n\nCovey would be out with us. The way he used to stand it, was this. He would spend the most of his afternoons in bed. He would then come out fresh in the evening, ready to urge us on with his words, example, and frequently with the whip. Mr. Covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands. He was a hard-working man. He knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do. There was no deceiving him. His work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence; and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us. This he did by surprising us. He seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly, if he could do it secretly. He always aimed at taking us by surprise. Such was his cunning, that we used to call him, among ourselves, “the snake.” When we were at work in the cornfield, he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, “Ha, ha! Come, come! Dash on, dash on!” This being his mode of attack, it was never safe to stop a single minute. His comings were like a thief in the night. He appeared to us as being ever at hand. He was under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window, on the plantation. He would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to St. Michael’s, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching every motion of the slaves. He would, for this purpose, leave his horse tied up in the woods. Again, he would sometimes walk up to us, and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the house to get ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and there watch us till the going down of the sun.\n\nMr. Covey’s forte consisted in his power to deceive. His life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions. Every thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made conform to his disposition to deceive. He seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty. He would make a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem, few men would at times appear more devotional than he. The exercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he was a very poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me. He would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence. I would at times do so; at others, I would not. My non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion. To show himself independent of me, he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner. In this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit. Poor man! such was his disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery. The facts in the case are these: Mr. Covey was a poor man; he was just commencing in life; he was only able to buy one slave; and, shocking as is the fact, he bought her, as he said, for a breeder. This woman was named Caroline. Mr. Covey bought her from Mr. Thomas Lowe, about six miles from St. Michael’s. She was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old. She had already given birth to one child, which proved her to be just what he wanted. After buying her, he hired a married man of Mr. Samuel Harrison, to live with him one year; and him he used to fasten up with her every night! The result was, that, at the end of the year, the miserable woman gave birth to twins. At this result Mr. Covey seemed to be highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman. Such was his joy, and that of his wife, that nothing they could do for Caroline during her confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done. The children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth.\n\nIf at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey. We were worked in all weathers. It was never too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, hail, or snow, too hard for us to work in the field. Work, work, work, was scarcely more the order of the day than of the night. The longest days were too short for him, and the shortest nights too long for him. I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there, but a few months of this discipline tamed me. Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken in body, soul, and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!\n\nSunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times I would rise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul, accompanied with a faint beam of hope, that flickered for a moment, and then vanished. I sank down again, mourning over my wretched condition. I was sometimes prompted to take my life, and that of Covey, but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear. My sufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality.\n\nOur house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe. Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretched condition. I have often, in the deep stillness of a summer’s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. The sight of these always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compel utterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out my soul’s complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships:\n\n“You are loosed from your moorings, and are free; I am fast in my chains, and am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloody whip! You are freedom’s swift-winged angels, that fly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were free! O, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute! The glad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Why am I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get clear, I’ll try it. I had as well die with ague as the fever. I have only one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing. Only think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try it? Yes! God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave. I will take to the water. This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom. The steamboats steered in a north-east course from North Point. I will do the same; and when I get to the head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania. When I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; I can travel without being disturbed. Let but the first opportunity offer, and, come what will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke. I am not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as much as any of them. Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to some one. It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free. There is a better day coming.”\n\nThus I used to think, and thus I used to speak to myself; goaded almost to madness at one moment, and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot.\n\nI have already intimated that my condition was much worse, during the first six months of my stay at Mr. Covey’s, than in the last six. The circumstances leading to the change in Mr. Covey’s course toward me form an epoch in my humble history. You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man. On one of the hottest days of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave named Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat. Hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan. Eli was turning, Smith was feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. The work was simple, requiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused to such work, it came very hard. About three o’clock of that day, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb. Finding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do to stop work. I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with grain. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as if held down by an immense weight. The fan of course stopped; every one had his own work to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his own go on at the same time.\n\nMr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the treading-yard where we were fanning. On hearing the fan stop, he left immediately, and came to the spot where we were. He hastily inquired what the matter was. Bill answered that I was sick, and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan. I had by this time crawled away under the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed, hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun. He then asked where I was. He was told by one of the hands. He came to the spot, and, after looking at me awhile, asked me what was the matter. I told him as well as I could, for I scarce had strength to speak. He then gave me a savage kick in the side, and told me to get up. I tried to do so, but fell back in the attempt. He gave me another kick, and again told me to rise. I again tried, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but, stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan, I again staggered and fell. While down in this situation, Mr. Covey took up the hickory slat with which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure, and with it gave me a heavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and the blood ran freely; and with this again told me to get up. I made no effort to comply, having now made up my mind to let him do his worst. In a short time after receiving this blow, my head grew better. Mr. Covey had now left me to my fate. At this moment I resolved, for the first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his protection. In order to do this, I must that afternoon walk seven miles; and this, under the circumstances, was truly a severe undertaking. I was exceedingly feeble; made so as much by the kicks and blows which I received, as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been subjected. I, however, watched my chance, while Covey was looking in an opposite direction, and started for St. Michael’s. I succeeded in getting a considerable distance on my way to the woods, when Covey discovered me, and called after me to come back, threatening what he would do if I did not come. I disregarded both his calls and his threats, and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow; and thinking I might be overhauled by him if I kept the road, I walked through the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection, and near enough to prevent losing my way. I had not gone far before my little strength again failed me. I could go no farther. I fell down, and lay for a considerable time. The blood was yet oozing from the wound on my head. For a time I thought I should bleed to death; and think now that I should have done so, but that the blood so matted my hair as to stop the wound. After lying there about three quarters of an hour, I nerved myself up again, and started on my way, through bogs and briers, barefooted and bareheaded, tearing my feet sometimes at nearly every step; and after a journey of about seven miles, occupying some five hours to perform it, I arrived at master’s store. I then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart of iron. From the crown of my head to my feet, I was covered with blood. My hair was all clotted with dust and blood; my shirt was stiff with blood. I suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild beasts, and barely escaped them. In this state I appeared before my master, humbly entreating him to interpose his authority for my protection. I told him all the circumstances as well as I could, and it seemed, as I spoke, at times to affect him. He would then walk the floor, and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deserved it. He asked me what I wanted. I told him, to let me get a new home; that as sure as I lived with Mr. Covey again, I should live with but to die with him; that Covey would surely kill me; he was in a fair way for it. Master Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr. Covey’s killing me, and said that he knew Mr. Covey; that he was a good man, and that he could not think of taking me from him; that, should he do so, he would lose the whole year’s wages; that I belonged to Mr. Covey for one year, and that I must go back to him, come what might; and that I must not trouble him with any more stories, or that he would himself get hold of me. After threatening me thus, he gave me a very large dose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St. Michael’s that night, (it being quite late,) but that I must be off back to Mr. Covey’s early in the morning; and that if I did not, he would get hold of me, which meant that he would whip me. I remained all night, and, according to his orders, I started off to Covey’s in the morning, (Saturday morning,) wearied in body and broken in spirit. I got no supper that night, or breakfast that morning. I reached Covey’s about nine o’clock; and just as I was getting over the fence that divided Mrs. Kemp’s fields from ours, out ran Covey with his cowskin, to give me another whipping. Before he could reach me, I succeeded in getting to the cornfield; and as the corn was very high, it afforded me the means of hiding. He seemed very angry, and searched for me a long time. My behavior was altogether unaccountable. He finally gave up the chase, thinking, I suppose, that I must come home for something to eat; he would give himself no further trouble in looking for me. I spent that day mostly in the woods, having the alternative before me,—to go home and be whipped to death, or stay in the woods and be starved to death. That night, I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a slave with whom I was somewhat acquainted. Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr. Covey’s; and it being Saturday, he was on his way to see her. I told him my circumstances, and he very kindly invited me to go home with him. I went home with him, and talked this whole matter over, and got his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue. I found Sandy an old adviser. He told me, with great solemnity, I must go back to Covey; but that before I went, I must go with him into another part of the woods, where there was a certain root, which, if I would take some of it with me, carrying it always on my right side, would render it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me. He said he had carried it for years; and since he had done so, he had never received a blow, and never expected to while he carried it. I at first rejected the idea, that the simple carrying of a root in my pocket would have any such effect as he had said, and was not disposed to take it; but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness, telling me it could do no harm, if it did no good. To please him, I at length took the root, and, according to his direction, carried it upon my right side. This was Sunday morning. I immediately started for home; and upon entering the yard gate, out came Mr. Covey on his way to meeting. He spoke to me very kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by, and passed on towards the church. Now, this singular conduct of Mr. Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in the root which Sandy had given me; and had it been on any other day than Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than the influence of that root; and as it was, I was half inclined to think the root to be something more than I at first had taken it to be. All went well till Monday morning. On this morning, the virtue of the root was fully tested. Long before daylight, I was called to go and rub, curry, and feed, the horses. I obeyed, and was glad to obey. But whilst thus engaged, whilst in the act of throwing down some blades from the loft, Mr. Covey entered the stable with a long rope; and just as I was half out of the loft, he caught hold of my legs, and was about tying me. As soon as I found what he was up to, I gave a sudden spring, and as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the stable floor. Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do what he pleased; but at this moment—from whence came the spirit I don’t know—I resolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I seized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to me, and I to him. My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback. He trembled like a leaf. This gave me assurance, and I held him uneasy, causing the blood to run where I touched him with the ends of my fingers. Mr. Covey soon called out to Hughes for help. Hughes came, and, while Covey held me, attempted to tie my right hand. While he was in the act of doing so, I watched my chance, and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs. This kick fairly sickened Hughes, so that he left me in the hands of Mr. Covey. This kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes, but Covey also. When he saw Hughes bending over with pain, his courage quailed. He asked me if I meant to persist in my resistance. I told him I did, come what might; that he had used me like a brute for six months, and that I was determined to be used so no longer. With that, he strove to drag me to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door. He meant to knock me down. But just as he was leaning over to get the stick, I seized him with both hands by his collar, and brought him by a sudden snatch to the ground. By this time, Bill came. Covey called upon him for assistance. Bill wanted to know what he could do. Covey said, “Take hold of him, take hold of him!” Bill said his master hired him out to work, and not to help to whip me; so he left Covey and myself to fight our own battle out. We were at it for nearly two hours. Covey at length let me go, puffing and blowing at a great rate, saying that if I had not resisted, he would not have whipped me half so much. The truth was, that he had not whipped me at all. I considered him as getting entirely the worst end of the bargain; for he had drawn no blood from me, but I had from him. The whole six months afterwards, that I spent with Mr. Covey, he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger. He would occasionally say, he didn’t want to get hold of me again. “No,” thought I, “you need not; for you will come off worse than you did before.”\n\nThis battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave. It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived within me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed self-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be free. The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. He only can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has himself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never felt before. It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom. My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place; and I now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact. I did not hesitate to let it be known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me.\n\nFrom this time I was never again what might be called fairly whipped, though I remained a slave four years afterwards. I had several fights, but was never whipped.\n\nIt was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr. Covey did not immediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post, and there regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man in defence of myself. And the only explanation I can now think of does not entirely satisfy me; but such as it is, I will give it. Mr. Covey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a first-rate overseer and negro-breaker. It was of considerable importance to him. That reputation was at stake; and had he sent me—a boy about sixteen years old—to the public whipping-post, his reputation would have been lost; so, to save his reputation, he suffered me to go unpunished.\n\nMy term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day, 1833. The days between Christmas and New Year’s day are allowed as holidays; and, accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor, more than to feed and take care of the stock. This time we regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters; and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased. Those of us who had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society. This time, however, was spent in various ways. The staid, sober, thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets; and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares, and coons. But by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and drinking whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters. A slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them. He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master. It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he was regarded as lazy indeed, who had not provided himself with the necessary means, during the year, to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas.\n\nFrom what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave, I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection. Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice, I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves. These holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity. But for these, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the slaveholder, the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors! I warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in their midst, more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake.\n\nThe holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and inhumanity of slavery. They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave. They do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. This will be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning. Their object seems to be, to disgust their slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation. For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him drunk. One plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess. Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance, cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with the name of liberty. The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery. We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum. So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,—feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.\n\nI have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhumanity of slavery. It is so. The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse of it, is carried out in other things. For instance, a slave loves molasses; he steals some. His master, in many cases, goes off to town, and buys a large quantity; he returns, takes his whip, and commands the slave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it. The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance. A slave runs through his allowance, and applies for more. His master is enraged at him; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than is necessary, and compels him to eat it within a given time. Then, if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped for being hard to please! I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I have cited sufficient. The practice is a very common one.\n\nOn the first of January, 1834, I left Mr. Covey, and went to live with Mr. William Freeland, who lived about three miles from St. Michael’s. I soon found Mr. Freeland a very different man from Mr. Covey. Though not rich, he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman. Mr. Covey, as I have shown, was a well-trained negro-breaker and slave-driver. The former (slaveholder though he was) seemed to possess some regard for honor, some reverence for justice, and some respect for humanity. The latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments. Mr. Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders, such as being very passionate and fretful; but I must do him the justice to say, that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which Mr. Covey was constantly addicted. The one was open and frank, and we always knew where to find him. The other was a most artful deceiver, and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect his cunningly-devised frauds. Another advantage I gained in my new master was, he made no pretensions to, or profession of, religion; and this, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage. I assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes,—a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,—a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds,—and a dark shelter under, which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me. For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others. It was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in a community of such religionists. Very near Mr. Freeland lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden, and in the same neighborhood lived the Rev. Rigby Hopkins. These were members and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church. Mr. Weeden owned, among others, a woman slave, whose name I have forgotten. This woman’s back, for weeks, was kept literally raw, made so by the lash of this merciless, religious wretch. He used to hire hands. His maxim was, Behave well or behave ill, it is the duty of a master occasionally to whip a slave, to remind him of his master’s authority. Such was his theory, and such his practice.\n\nMr. Hopkins was even worse than Mr. Weeden. His chief boast was his ability to manage slaves. The peculiar feature of his government was that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it. He always managed to have one or more of his slaves to whip every Monday morning. He did this to alarm their fears, and strike terror into those who escaped. His plan was to whip for the smallest offences, to prevent the commission of large ones. Mr. Hopkins could always find some excuse for whipping a slave. It would astonish one, unaccustomed to a slaveholding life, to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things, of which to make occasion to whip a slave. A mere look, word, or motion,—a mistake, accident, or want of power,—are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied? It is said, he has the devil in him, and it must be whipped out. Does he speak loudly when spoken to by his master? Then he is getting high-minded, and should be taken down a button-hole lower. Does he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person? Then he is wanting in reverence, and should be whipped for it. Does he ever venture to vindicate his conduct, when censured for it? Then he is guilty of impudence,—one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty. Does he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed out by his master? He is indeed presumptuous, and getting above himself; and nothing less than a flogging will do for him. Does he, while ploughing, break a plough,—or, while hoeing, break a hoe? It is owing to his carelessness, and for it a slave must always be whipped. Mr. Hopkins could always find something of this sort to justify the use of the lash, and he seldom failed to embrace such opportunities. There was not a man in the whole county, with whom the slaves who had the getting their own home, would not prefer to live, rather than with this Rev. Mr. Hopkins. And yet there was not a man any where round, who made higher professions of religion, or was more active in revivals,—more attentive to the class, love-feast, prayer and preaching meetings, or more devotional in his family,—that prayed earlier, later, louder, and longer,—than this same reverend slave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.\n\nBut to return to Mr. Freeland, and to my experience while in his employment. He, like Mr. Covey, gave us enough to eat; but, unlike Mr. Covey, he also gave us sufficient time to take our meals. He worked us hard, but always between sunrise and sunset. He required a good deal of work to be done, but gave us good tools with which to work. His farm was large, but he employed hands enough to work it, and with ease, compared with many of his neighbors. My treatment, while in his employment, was heavenly, compared with what I experienced at the hands of Mr. Edward Covey.\n\nMr. Freeland was himself the owner of but two slaves. Their names were Henry Harris and John Harris. The rest of his hands he hired. These consisted of myself, Sandy Jenkins,* and Handy Caldwell.\n\nHenry and John were quite intelligent, and in a very little while after I went there, I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn how to read. This desire soon sprang up in the others also. They very soon mustered up some old spelling-books, and nothing would do but that I must keep a Sabbath school. I agreed to do so, and accordingly devoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to read. Neither of them knew his letters when I went there. Some of the slaves of the neighboring farms found what was going on, and also availed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read. It was understood, among all who came, that there must be as little display about it as possible. It was necessary to keep our religious masters at St. Michael’s unacquainted with the fact, that, instead of spending the Sabbath in wrestling, boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to learn how to read the will of God; for they had much rather see us engaged in those degrading sports, than to see us behaving like intellectual, moral, and accountable beings. My blood boils as I think of the bloody manner in which Messrs. Wright Fairbanks and Garrison West, both class-leaders, in connection with many others, rushed in upon us with sticks and stones, and broke up our virtuous little Sabbath school, at St. Michael’s—all calling themselves Christians! humble followers of the Lord Jesus Christ! But I am again digressing.\n\nI held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man, whose name I deem it imprudent to mention; for should it be known, it might embarrass him greatly, though the crime of holding the school was committed ten years ago. I had at one time over forty scholars, and those of the right sort, ardently desiring to learn. They were of all ages, though mostly men and women. I look back to those Sundays with an amount of pleasure not to be expressed. They were great days to my soul. The work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest engagement with which I was ever blessed. We loved each other, and to leave them at the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed. When I think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the prison-house of slavery, my feelings overcome me, and I am almost ready to ask, “Does a righteous God govern the universe? and for what does he hold the thunders in his right hand, if not to smite the oppressor, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler?” These dear souls came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so, nor did I teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged. Every moment they spent in that school, they were liable to be taken up, and given thirty-nine lashes. They came because they wished to learn. Their minds had been starved by their cruel masters. They had been shut up in mental darkness. I taught them, because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my race. I kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr. Freeland; and, beside my Sabbath school, I devoted three evenings in the week, during the winter, to teaching the slaves at home. And I have the happiness to know, that several of those who came to Sabbath school learned how to read; and that one, at least, is now free through my agency.\n\nThe year passed off smoothly. It seemed only about half as long as the year which preceded it. I went through it without receiving a single blow. I will give Mr. Freeland the credit of being the best master I ever had, till I became my own master. For the ease with which I passed the year, I was, however, somewhat indebted to the society of my fellow-slaves. They were noble souls; they not only possessed loving hearts, but brave ones. We were linked and interlinked with each other. I loved them with a love stronger than any thing I have experienced since. It is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in each other. In answer to this assertion, I can say, I never loved any or confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves, and especially those with whom I lived at Mr. Freeland’s. I believe we would have died for each other. We never undertook to do any thing, of any importance, without a mutual consultation. We never moved separately. We were one; and as much so by our tempers and dispositions, as by the mutual hardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as slaves.\n\nAt the close of the year 1834, Mr. Freeland again hired me of my master, for the year 1835. But, by this time, I began to want to live upon free land as well as with Freeland; and I was no longer content, therefore, to live with him or any other slaveholder. I began, with the commencement of the year, to prepare myself for a final struggle, which should decide my fate one way or the other. My tendency was upward. I was fast approaching manhood, and year after year had passed, and I was still a slave. These thoughts roused me—I must do something. I therefore resolved that 1835 should not pass without witnessing an attempt, on my part, to secure my liberty. But I was not willing to cherish this determination alone. My fellow-slaves were dear to me. I was anxious to have them participate with me in this, my life-giving determination. I therefore, though with great prudence, commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom. I bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape, and meanwhile strove, on all fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross fraud and inhumanity of slavery. I went first to Henry, next to John, then to the others. I found, in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits. They were ready to hear, and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed. This was what I wanted. I talked to them of our want of manhood, if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble effort to be free. We met often, and consulted frequently, and told our hopes and fears, recounted the difficulties, real and imagined, which we should be called on to meet. At times we were almost disposed to give up, and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot; at others, we were firm and unbending in our determination to go. Whenever we suggested any plan, there was shrinking—the odds were fearful. Our path was beset with the greatest obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it, our right to be free was yet questionable—we were yet liable to be returned to bondage. We could see no spot, this side of the ocean, where we could be free. We knew nothing about Canada. Our knowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York; and to go there, and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being returned to slavery—with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse than before—the thought was truly a horrible one, and one which it was not easy to overcome. The case sometimes stood thus: At every gate through which we were to pass, we saw a watchman—at every ferry a guard—on every bridge a sentinel—and in every wood a patrol. We were hemmed in upon every side. Here were the difficulties, real or imagined—the good to be sought, and the evil to be shunned. On the one hand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaring frightfully upon us,—its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions, and even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh. On the other hand, away back in the dim distance, under the flickering light of the north star, behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a doubtful freedom—half frozen—beckoning us to come and share its hospitality. This in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us; but when we permitted ourselves to survey the road, we were frequently appalled. Upon either side we saw grim death, assuming the most horrid shapes. Now it was starvation, causing us to eat our own flesh;—now we were contending with the waves, and were drowned;—now we were overtaken, and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound. We were stung by scorpions, chased by wild beasts, bitten by snakes, and finally, after having nearly reached the desired spot,—after swimming rivers, encountering wild beasts, sleeping in the woods, suffering hunger and nakedness,—we were overtaken by our pursuers, and, in our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot! I say, this picture sometimes appalled us, and made us\n\n\n  \n    rather bear those ills we had,\n    Than fly to others, that we knew not of.\n  \n\n\nIn coming to a fixed determination to run away, we did more than Patrick Henry, when he resolved upon liberty or death. With us it was a doubtful liberty at most, and almost certain death if we failed. For my part, I should prefer death to hopeless bondage.\n\nSandy, one of our number, gave up the notion, but still encouraged us. Our company then consisted of Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey, Charles Roberts, and myself. Henry Bailey was my uncle, and belonged to my master. Charles married my aunt: he belonged to my master’s father-in-law, Mr. William Hamilton.\n\nThe plan we finally concluded upon was, to get a large canoe belonging to Mr. Hamilton, and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays, paddle directly up the Chesapeake Bay. On our arrival at the head of the bay, a distance of seventy or eighty miles from where we lived, it was our purpose to turn our canoe adrift, and follow the guidance of the north star till we got beyond the limits of Maryland. Our reason for taking the water route was, that we were less liable to be suspected as runaways; we hoped to be regarded as fishermen; whereas, if we should take the land route, we should be subjected to interruptions of almost every kind. Any one having a white face, and being so disposed, could stop us, and subject us to examination.\n\nThe week before our intended start, I wrote several protections, one for each of us. As well as I can remember, they were in the following words, to wit:\n\n\n  This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my servant, full liberty to go to Baltimore, and spend the Easter holidays.\n\n  Written with mine own hand, &amp;c., 1835.\nWILLIAM HAMILTON,\n\n\n“Near St. Michael’s, in Talbot county, Maryland.”\n\nWe were not going to Baltimore; but, in going up the bay, we went toward Baltimore, and these protections were only intended to protect us while on the bay.\n\nAs the time drew near for our departure, our anxiety became more and more intense. It was truly a matter of life and death with us. The strength of our determination was about to be fully tested. At this time, I was very active in explaining every difficulty, removing every doubt, dispelling every fear, and inspiring all with the firmness indispensable to success in our undertaking; assuring them that half was gained the instant we made the move; we had talked long enough; we were now ready to move; if not now, we never should be; and if we did not intend to move now, we had as well fold our arms, sit down, and acknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves. This, none of us were prepared to acknowledge. Every man stood firm; and at our last meeting, we pledged ourselves afresh, in the most solemn manner, that, at the time appointed, we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom. This was in the middle of the week, at the end of which we were to be off. We went, as usual, to our several fields of labor, but with bosoms highly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardous undertaking. We tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible; and I think we succeeded very well.\n\nAfter a painful waiting, the Saturday morning, whose night was to witness our departure, came. I hailed it with joy, bring what of sadness it might. Friday night was a sleepless one for me. I probably felt more anxious than the rest, because I was, by common consent, at the head of the whole affair. The responsibility of success or failure lay heavily upon me. The glory of the one, and the confusion of the other, were alike mine. The first two hours of that morning were such as I never experienced before, and hope never to again. Early in the morning, we went, as usual, to the field. We were spreading manure; and all at once, while thus engaged, I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling, in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy, who was near by, and said, “We are betrayed!” “Well,” said he, “that thought has this moment struck me.” We said no more. I was never more certain of any thing.\n\nThe horn was blown as usual, and we went up from the field to the house for breakfast. I went for the form, more than for want of any thing to eat that morning. Just as I got to the house, in looking out at the lane gate, I saw four white men, with two colored men. The white men were on horseback, and the colored ones were walking behind, as if tied. I watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate. Here they halted, and tied the colored men to the gate-post. I was not yet certain as to what the matter was. In a few moments, in rode Mr. Hamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement. He came to the door, and inquired if Master William was in. He was told he was at the barn. Mr. Hamilton, without dismounting, rode up to the barn with extraordinary speed. In a few moments, he and Mr. Freeland returned to the house. By this time, the three constables rode up, and in great haste dismounted, tied their horses, and met Master William and Mr. Hamilton returning from the barn; and after talking awhile, they all walked up to the kitchen door. There was no one in the kitchen but myself and John. Henry and Sandy were up at the barn. Mr. Freeland put his head in at the door, and called me by name, saying, there were some gentlemen at the door who wished to see me. I stepped to the door, and inquired what they wanted. They at once seized me, and, without giving me any satisfaction, tied me—lashing my hands closely together. I insisted upon knowing what the matter was. They at length said, that they had learned I had been in a “scrape,” and that I was to be examined before my master; and if their information proved false, I should not be hurt.\n\nIn a few moments, they succeeded in tying John. They then turned to Henry, who had by this time returned, and commanded him to cross his hands. “I won’t!” said Henry, in a firm tone, indicating his readiness to meet the consequences of his refusal. “Won’t you?” said Tom Graham, the constable. “No, I won’t!” said Henry, in a still stronger tone. With this, two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols, and swore, by their Creator, that they would make him cross his hands or kill him. Each cocked his pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger, walked up to Henry, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his hands, they would blow his damned heart out. “Shoot me, shoot me!” said Henry; “you can’t kill me but once. Shoot, shoot,—and be damned! I won’t be tied!” This he said in a tone of loud defiance; and at the same time, with a motion as quick as lightning, he with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable. As he did this, all hands fell upon him, and, after beating him some time, they finally overpowered him, and got him tied.\n\nDuring the scuffle, I managed, I know not how, to get my pass out, and, without being discovered, put it into the fire. We were all now tied; and just as we were to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland, mother of William Freeland, came to the door with her hands full of biscuits, and divided them between Henry and John. She then delivered herself of a speech, to the following effect: addressing herself to me, she said, “You devil! You yellow devil! it was you that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run away. But for you, you long-legged mulatto devil! Henry nor John would never have thought of such a thing.” I made no reply, and was immediately hurried off towards St. Michael’s. Just a moment previous to the scuffle with Henry, Mr. Hamilton suggested the propriety of making a search for the protections which he had understood Frederick had written for himself and the rest. But, just at the moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect, his aid was needed in helping to tie Henry; and the excitement attending the scuffle caused them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under the circumstances, to search. So we were not yet convicted of the intention to run away.\n\nWhen we got about half way to St. Michael’s, while the constables having us in charge were looking ahead, Henry inquired of me what he should do with his pass. I told him to eat it with his biscuit, and own nothing; and we passed the word around, “Own nothing;” and “Own nothing!” said we all. Our confidence in each other was unshaken. We were resolved to succeed or fail together, after the calamity had befallen us as much as before. We were now prepared for any thing. We were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses, and then to be placed in the Easton jail. When we reached St. Michael’s, we underwent a sort of examination. We all denied that we ever intended to run away. We did this more to bring out the evidence against us, than from any hope of getting clear of being sold; for, as I have said, we were ready for that. The fact was, we cared but little where we went, so we went together. Our greatest concern was about separation. We dreaded that more than any thing this side of death. We found the evidence against us to be the testimony of one person; our master would not tell who it was; but we came to a unanimous decision among ourselves as to who their informant was. We were sent off to the jail at Easton. When we got there, we were delivered up to the sheriff, Mr. Joseph Graham, and by him placed in jail. Henry, John, and myself, were placed in one room together—Charles, and Henry Bailey, in another. Their object in separating us was to hinder concert.\n\nWe had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes, when a swarm of slave traders, and agents for slave traders, flocked into jail to look at us, and to ascertain if we were for sale. Such a set of beings I never saw before! I felt myself surrounded by so many fiends from perdition. A band of pirates never looked more like their father, the devil. They laughed and grinned over us, saying, “Ah, my boys! we have got you, haven’t we?” And after taunting us in various ways, they one by one went into an examination of us, with intent to ascertain our value. They would impudently ask us if we would not like to have them for our masters. We would make them no answer, and leave them to find out as best they could. Then they would curse and swear at us, telling us that they could take the devil out of us in a very little while, if we were only in their hands.\n\nWhile in jail, we found ourselves in much more comfortable quarters than we expected when we went there. We did not get much to eat, nor that which was very good; but we had a good clean room, from the windows of which we could see what was going on in the street, which was very much better than though we had been placed in one of the dark, damp cells. Upon the whole, we got along very well, so far as the jail and its keeper were concerned. Immediately after the holidays were over, contrary to all our expectations, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland came up to Easton, and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John, out of jail, and carried them home, leaving me alone. I regarded this separation as a final one. It caused me more pain than any thing else in the whole transaction. I was ready for any thing rather than separation. I supposed that they had consulted together, and had decided that, as I was the whole cause of the intention of the others to run away, it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty; and that they had, therefore, concluded to take the others home, and sell me, as a warning to the others that remained. It is due to the noble Henry to say, he seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home to come to the prison. But we knew we should, in all probability, be separated, if we were sold; and since he was in their hands, he concluded to go peaceably home.\n\nI was now left to my fate. I was all alone, and within the walls of a stone prison. But a few days before, and I was full of hope. I expected to have been safe in a land of freedom; but now I was covered with gloom, sunk down to the utmost despair. I thought the possibility of freedom was gone. I was kept in this way about one week, at the end of which, Captain Auld, my master, to my surprise and utter astonishment, came up, and took me out, with the intention of sending me, with a gentleman of his acquaintance, into Alabama. But, from some cause or other, he did not send me to Alabama, but concluded to send me back to Baltimore, to live again with his brother Hugh, and to learn a trade.\n\nThus, after an absence of three years and one month, I was once more permitted to return to my old home at Baltimore. My master sent me away, because there existed against me a very great prejudice in the community, and he feared I might be killed.\n\nIn a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me to Mr. William Gardner, an extensive ship-builder, on Fell’s Point. I was put there to learn how to calk. It, however, proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishment of this object. Mr. Gardner was engaged that spring in building two large man-of-war brigs, professedly for the Mexican government. The vessels were to be launched in the July of that year, and in failure thereof, Mr. Gardner was to lose a considerable sum; so that when I entered, all was hurry. There was no time to learn any thing. Every man had to do that which he knew how to do. In entering the shipyard, my orders from Mr. Gardner were, to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do. This was placing me at the beck and call of about seventy-five men. I was to regard all these as masters. Their word was to be my law. My situation was a most trying one. At times I needed a dozen pair of hands. I was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute. Three or four voices would strike my ear at the same moment. It was—”Fred., come help me to cant this timber here.”—”Fred., come carry this timber yonder.”—”Fred., bring that roller here.”—”Fred., go get a fresh can of water.”—”Fred., come help saw off the end of this timber.”—”Fred., go quick, and get the crowbar.”—”Fred., hold on the end of this fall.”—”Fred., go to the blacksmith’s shop, and get a new punch.”—”Hurra, Fred! run and bring me a cold chisel.”—”I say, Fred., bear a hand, and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that steam-box.”—”Halloo, nigger! come, turn this grindstone.”—”Come, come! move, move! and bowse this timber forward.”—”I say, darky, blast your eyes, why don’t you heat up some pitch?”—”Halloo! halloo! halloo!” (Three voices at the same time.) “Come here!—Go there!—Hold on where you are! Damn you, if you move, I’ll knock your brains out!”\n\nThis was my school for eight months; and I might have remained there longer, but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white apprentices, in which my left eye was nearly knocked out, and I was horribly mangled in other respects. The facts in the case were these: Until a very little while after I went there, white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it. All hands seemed to be very well satisfied. Many of the black carpenters were freemen. Things seemed to be going on very well. All at once, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they would not work with free colored workmen. Their reason for this, as alleged, was, that if free colored carpenters were encouraged, they would soon take the trade into their own hands, and poor white men would be thrown out of employment. They therefore felt called upon at once to put a stop to it. And, taking advantage of Mr. Gardner’s necessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless he would discharge his black carpenters. Now, though this did not extend to me in form, it did reach me in fact. My fellow-apprentices very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me. They began to put on airs, and talk about the “niggers” taking the country, saying we all ought to be killed; and, being encouraged by the journeymen, they commenced making my condition as hard as they could, by hectoring me around, and sometimes striking me. I, of course, kept the vow I made after the fight with Mr. Covey, and struck back again, regardless of consequences; and while I kept them from combining, I succeeded very well; for I could whip the whole of them, taking them separately. They, however, at length combined, and came upon me, armed with sticks, stones, and heavy handspikes. One came in front with a half brick. There was one at each side of me, and one behind me. While I was attending to those in front, and on either side, the one behind ran up with the handspike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the head. It stunned me. I fell, and with this they all ran upon me, and fell to beating me with their fists. I let them lay on for a while, gathering strength. In an instant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to my hands and knees. Just as I did that, one of their number gave me, with his heavy boot, a powerful kick in the left eye. My eyeball seemed to have burst. When they saw my eye closed, and badly swollen, they left me. With this I seized the handspike, and for a time pursued them. But here the carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as well give it up. It was impossible to stand my hand against so many. All this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one interposed a friendly word; but some cried, “Kill the damned nigger! Kill him! kill him! He struck a white person.” I found my only chance for life was in flight. I succeeded in getting away without an additional blow, and barely so; for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law,—and that was the law in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard; nor is there much of any other out of Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard.\n\nI went directly home, and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh; and I am happy to say of him, irreligious as he was, his conduct was heavenly, compared with that of his brother Thomas under similar circumstances. He listened attentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage, and gave many proofs of his strong indignation at it. The heart of my once overkind mistress was again melted into pity. My puffed-out eye and blood-covered face moved her to tears. She took a chair by me, washed the blood from my face, and, with a mother’s tenderness, bound up my head, covering the wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef. It was almost compensation for my suffering to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness from this, my once affectionate old mistress. Master Hugh was very much enraged. He gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed. As soon as I got a little the better of my bruises, he took me with him to Esquire Watson’s, on Bond Street, to see what could be done about the matter. Mr. Watson inquired who saw the assault committed. Master Hugh told him it was done in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard at midday, where there were a large company of men at work. “As to that,” he said, “the deed was done, and there was no question as to who did it.” His answer was, he could do nothing in the case, unless some white man would come forward and testify. He could issue no warrant on my word. If I had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people, their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers. Master Hugh, for once, was compelled to say this state of things was too bad. Of course, it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my behalf, and against the white young men. Even those who may have sympathized with me were not prepared to do this. It required a degree of courage unknown to them to do so; for just at that time, the slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism, and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities. The watchwords of the bloody-minded in that region, and in those days, were, “Damn the abolitionists!” and “Damn the niggers!” There was nothing done, and probably nothing would have been done if I had been killed. Such was, and such remains, the state of things in the Christian city of Baltimore.\n\nMaster Hugh, finding he could get no redress, refused to let me go back again to Mr. Gardner. He kept me himself, and his wife dressed my wound till I was again restored to health. He then took me into the ship-yard of which he was foreman, in the employment of Mr. Walter Price. There I was immediately set to calking, and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons. In the course of one year from the time I left Mr. Gardner’s, I was able to command the highest wages given to the most experienced calkers. I was now of some importance to my master. I was bringing him from six to seven dollars per week. I sometimes brought him nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and a half a day. After learning how to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own contracts, and collected the money which I earned. My pathway became much more smooth than before; my condition was now much more comfortable. When I could get no calking to do, I did nothing. During these leisure times, those old notions about freedom would steal over me again. When in Mr. Gardner’s employment, I was kept in such a perpetual whirl of excitement, I could think of nothing, scarcely, but my life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot my liberty. I have observed this in my experience of slavery,—that whenever my condition was improved, instead of its increasing my contentment, it only increased my desire to be free, and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom. I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceases to be a man.\n\nI was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day. I contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully my own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh. And why? Not because he earned it,—not because he had any hand in earning it,—not because I owed it to him,—nor because he possessed the slightest shadow of a right to it; but solely because he had the power to compel me to give it up. The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon the high seas is exactly the same.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nI now come to that part of my life during which I planned, and finally succeeded in making, my escape from slavery. But before narrating any of the peculiar circumstances, I deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction. My reasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following: First, were I to give a minute statement of all the facts, it is not only possible, but quite probable, that others would thereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties. Secondly, such a statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of course, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains. I deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience in slavery. It would afford me great pleasure indeed, as well as materially add to the interest of my narrative, were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity, which I know exists in the minds of many, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most fortunate escape. But I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford. I would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery.\n\nI have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted what they call the underground railroad, but which I think, by their open declarations, has been made most emphatically the upper-ground railroad. I honor those good men and women for their noble daring, and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves. I, however, can see very little good resulting from such a course, either to themselves or the slaves escaping; while, upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that those open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are seeking to escape. They do nothing towards enlightening the slave, whilst they do much towards enlightening the master. They stimulate him to greater watchfulness, and enhance his power to capture his slave. We owe something to the slave south of the line as well as to those north of it; and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from escaping from slavery. I would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. I would leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling prey. Let him be left to feel his way in the dark; let darkness commensurate with his crime hover over him; and let him feel that at every step he takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman, he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible agency. Let us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light by which he can trace the footprints of our flying brother. But enough of this. I will now proceed to the statement of those facts, connected with my escape, for which I am alone responsible, and for which no one can be made to suffer but myself.\n\nIn the early part of the year 1838, I became quite restless. I could see no reason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master. When I carried to him my weekly wages, he would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness, and ask, “Is this all?” He was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent. He would, however, when I made him six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. It had the opposite effect. I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole. The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to my mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them. I always felt worse for having received any thing; for I feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber. My discontent grew upon me. I was ever on the look-out for means of escape; and, finding no direct means, I determined to try to hire my time, with a view of getting money with which to make my escape. In the spring of 1838, when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to purchase his spring goods, I got an opportunity, and applied to him to allow me to hire my time. He unhesitatingly refused my request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape. He told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me; and that, in the event of my running away, he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me. He exhorted me to content myself, and be obedient. He told me, if I would be happy, I must lay out no plans for the future. He said, if I behaved myself properly, he would take care of me. Indeed, he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness. He seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, in order to contentment in slavery. But in spite of him, and even in spite of myself, I continued to think, and to think about the injustice of my enslavement, and the means of escape.\n\nAbout two months after this, I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege of hiring my time. He was not acquainted with the fact that I had applied to Master Thomas, and had been refused. He too, at first, seemed disposed to refuse; but, after some reflection, he granted me the privilege, and proposed the following terms: I was to be allowed all my time, make all contracts with those for whom I worked, and find my own employment; and, in return for this liberty, I was to pay him three dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools, and in board and clothing. My board was two dollars and a half per week. This, with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made my regular expenses about six dollars per week. This amount I was compelled to make up, or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time. Rain or shine, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must be forthcoming, or I must give up my privilege. This arrangement, it will be perceived, was decidedly in my master’s favor. It relieved him of all need of looking after me. His money was sure. He received all the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all the evils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman. I found it a hard bargain. But, hard as it was, I thought it better than the old mode of getting along. It was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman, and I was determined to hold on upon it. I bent myself to the work of making money. I was ready to work at night as well as day, and by the most untiring perseverance and industry, I made enough to meet my expenses, and lay up a little money every week. I went on thus from May till August. Master Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer. The ground for his refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay him for my week’s time. This failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore. During the week, I had entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from Baltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening; and being detained by my employer, I was unable to get down to Master Hugh’s without disappointing the company. I knew that Master Hugh was in no special need of the money that night. I therefore decided to go to camp meeting, and upon my return pay him the three dollars. I staid at the camp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left. But as soon as I returned, I called upon him to pay him what he considered his due. I found him very angry; he could scarce restrain his wrath. He said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping. He wished to know how I dared go out of the city without asking his permission. I told him I hired my time and while I paid him the price which he asked for it, I did not know that I was bound to ask him when and where I should go. This reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, he turned to me, and said I should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he should know of, I would be running away. Upon the same plea, he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith. I did so; but instead of seeking work, as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time, I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work. I did this in retaliation. Saturday night, he called upon me as usual for my week’s wages. I told him I had no wages; I had done no work that week. Here we were upon the point of coming to blows. He raved, and swore his determination to get hold of me. I did not allow myself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his hand upon me, it should be blow for blow. He did not strike me, but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future. I thought the matter over during the next day, Sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of September, as the day upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom. I now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey. Early on Monday morning, before Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me, I went out and got employment of Mr. Butler, at his ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon what is called the City Block, thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me. At the end of the week, I brought him between eight and nine dollars. He seemed very well pleased, and asked why I did not do the same the week before. He little knew what my plans were. My object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away; and in this I succeeded admirably. I suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which I was planning my escape. The second week passed, and again I carried him my full wages; and so well pleased was he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it. I told him I would.\n\nThings went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was trouble. It is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near. I had a number of warmhearted friends in Baltimore,—friends that I loved almost as I did my life,—and the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression. It is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery, who now remain, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends. The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which I had to contend. The love of them was my tender point, and shook my decision more than all things else. Besides the pain of separation, the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt. The appalling defeat I then sustained returned to torment me. I felt assured that, if I failed in this attempt, my case would be a hopeless one—it would seal my fate as a slave forever. I could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment, and being placed beyond the means of escape. It required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which I should have to pass, in case I failed. The wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were perpetually before me. It was life and death with me. But I remained firm, and, according to my resolution, on the third day of September, 1838, I left my chains, and succeeded in reaching New York without the slightest interruption of any kind. How I did so,—what means I adopted,—what direction I travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,—I must leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned.\n\nI have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State. I have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself. It was a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced. I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate. In writing to a dear friend, immediately after my arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions. This state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and I was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness. I was yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of slavery. This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm. But the loneliness overcame me. There I was in the midst of thousands, and yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the midst of thousands of my own brethren—children of a common Father, and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition. I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one, and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers, whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey. The motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this—”Trust no man!” I saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust. It was a most painful situation; and, to understand it, one must needs experience it, or imagine himself in similar circumstances. Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land—a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders—whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers—where he is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen, as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey!—I say, let him place himself in my situation—without home or friends—without money or credit—wanting shelter, and no one to give it—wanting bread, and no money to buy it,—and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do, where to go, or where to stay,—perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape,—in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger,—in the midst of houses, yet having no home,—among fellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist,—I say, let him be placed in this most trying situation,—the situation in which I was placed,—then, and not till then, will he fully appreciate the hardships of, and know how to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.\n\nThank Heaven, I remained but a short time in this distressed situation. I was relieved from it by the humane hand of Mr. David Ruggles, whose vigilance, kindness, and perseverance, I shall never forget. I am glad of an opportunity to express, as far as words can, the love and gratitude I bear him. Mr. Ruggles is now afflicted with blindness, and is himself in need of the same kind offices which he was once so forward in the performance of toward others. I had been in New York but a few days, when Mr. Ruggles sought me out, and very kindly took me to his boarding-house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets. Mr. Ruggles was then very deeply engaged in the memorable Darg case, as well as attending to a number of other fugitive slaves, devising ways and means for their successful escape; and, though watched and hemmed in on almost every side, he seemed to be more than a match for his enemies.\n\nVery soon after I went to Mr. Ruggles, he wished to know of me where I wanted to go; as he deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York. I told him I was a calker, and should like to go where I could get work. I thought of going to Canada; but he decided against it, and in favor of my going to New Bedford, thinking I should be able to get work there at my trade. At this time, Anna,* my intended wife, came on; for I wrote to her immediately after my arrival at New York, (notwithstanding my homeless, houseless, and helpless condition,) informing her of my successful flight, and wishing her to come on forthwith. In a few days after her arrival, Mr. Ruggles called in the Rev. J. W. C. Pennington, who, in the presence of Mr. Ruggles, Mrs. Michaels, and two or three others, performed the marriage ceremony, and gave us a certificate, of which the following is an exact copy:\n\n\n  This may certify, that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick Johnson* and Anna Murray, as man and wife, in the presence of Mr. David Ruggles and Mrs. Michaels.\n\n  JAMES W. C. PENNINGTON\nNew York, Sept. 15, 1838\n\n\nUpon receiving this certificate, and a five-dollar bill from Mr. Ruggles, I shouldered one part of our baggage, and Anna took up the other, and we set out forthwith to take passage on board of the steamboat John W. Richmond for Newport, on our way to New Bedford. Mr. Ruggles gave me a letter to a Mr. Shaw in Newport, and told me, in case my money did not serve me to New Bedford, to stop in Newport and obtain further assistance; but upon our arrival at Newport, we were so anxious to get to a place of safety, that, notwithstanding we lacked the necessary money to pay our fare, we decided to take seats in the stage, and promise to pay when we got to New Bedford. We were encouraged to do this by two excellent gentlemen, residents of New Bedford, whose names I afterward ascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C. Taber. They seemed at once to understand our circumstances, and gave us such assurance of their friendliness as put us fully at ease in their presence.\n\nIt was good indeed to meet with such friends, at such a time. Upon reaching New Bedford, we were directed to the house of Mr. Nathan Johnson, by whom we were kindly received, and hospitably provided for. Both Mr. and Mrs. Johnson took a deep and lively interest in our welfare. They proved themselves quite worthy of the name of abolitionists. When the stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare, he held on upon our baggage as security for the debt. I had but to mention the fact to Mr. Johnson, and he forthwith advanced the money.\n\nWe now began to feel a degree of safety, and to prepare ourselves for the duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom. On the morning after our arrival at New Bedford, while at the breakfast-table, the question arose as to what name I should be called by. The name given me by my mother was, “Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.” I, however, had dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so that I was generally known by the name of “Frederick Bailey.” I started from Baltimore bearing the name of “Stanley.” When I got to New York, I again changed my name to “Frederick Johnson,” and thought that would be the last change. But when I got to New Bedford, I found it necessary again to change my name. The reason of this necessity was, that there were so many Johnsons in New Bedford, it was already quite difficult to distinguish between them. I gave Mr. Johnson the privilege of choosing me a name, but told him he must not take from me the name of “Frederick.” I must hold on to that, to preserve a sense of my identity. Mr. Johnson had just been reading the “Lady of the Lake,” and at once suggested that my name be “Douglass.” From that time until now I have been called “Frederick Douglass;” and as I am more widely known by that name than by either of the others, I shall continue to use it as my own.\n\nI was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford. The impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly erroneous. I had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south. I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves. I supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south. I knew they were exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders. I had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refinement. And upon coming to the north, I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders. Such being my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake.\n\nIn the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the wharves, to take a view of the shipping. Here I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth. Lying at the wharves, and riding in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order, and of the largest size. Upon the right and left, I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life. Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer. I saw no whipping of men; but all seemed to go smoothly on. Every man appeared to understand his work, and went at it with a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man. To me this looked exceedingly strange. From the wharves I strolled around and over the town, gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautiful dwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth, comfort, taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding Maryland.\n\nEvery thing looked clean, new, and beautiful. I saw few or no dilapidated houses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked children and barefooted women, such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough, Easton, St. Michael’s, and Baltimore. The people looked more able, stronger, healthier, and happier, than those of Maryland. I was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty. But the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men. I found many, who had not been seven years out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders in Maryland. I will venture to assert, that my friend Mr. Nathan Johnson (of whom I can say with a grateful heart, “I was hungry, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink; I was a stranger, and he took me in”) lived in a neater house; dined at a better table; took, paid for, and read, more newspapers; better understood the moral, religious, and political character of the nation,—than nine tenths of the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland. Yet Mr. Johnson was a working man. His hands were hardened by toil, and not his alone, but those also of Mrs. Johnson. I found the colored people much more spirited than I had supposed they would be. I found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper, at all hazards. Soon after my arrival, I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit. A colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms. The former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts. Straightway a meeting was called among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice, “Business of importance!” The betrayer was invited to attend. The people came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe, made a prayer, after which he addressed the meeting as follows: “Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door, and kill him!” With this, a number of them bolted at him; but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not been seen in New Bedford since. I believe there have been no more such threats, and should there be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be the consequence.\n\nI found employment, the third day after my arrival, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil. It was new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went at it with a glad heart and a willing hand. I was now my own master. It was a happy moment, the rapture of which can be understood only by those who have been slaves. It was the first work, the reward of which was to be entirely my own. There was no Master Hugh standing ready, the moment I earned the money, to rob me of it. I worked that day with a pleasure I had never before experienced. I was at work for myself and newly-married wife. It was to me the starting-point of a new existence. When I got through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job of calking; but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among the white calkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I could get no employment.*\n\nFinding my trade of no immediate benefit, I threw off my calking habiliments, and prepared myself to do any kind of work I could get to do. Mr. Johnson kindly let me have his wood-horse and saw, and I very soon found myself a plenty of work. There was no work too hard—none too dirty. I was ready to saw wood, shovel coal, carry wood, sweep the chimney, or roll oil casks,—all of which I did for nearly three years in New Bedford, before I became known to the anti-slavery world.\n\nIn about four months after I went to New Bedford, there came a young man to me, and inquired if I did not wish to take the “Liberator.” I told him I did; but, just having made my escape from slavery, I remarked that I was unable to pay for it then. I, however, finally became a subscriber to it. The paper came, and I read it from week to week with such feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to describe. The paper became my meat and my drink. My soul was set all on fire. Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds—its scathing denunciations of slaveholders—its faithful exposures of slavery—and its powerful attacks upon the upholders of the institution—sent a thrill of joy through my soul, such as I had never felt before!\n\nI had not long been a reader of the “Liberator,” before I got a pretty correct idea of the principles, measures and spirit of the anti-slavery reform. I took right hold of the cause. I could do but little; but what I could, I did with a joyful heart, and never felt happier than when in an anti-slavery meeting. I seldom had much to say at the meetings, because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others. But, while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket, on the 11th of August, 1841, I felt strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time much urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a gentleman who had heard me speak in the colored people’s meeting at New Bedford. It was a severe cross, and I took it up reluctantly. The truth was, I felt myself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down. I spoke but a few moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and said what I desired with considerable ease. From that time until now, I have been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren—with what success, and with what devotion, I leave those acquainted with my labors to decide.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nI find, since reading over the foregoing Narrative, that I have, in several instances, spoken in such a tone and manner, respecting religion, as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion. To remove the liability of such misapprehension, I deem it proper to append the following brief explanation. What I have said respecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply to the slaveholding religion of this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper; for, between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference—so wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of “stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.” I am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround me. We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members. The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus. The man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a class-leader on Sunday morning, to show me the way of life, and the path of salvation. He who sells my sister, for purposes of prostitution, stands forth as the pious advocate of purity. He who proclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of learning to read the name of the God who made me. He who is the religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred influence, and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution. The warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that scatters whole families,—sundering husbands and wives, parents and children, sisters and brothers,—leaving the hut vacant, and the hearth desolate. We see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer against adultery. We have men sold to build churches, women sold to support the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the Poor Heathen! All For The Glory Of God And The Good Of Souls! The slave auctioneer’s bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the church stand near each other. The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church, may be heard at the same time. The dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.\n\n\n  \n    Just God! and these are they,\n    Who minister at thine altar, God of right!\n    Men who their hands, with prayer and blessing, lay\n    On Israel’s ark of light.\n  \n\n\n  \n    What! preach, and kidnap men?\n    Give thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?\n    Talk of thy glorious liberty, and then\n    Bolt hard the captive’s door?\n  \n\n\n  \n    What! servants of thy own\n    Merciful Son, who came to seek and save\n    The homeless and the outcast, fettering down\n    The tasked and plundered slave!\n  \n\n\n  \n    Pilate and Herod friends!\n    Chief priests and rulers, as of old, combine!\n    Just God and holy! is that church which lends\n    Strength to the spoiler thine?”\n  \n\n\nThe Christianity of America is a Christianity, of whose votaries it may be as truly said, as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees, “They bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. All their works they do for to be seen of men.—They love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, . . . . . . and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.—But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.—Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but within, they are full of extortion and excess.—Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.”\n\nDark and terrible as is this picture, I hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America. They strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Could any thing be more true of our churches? They would be shocked at the proposition of fellowshipping a sheep-stealer; and at the same time they hug to their communion a man-stealer, and brand me with being an infidel, if I find fault with them for it. They attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward forms of religion, and at the same time neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. They are always ready to sacrifice, but seldom to show mercy. They are they who are represented as professing to love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate their brother whom they have seen. They love the heathen on the other side of the globe. They can pray for him, pay money to have the Bible put into his hand, and missionaries to instruct him; while they despise and totally neglect the heathen at their own doors.\n\nSuch is, very briefly, my view of the religion of this land; and to avoid any misunderstanding, growing out of the use of general terms, I mean by the religion of this land, that which is revealed in the words, deeds, and actions, of those bodies, north and south, calling themselves Christian churches, and yet in union with slaveholders. It is against religion, as presented by these bodies, that I have felt it my duty to testify.\n\nI conclude these remarks by copying the following portrait of the religion of the south, (which is, by communion and fellowship, the religion of the north,) which I soberly affirm is “true to the life,” and without caricature or the slightest exaggeration. It is said to have been drawn, several years before the present anti-slavery agitation began, by a northern Methodist preacher, who, while residing at the south, had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals, manners, and piety, with his own eyes. “Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?”\n\n\n\nA PARODY\n\n\n  \n    Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell\n    How pious priests whip Jack and Nell,\n    And women buy and children sell,\n    And preach all sinners down to hell,\n    And sing of heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    They’ll bleat and baa, dona like goats,\n    Gorge down black sheep, and strain at motes,\n    Array their backs in fine black coats,\n    Then seize their negroes by their throats,\n    And choke, for heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    They’ll church you if you sip a dram,\n    And damn you if you steal a lamb;\n    Yet rob old Tony, Doll, and Sam,\n    Of human rights, and bread and ham;\n    Kidnapper’s heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    They’ll loudly talk of Christ’s reward,\n    And bind his image with a cord,\n    And scold, and swing the lash abhorred,\n    And sell their brother in the Lord\n    To handcuffed heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    They’ll read and sing a sacred song,\n    And make a prayer both loud and long,\n    And teach the right and do the wrong,\n    Hailing the brother, sister throng,\n    With words of heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    We wonder how such saints can sing,\n    Or praise the Lord upon the wing,\n    Who roar, and scold, and whip, and sting,\n    And to their slaves and mammon cling,\n    In guilty conscience union.\n  \n  \n    They’ll raise tobacco, corn, and rye,\n    And drive, and thieve, and cheat, and lie,\n    And lay up treasures in the sky,\n    By making switch and cowskin fly,\n    In hope of heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    They’ll crack old Tony on the skull,\n    And preach and roar like Bashan bull,\n    Or braying ass, of mischief full,\n    Then seize old Jacob by the wool,\n    And pull for heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    A roaring, ranting, sleek man-thief,\n    Who lived on mutton, veal, and beef,\n    Yet never would afford relief\n    To needy, sable sons of grief,\n    Was big with heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    ‘Love not the world,’ the preacher said,\n    And winked his eye, and shook his head;\n    He seized on Tom, and Dick, and Ned,\n    Cut short their meat, and clothes, and bread,\n    Yet still loved heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    Another preacher whining spoke\n    Of One whose heart for sinners broke:\n    He tied old Nanny to an oak,\n    And drew the blood at every stroke,\n    And prayed for heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    Two others oped their iron jaws,\n    And waved their children-stealing paws;\n    There sat their children in gewgaws;\n    By stinting negroes’ backs and maws,\n    They kept up heavenly union.\n  \n  \n    All good from Jack another takes,\n    And entertains their flirts and rakes,\n    Who dress as sleek as glossy snakes,\n    And cram their mouths with sweetened cakes;\n    And this goes down for union.\n  \n\n\nSincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book may do something toward throwing light on the American slave system, and hastening the glad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in bonds—faithfully relying upon the power of truth, love, and justice, for success in my humble efforts—and solemnly pledging my self anew to the sacred cause,—I subscribe myself,\n\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS.\nLYNN, Mass., April 28, 1845.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n[Footnotes by Frederick Douglass]\n\n\n\n* This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my being whipped by Mr. Covey. He was “a clever soul.” We used frequently to talk about the fight with Covey, and as often as we did so, he would claim my success as the result of the roots which he gave me. This superstition is very common among the more ignorant slaves. A slave seldom dies but that his death is attributed to trickery. ↩︎\n\n* She was free. ↩︎\n\n* I had changed my name from Frederick Bailey to that of Johnson. ↩︎\n\n* I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking in New Bedford—a result of anti-slavery effort. ↩︎\n",
