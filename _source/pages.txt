 T  HE peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
    FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest materials, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,

  GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
   These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling a t a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
         T H E EIDER D O W N QUILT,
also, is to be seen on@ a t their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
 Qarriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                       BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, WITH PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable-
   OLD FEATHER-BEDS re-dressed by this process are perfectly freed from all
impurities ; and, by expanding the Feathers, the bulk is greatly increased, and the
Bed consequently rendered much fuller and softer, a t 3d. per lb.
  OLD AND MOTHY MATTRESSES effectually cured and re-made.

                                 BY DR. WILLIAM SMITH.
                         Complete in Three Volumes medium Svo, f 5 15s. 6d. cloth lettered.
   "The book i s condensed well-digested, well-proportioned, and, considering the extent of subject wonderfully
complete. There is nothin; superfluous either in matter or style. There was too much to be said,'and too little
space to put i t in, to allow the privilege of diffuseness t o a n y of the writers. The hook is the reverse of pedanticsl or
merely scholastic i n its tone, and is in fact designed for every class of readers. Whether the school-boy seeks his
first acquaintance with its historicaiand mithic personages, or the student desires larger views to correct his first
impressions, or the man of more mature years would recall the knowledge of his youth to obtain examples and com-
parisons for the business of life, the Dictionary will be acceptable to all. W e can imagine no one from whom it does
not challenge eager welcome."-Examiner.

    Lastly, that description of Domestic and Political News is introduced which is usually found in a
 Weekly Newspaper. It is unnecessary to dwell on this head further than to say, that the proprietor^ do not
 range themselves under the banners of any Party ; their earnest endeavours are to make THE GARDENEES'
 CHRONICLE     AND AORICULTURAL           GAZETTE   a full and comprehensive Record of Facts only-a Newspaper in the
 true sense of the word-leaving the Reader to form his own opinions; their object being the elucidation of the
 laws of Nature, not of Man. The Reader is thus furnished, in addition to the peculiar features of
 the Journal with such Information concerning the events of the day, as supersedes the necessity of hls
 providing himsklf with any other Weekly Paper.

Experience, extending over twenty years, enables them to o5er many advantagesin quality and price. I n large
Mercantile Establishments, the Stationery Department, whilst i t involves a considerable outlay, and interferes
greatly with the comfort of those employed, seldom receives the attention which its importance demands,
from the fact of few Stationers having combined under one Establishment, Printing i n LETTER-PRESS.
LITHOGRAPHY and COPPER-PLATE, the Manufacture of ACCOUNT-BOOKS, and the supply of the more
minute articles for the Office, in addition to the various descriptions of Paper.
   NISSEN & PARKER, with a thorough knowledge of the trade, executing every branch on the Premises, beg
respectfully t o state,that all business entrusted t o their care will receive(f0r the smallest order)the most strict
attention; any article not thoroughly approved i s immediately exchanged, and in all cases the utmost exertion
used t o give satisfaction. The extraordinary fact, that upwards of One Thousand Banking and Mercantile
Firms have openedaccounts with this Establishment i n the short space of four years, IS submitted a s a guarantee
for the mode in which the business i s carried out.

                                  BANKERS' CHEQUES.
   NISSEN & PARKER solicit inspection of their Printing for BANKCHEQUES,                  On terms considerably lower
than any that have yet been offered by the trade. The enormous prices that have been kept up by the London
houses have long been a n objection in establishments where the cousumptlon of Cheques and Credit Letters
is e x t e h v e ; and in thus striking a t the root of an evil that has hitherto met with but little opposition, Nlsssn
&PARKER humbly solicit a small portion of public patronage, assuring those houses who may favour them
with their confidence, that all orders will be executed with the greatest dispatch, and with strict attention to
the beauty of the work, and also with a desire t o exchange or take back,all goods that may not meet with
thorough approbation.-Upwards of one hundred banking-houses are supphed from thls establishment.

   The Directors have much pleasure i n laying before the Members, in their Thirteenth Annual Report, the following
statement of the business of the Institution during the past year :-
   In that period 1673 proposals for assurance have been submitted to the Board ; of these. 1423 have been accepted,
and policies thereonissued, the annual premiums on which amount t o 3 2 4 , 4 7 5 5s. ad. ; 137 more havebeenaccepted,
but the policies have not been completed; the remaining 113 proposals the directors have deemed it prudent
to decline.
   The annual income has increased to 6 1 2 6 , 2 3 2 7 s . 6 d . , notwithstanding the reduction on premiums, amounting to
the sum of %10,716 3s. 6d., allowed to those members who choose this mode of appropriating the profits.
   The total amount of bonuses assigned in 1847, to policies on which the original prenliums continue to be paid,
is 837,834 4s., in addition to the sums assigned in 1842.
   The accounts to the 20th November last have been duly audited ; the balance of receipts over disbursements for
the gear is 6 7 2 , 8 5 5 19s. 3d., making the capital stock of the Institution a t that date &440,028 15s. Sd., which i s
invested in real and government securities.
   The sums paid for claims on policies of deceased members from the commencement of the Institution, including
the bonuses assigned thereto, amount to 8 1 1 1 , 3 3 9 10s. I d . , of which, 8 1 6 , 2 6 0 10s. has been paid within the last
twelve months, and the sum of 6 7 , 7 4 9 , not yet applied for, remains due on Lhis account.
   The foregoing summary, exhibiting such successful results in the short space of thirteen pears, attests both the
prosperity and usefulness of the Institution, and the peculiar advantages afforded by the entirely Mutual System of
Assurance on which it is founded.
   The following instances illustrate the Reduction i n Premiums and equivalent Bonuses on Policies in Class 9,
payable at death.

                                     OF



DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER.


                              CHAPTER I.
                               I AM BORN.
WHETHER I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether
    that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.
To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born
(as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at
night. I t was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began
to cry, simultaneously.
   I n consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by
the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken
a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of
our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be
unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and
spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all
unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a
Friday night.
   I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show
better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified
by the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only
remark, that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I
was still a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all
complain of having been kept out of this property; and if anybody
else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to
keep it.
   I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers,
at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going people were
short of money about that time, or were short of faith and preferred
cork-jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but one
solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-
broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance in
                                                               B
2              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain.
 Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss-for as to
 sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the market then-and
 ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our
 part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner
 to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to
 have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being
 disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady
 with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated
 five shillings, d l in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny short-as it took
 an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to endeavour without
 any effect to prove to her. I t is a fact which will be long remembered
as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died tri-
umphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was,
to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in
her lifc, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was
extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the
impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go
"meandering" about the world. It was in vain to represent to her
that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this ob-
jectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and
with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, "Let us
have no meandering."
    Not to meander, myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.
    I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or "thereby," as they say in
 Scotland. I was a postlumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon
the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is
something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw
me ; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have
of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the church-
yard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out done
there in the dark night, when our little parlor was warm and bright with
f i e and candle, and the doors of our house were-almost cruelly, i t seemed
to me sometimes-bolted and locked against it.
    An aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of
whom I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate
of our family. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always
called her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable
personage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married
to a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the
sense of the homely adage, "handsome is, that handsome doesH-for he
was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having
once, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined
arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. These
evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay
him off, and effect a separation by mutual consent. H e went to India
with his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he
was once seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but
I think it must have been a Baboo-or a Begum. Any how, from India
                          OP DAVID COPPERFIELD.                               u


  tidings of his death reached home, within ten years. How they affected
  my aunt, nobody knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took
 her maiden name again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a
 long way off, established herself there as a single woman with one servant,
 and was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible
 retirement.
     My father had once been a favorite of hers, I believe; but she was
 mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was
 " a wax doll."     She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be
 not yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. H e was
 double my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitu-
 tion. H e died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I
 came into the world.
     This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be
 excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no
 claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood ; or to have
 any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what
 follows.
     My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low
 in spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about
 herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by some
 grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer up-stairs, to a world not at all excited
on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting by the fire,
that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and very doubtful
of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her, when, lifting her
eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she saw a strange lady
coming up the garden.
    My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was Miss
Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the
garden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity
of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to
nobody else.
    When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity.
My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any
ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and
looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against
the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became
perfectly flat and white in a moment.
    She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I
am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been-born on a Friday.
    My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in
the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and enquiringly,
began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head in
a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown
and a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed,
to come and open the door. My mother went.
    " Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,"      said Miss Betsey ; the emphasis
referring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition.
    " Yes," said my mother, faintly.
                                       B 2
T             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPRRIENCE

    " Miss Trotwood," said the visitor. "You have heard of her, I dare
say ?"
   My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a dis-
agreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an
overpowering pleasure.
    " Now you see her," said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and
begged her to walk in.
    They went into the parlor my mother had come from, the fire in the
best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted-not having
been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral ; and when they were both
seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to
restrain herself, began to cry.
    " Oh tut, tut, tut !" said Miss Betsey, in a hurry.      " Don't do that!
Come, come !"
    My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had
had her cry out.
    " Take off your cap, child," said Miss Betsey, " and let me see you."

    My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this
odd request, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as
she was told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was
luxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.
    " Why, bless my heart !" exclaimed Miss Betsey.         " You are a very
Baby !"
    My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even
for her years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing,
and said, sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish
widow, and would be but a childish mother if she lived. I n a short
pause which ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her
hair, and that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid
hope, she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up,
her hands folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning     - at
the fire.
    <' I n the name of Heaven," said Miss Betsey, suddenly, " why Rookery ? "
    "DO you mean the house, ma'am? " asked my mother.
    "Why Rookery ? " said Miss Betsey. " Cookery would have been
more to the purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of Life, either of
y OU."
    <<Thename was Mr. Copperfield's choice," returned my mother.
 "When he bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks
about it."
    The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall
 old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor
 Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one
 another, like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds
 of such repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as
 if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,
 some weather-beaten ragged old rooksy-nests, burdening their higher
 branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.
     "Where are the birds? " asked Miss Betsey.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   "The -?"            My mother had been thinking of something else.
   "The rooks-what has become of them ?" asked Miss Betsey.
   "There have not been any since we have lived here," said my mother.
"We thought-Mr. Copperfield thought-it was quite a large rookery ;
but the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a
long while."
    <<DavidCopperfield all over ! " cried Miss Betsey. "David Copper-
field from head to foot ! Calls a house a rookery when there 's not a rook
near it, and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests ! "
    " Mr. Copperfield," returned my mother, " is dead, and if you dare to

speak unkindly of him to me-"
   My poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of
committing an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have
settled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better
training for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed
with the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very
meekly, and fainted.
   When she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,
whichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The
twilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as
they saw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the
fire.
    "Well ? " said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only
been taking a casual look at the prospect ; " and when do you expect-"
    " I am all in a tremble," falteredmy mother.      " I don't know what 's

the matter. I shall die, I am sure ! "
    "No, no, no," said Miss Betsey. " Have some tea."
    " Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good ? " cried
my mother in a helpless manner.
    " Of course i t will,"    said Miss Betsey . " I t 's nothing but fancy.
What do you call your girl ? "
    " I don't know that it will be a girl, yet, ma'am," said my mother

innocently.
    "Bless the Baby ! " exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the
second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer up-stairs, but applying
it to my mother instead of me, "I don't mean that. I mean your
servant-girl."
    "Peggotty," said my mother.
    " Peggotty !" repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation.      " Do you
mean to say, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church,
and got herself named Peggotty ? "
    " I t ' s her surname," said my mother, faintly.  "Mr. Copperfield called
her by it, because her Christian name was the same as mine."
    " Here ! Peggotty !" cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlor-door. " Tea.
Your mistress is a little unwell. Don't dawdle."
    Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had
been a recognised authority in the house ever since it had been a house,
and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the
passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut
6             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 the door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the
 skirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee.
     "You were speaking about its being a girl," said Miss Betsey. "I
 have no doubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a
 girl. Now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl-"
     "Perhaps boy," my mother took the liberty of putting in.
     " I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl," returned
 Miss Betsey. "Don't contradict. Prom the moment of this girl's birth,
 child, I intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg
 you'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes
in life with this Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with her
affections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded
from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I
must make that my care."
    There was a twitch of Miss Betsey's head, after each of these sentences,
as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any
plainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,
at least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire : too much
scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and be-
wildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what
to say.
    "And was David good to you, child ? " asked Miss Betsey, when she
had been silent for a little while, and these motions of her head had
gradually ceased. "Were you comfortable together? "
    "We were very happy," said my mother. " Mr. Copperfield was only
too good to me."
    " What, he spoilt you, I suppose ? " returned Miss Betsey.
    "For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world
again, yes, I fear he did indeed," sobbed my mother.
    " Well ! Don't cry! " saidMiss Betsey. " You were not equally matched,
child-if     any two people can be equally matched-and so I asked the
question. You were an orphan, weren't you?"
    r' Yes."
    " And a governess ?"
    " I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to

visit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of
notice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed
to me. And I accepted him. And so we were married," said my mother
simply.
    " Ha ! poor Baby !" mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon
the fire. " Do you know anything ?"
    " I beg your pardon, ma'am," faltered my mother.

    "About keeping house, for instance," said Miss Betsey.
    " Not much, I fear," returned my mother.     "Not so much as I could
wish. But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me-"
    (" Much he knew about it himself! ") said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.
   -" And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn,
and he very patient to teach, if the great misfortune of his death "-my
mother broke down again here, and could get no farther.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   '[Well, well !" said Miss Betsey.
   -<<     I kept my housekeeping-book regularly, and balanced it with Mr.
  Copperfield every night," cried my mother in another burst of distress,
  and breaking down again.
     " Well, well !" said Miss Betsey. " Don't cry any more."
     -a    And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it,
  except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too
  muchlike each other, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,"
  resumed my mother in another burst, and breaking down again.
     " You'll make yourself ill," said Miss Betsey, "and you know that will
  not be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come ! You mustn't
  do it ! "
     This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her
 increasing indisposition perhaps had a larger one. There was an interval
  of silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating " H a ! "
 as she sat with her feet upon the fender.
     " David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,"

  said she, by and by. " What did he do for you? "
     " Mr. Copperfield," said my mother, answering with some difficulty,
  "was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it
 to me."
     " How much? " asked Miss Betsey.
     "A hundred and five pounds a year," said my mother.
     " H e might have done worse," said my aunt.
    The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much
 worse that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing
 at a glance how ill she was,-as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if
 there had been light enough,-conveyed her up-stairs to her own room
 with all speed ; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew,
 who had been for some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my
 mother, as a special messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse
 and doctor.
    Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived
within a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of portentous
 appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied over her left arm,
 stopping her ears with jewellers' cotton. Peggotty knowing nothing
 about her, and my mother saying nothing about her, she was quite a
mystery in the parlor ; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers'
 cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article in her ears in that way, did
not detract from the solemnity of her presence.
    The doctor having been up-stairs and come down again, and having
 satisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this unknown
lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some hours, laid
himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of his sex, the
mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to take up the
less space. H e walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet, and more
slowly. H e carried his head on one side, partly in modest depreciation
of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody else. It is nothing
to say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He couldn't have
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

throw% a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one gently,
or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as he walked ;
but he wouldn't have been rude to him, and he couldn't have been
quick with him, for any earthly consideration.
   Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt, with his head on one side,
and making her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as
he softly touched his left ear :
   " Some local irritation, ma'am ? "

   "What! " replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like
a cork.
   Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness-as he told my mother
afterwards-that it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind.
But he repeated, sweetly :
   " Some local irritation, ma'am ? "

   " Nonsense !" replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one

blow.
   Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,
as she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called up-stairs again.
After some quarter of an hour's absence, he returned.
   "Well?" said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest
to him.
   " Well, ma'am," returned Mr. Chillip, "we are-we are progressing
slowly, ma'am."
   " Ba-a-ah       ! " said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous
interjection. And corked herself, as before.
   Really-really-as      Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked ;
speaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked.
But he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours, as
she sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After another
absence, he again returned.
   " Well ? " said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.

   " Well, ma'am," returned Mr. Chillip, " we are-we           are progressing
slowly, ma'am."
   " Ya-a-ah!"        said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip
absolutely could not bear it. I t was really calculated to break his spirit,
he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs, in the
dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.
   Ham Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very
dragon at his catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible
witness, reported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlor-door
an hour after this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking
to and fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make
his escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices
overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the circum-
stance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to
expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest. That,
marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had been
taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled his
hair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded them
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             9
with her own, and otherwise touzled and maltreated him. This was in
part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half-past twelve o'clock,
soon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was.
   The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if
at any time. He sidled into the parlor as soon as he was at liberty, and
said to my aunt in his meekest manner :
   "Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you."
   "What upon ? " said my aunt, sharply.
   Mr. Chillipwas fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's
manner ; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to mollify
her.
   " Mercy on the man, what's he doing ! " cried my aunt, impatiently.
" Can 't he speak? "
   "Be calm, my dear ma'am," said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.
" There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma'am.     Be calm."
   I t has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn 't shake
him, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own
head at him, but in a way that made him quail.
    "Well, ma'am," resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, " I
am happy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma'am, and well over."
   During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery
of this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.
   " How is she?" said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still

tied on one of them.
   " Well, ma'am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope," returned

Mr. Chillip. " Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to
be, under these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any
objection to your seeing her presently, ma'am. I t may do her good."
   " And she. How is she ?" said my aunt, sharply.
    Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my
aunt like an amiable bird.
   " The baby," said my aunt. " How is she ?"
   '< Ma'am," returned Mr. Chillip, " I apprehended you had known.
It's a boy."
   My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in
the manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip's head with it, put
it on bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a dis-
contented fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it
was popularly supposed I was entitled to see ; and never came back any
more.
    No. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey
Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows,
the tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light
upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all
such travellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once
was he, without whom I had never been.
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                             CHAPTER 11.
                                I OBSERVE.

    THEfirst objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look
 far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty
 hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so
 dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,
 and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't
 peck her in preference to apples.
    I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed
 to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going
 unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind
 which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of
 Peggotty's fore-finger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being
 roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.
    This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go
 farther back into such times than many of us suppose ; just as I believe
 the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite
 wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most
 grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater pro-
priety be said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it ; the
rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness, and
gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an inheritance
they have preserved from their childhood.
    I might have a misgiving that I am "meandering " in stopping to say
this, but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in
part upon my own experience of myself ; and if it should appear from any-
thing I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observa-
tion, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I
undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.
   Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first
objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of
things, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let
me see.
   There comes out of the cloud, our house-not new to me, but quite
familiar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's
kitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in the
centre, without any pigeons in it ; a great dog-kennel in a corner, without
any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me, walking
about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who
gets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as I
look at him through the kitchen-window, who makes me shiver, he is so
fierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me
with their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at night :
as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            11
      Here is a long passage-what an enormous perspective I make of it!-
   leading from Peggotty's kitchen to the front-door. A dark store-room
   opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at night ; for I don't
  know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea-chests, when
  there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light, letting a mouldy air
  come out at the door, in which there is the smell of soap, pickles, pepper,
   candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then there are the two parlors : the
  parlor in which we sit of an evening, my mother and I and Peggotty-
  for Peggotty is quite our companion, when her work is done and we are
  alone-and the best parlor where we sit on a Sunday ; grandly, but not
  so comfortably. There is something of a doleful air about that room to
  me, for Peggotty has told me-I don't know when, but apparently ages
  go-about myfather's funera1,and the company having their black cloaks put
  on. One Sunday night my mother reads to Peggotty and me in there,
  how Lazarus was raised up from the dead. And I am so frightened that
  they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed, and shew me the quiet
  churchyard out of the bedroom window, with the dead all lying in their
  graves at rest, below the solemn moon.
     There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of
  that churchyard ; nothing half so shady as its trees ; nothing half so quiet
  as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up, early
 in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my mother's room, to
 look out at it ; and I see the red light shining on the sun-dial, and think
 within myself, cc I s the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that it can tell the time
 again ? "
     Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a
 window near it, out of which our house can be seen, and is seen many
 times during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make her-
 self as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames.
 But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does,
 and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the
 clergyman. But I can't always look at him-I know him without that
 white thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and
perhaps stopping the service to enquire-and what am I to do? It's
a dreadful thing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my
mother, but she pretends not to see me.            I look at a boy in the
aisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at
the open door through the porch, and there I see a stray sheep-I don't
mean a sinner, but mutton-half making up his mind to come into the
 church. I feel that if I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted
to say something out loud; and what would become of me then ! I
look up at the monumental tablets on the wall, and try to think of
Mr. Bodgers late of this parish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must
have been, when affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physi-
cians were in vain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he
was in vain; and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week.
I look from Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit;
and think what a good place it would be to play in, and what a castle
it would make, with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and
1%             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head.
 I n time my eyes gradually shut u p ; and, from seeming to hear the
 clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I
 fall off the seat with a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive,- by-
 Peggotty.
    And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed bedroom-
windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the ragged
 old rooksy-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front
 garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the yard where the
 empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are-a very preserve of butterflies, as
 I rcmember it, with a high fence, and a gate and padlock ; where the
fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than fruit has ever been since,
in any other garden, and where my mother gathers some in a basket,
while I stand by, bolting furtive gooseberries, and trying to lookunmoved.
A great wind rises, and the summer is gone in a moment. We are
playing in the winter twilight, dancing about the parlor. When my
mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow-chair, I watch her
winding her bright curls round her fingers, and straitening her waist, and
nobody knows better than I do that she likes to look so well, and is proud
of being so pretty.
    That is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that
we were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most
things to her direction, were among the first opinions-if they may be so
called-that I ever derived from what I saw.
    Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlor fire, alone. I
had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read
very perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I
remember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were a sort
of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy ; but having leave, as a
high treat, to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening
at a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon my post (of course) than
have gone to bed. I had reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty
seemed to swell and grow immensely large. I propped my eyelids open
with my two forefingers, and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at
work; at the little bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread-how
old it looked, being so wrinkled in all directions !-at the little house with
a thatched roof, where the yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a
sliding lid, with a view of Saint Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted
on the top ; at the brass thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I
thought lovely. I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything,
for a moment, I was gone.
    "Peggotty," says I, suddenly, "were you ever married?"
    " Lord, Master Davy," replied Peggotty. "What 's put marriage in
your head !"
    She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she
stopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its
thread's length.
    " But were you ever married, Peggotty ? " says I. " You are a very
handsome woman, an't you ?"
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           13
   I thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly ; but of
another school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There was
a redvelvet footstool in the best parlor, on which my mother had painted
a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty's complexion,
appeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was smooth,
and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference.
   " Me handsome, Davy !" said Peggotty. " Lawk, no, my dear ! But
what put marriage in your head ? "
   " I don't know !-You mustn't marry more than one person at a time,
may you, Peggotty ?"
   " Certainly not," says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.
   "But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may
marry another person, mayn't you, Peggotty ? "
   "You MAY," says Peggotty, "if you choose, my dear. That's a
matter of oninion." -
   r c But wcat is your opinion, Peggotty ? " said I.
   I asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so curiously
at me.
    " My opinion is," said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little
indecision and going on with her work, "that I never was married myself,
Master Davy, and that I don't expect to be. That's all I know about the
subject."
   " You an't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you? " said I, after sitting
quiet for a minute.
   I really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was
quite mistaken : for she laid aside her work, (which was a stocking of her
own,) and opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and
gave it a good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being
very plump, whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed,
some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recol-
lect two
-       .
           bursting to the opposite side of the parlor, while she was
hugging me.
   " Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills," said Peggotty,

who was not quite right in the name yet, " for I an't heard half
enou~h."
---.  -~
       Q-
   I couldn't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or why she
was so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those
monsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in
the sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled
them by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on
account of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,
as natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in
short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did at least; but I had my
doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various
parts of her face and arms, all the time.
   We had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when
the garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my
mother, looking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman
with beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from
church last Sunday.
14            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    As my mother stooped down on the threshhold to take me in her arms
 and kiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little
 fellow than a monarch-or something like that ; for my later understanding
 comes, I am sensible, to my aid here.
    " What does that mean ? " I asked him, over her shoulder.
    H e patted me on the head ; but somehow, I didn't like him or his deep
 voice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in
 touching me-which it did. I put it away, as well as I could.
    " Oh Davy ! " remonstrated my mother.
    " Dear boy ! " said the gentleman. " I cannot wonder at his devotion!"
    I never saw such a beautiful color on my mother's face before. She
 gently chid me for being rude ; and, keeping me close to her shawl, turned
to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home.
She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with his own,
she glanced, I thought, at me.
    " Let us say ' good night,' my fine boy," said the gentleman, when he
had bent his head-1 saw him !-over my mother's little glove.
    " Good night !" said I.

    " Come ! Let us be the best friends in the world ! " said the gentleman,
laughing. " Shake hands ! "
   My right hand was in my mother's left, so I gave him the other.
    " Why that's the wrong hand, Davy ! " laughed the gentleman.
    My mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my
former reason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him the other, and
he shook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away.
    At this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last
look with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut.
   Peggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured the
fastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlor. My mother, con-
trary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the fire,
remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.
    "-Hope     you have had a pleasant evening, ma'am," said Peggotty,
standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick
in her hand.
    "Much obliged to you, Peggotty," returned my mother, in a cheerful
voice, " I have had a very pleasant evening."
   "A stranger or so makes an agreeable change," suggested Peggotty.
   " A very agreeable change indeed," returned my mother.

   Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room,
and my mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so
sound asleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.
When I half awoke from this uncomfortable dose, I found Peggotty and
my mother both in tears, and both talking.
   "Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked," said
Peggotty. "That I say, and that I swear !"
   " Good Heavens ! " cried my mother.       " You '11 drive me mad ! Was
ever any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am ! Why do I do
myself the injustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married,
Peggotty ?"

   " God knows you have, ma'am," returned Peggotty.
     " Then how can you dare," said my mother-" you know I don't mean
  how can you dare, Peggotty, but how can you have the heart-to make me
  so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me, when you are well
  aware that I haven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to ! "
     a The more 's the reason," returned Peggotty, " for saying that it
 won't do. No ! That it won't do. No ! No price could make it do.
 No ! "-I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away,
 she was so emphatic with it.
    "How can you be so aggravating," said my mother, shedding
 more tears than before, " as to talk in such an unjust manner ! How
 can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when I tell
 you over and over again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest
 civilities nothing has passed! You talk of admiration. What am I
 to do ? If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault ?
 What am I to do, I ask you? Would you wish me to shave my head
 and black my face, or disfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something
 of that sort ? I dare say you would, Peggotty. I dare say you 'd quite
 enjoy it."
    Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought.
    "And my dear boy," cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair in
 which I was, and caressing me, "my own little Davy ! I s it to be hinted
to me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest
little fellow that ever was ! "
    " Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing," said Peggotty.
    "You did, Peggotty !" returned my mother. " You know you did.
What else was it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature,
when you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I
wouldn't buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed
the whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy. You know it is,
Peggotty. You can't deny it." Then, turning affectionately to me, with
her cheek against mine, " Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy ? Am I a
nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama ? Say I am, my child ; say 'yes ;' dear boy,
and Peggotty will love you, and Peggotty's love is a great deal better
than mine, Davy. I dont love you at all, do I ? "
    At this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest of the
party, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was quite heart-
broken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded ten-
derness I called Peggotty a " Beast." That honest creature was in deep
aflhction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless on the
occasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off, when, after
having made it up with my mother, she kneeled down by the elbow-
chair, and made it up with me.
    We went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for a long
time; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed, I found
my mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me. I fell asleep in
her arms, after that, and slept soundly.
   Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again,
or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared, I
16            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

cannot recal. I don't profess to be clear about dates. But there he was,
in church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too, to
look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlor-window. I t did not
appear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked
my mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose
it for himself, but he refused to do that-I could not understand why-
so she plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would
never, never, part with it any more ; and I thought he must be quite a fool
not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.
    Peggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always
been. My mother deferred to her very much-more than usual, it occurred
to me-and we were all three excellent friends; still we were different
from what we used to be, and were not so comfortable among our-
selves. Sometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my
mother's wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her
going so often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, to my
satisfaction, make out how it was.
    Gradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black
whiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy
jealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child's instinctive
 dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make much of my
mother without any help, it certainly was not the reason that I might have
 found if I had been older. No such thing came into my mind, or near
 it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were ; but as to making a net of
 a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it, that was, as
 yet, beyond me.
    One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when
 Mr. Murdstone-I knew him by that name now-came by, on horseback.
 H e reined up his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to
 Lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht, and
 merrily proposed t o take me on the saddle before him if I would like the
 ride.
    The air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the idea
 of the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the
 garden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent up-stairs to
 Peggotty to be made spruce ; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone dis-
 mounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over his arm, walked slowly
 up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while my mother
 walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company. I recol-
 lect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I recol-
 lect how closely they appeared to be examining the sweetbriar between
 them, as they strolled along ; and how, from being in a perfectly angelic
  temper, Peggotty turned cross in a moment, and brushed my hair the
  wrong way, excessively hard.
     Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green
  turf by the side of the road. H e held me quite easily with one arm,
  and I don't think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my
  mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, and
  looking up in his face. H e had that kind of shallow black eye-I want
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

a better word to express an eye that has no depth i n it to be looked into-
which, when it is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be dis-
figured, for a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced
at him, I observed that appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what
he was thinking about so closely. His hair and whiskers were blacker
and thicker, looked at so near, than even I had given them credit for
being. A squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted
indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me
of the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-
year before. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black,
and brown, of his complexion- confound his complexion, and his
memory !-made        me think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very
handsome man. I have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought
him so too.
    We went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking
cigars in a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four
chairs, and had a large rough jacket on. I n a corner was a heap of coats
and boat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.
    They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when
we came in, and said " Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were
 dead ! "
    "Not yet," said Mr. Murdstone.
    " And who's this shaver? " said one of the gentlemen, taking hold
of me.
    " That's Davy," returned Mr. Murdstone.

    " Davy who ? " said the gentleman.     " Jones ? "

    " Copperfield," said Mr. Murdstone.

    " What ! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield's incumbrance ? " cried the
 gentleman. " The pretty little widow ? "
     " Quinion," said Mr. Murdstone, " take care, if you please. Somebody's
 sharp."
     " Who is ? " asked the gentleman, laughing.
    I looked up, quickly; being curious to know.
    " Only Brooks of Sheffield," said Mr. Murdstone.
    I was quite relieved to find it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for, as
 first, I really thought it was I.
    There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of
 Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he
 was mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After
 some laughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said :
     "And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the
 projected business ? "
     " Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at pre-

 sent," replied Mr. AEnrdstone; "but he is not generally favourable, I
 believe."
     There was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring
 the bell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did;
 and when the wine came, he made me have a little, with a biscuit, an$
 before I drank it, stand up and say "Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield !
                                      C
18             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 The toast was received with great applause, and such hearty laughter that
it made me laugh too; at which they laughed the more. I n short, we
quite enjoyed ourselves.
   We walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, and
looked at things through a telescope-I could make out nothing myself
when it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could-and then we came
back to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time we were out, the two
gentlemen smoked incessantly-which, I thought, if I might judge from the
smell of their roughcoats, they must have been doing, ever since the coatshad
first come home from the tailor's. I must not forget that we went on
board the yacht, where they all three descended into the cabin, and were busy
with some papers. I saw them quite hard at work, when I looked down
through the open skylight. They left me, during this time, with a very nice
man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it,
who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on, with " Skylark " in capital
letters across the chest. I thought it was his name; and that as he lived
on board ship and hadn't a street-door to put his name on, he put it
there instead; but when I called him Mr. Skylark, he said it meant the
vessel.
   I observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the
two gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked freely with
one another, but seldom with him. I t appeared to me that he was more
clever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with some-
thing of my own feeling. I remarked that once or twice when Mr.
Quinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to make
sure of his not being displeased ; and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the
other gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod upon his foot, and gave him
a secret caution with his eyes, to observe Mr. &!turdstone, who was sitting
stern and silent. Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed at all
that day, except at the Sheffield joke-and that, by the by, was his
own.
   MTe went home early in the evening. I t was a very fine evening, and
my mother and he had another stroll by the sweet-briar, while I was sent
in to get my tea, When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the
day I had had, and what they had said and done. I mentioned what they
had said about her, and she laughed, and told me they were impudent
fellows who talked nonsense-but I knew it pleased her. I knew it quite
as well as I know it now. I took the opportunity of asking if she was
at all acquainted with Nr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered
No, only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork
way.
   Can I say of her face-altered as I have reason to remember it,
perished as I know i t is-that it is gone, when here it comes before me at
this instant, as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a
crowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it
faded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it fell
that night ? Can I say she ever changed, when my remembrance brings
her back to life, thus only ; and, truer to its loving youth than I have been,
or man ever is, still holds fast what it cherished then?
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                              19
    I write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk,
 and she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully by the
 side of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing,
 said :
    'c What was it they said, Davy ?      Tell me again. I can't believe it."
    " ' Bewitching-'       " I began.
    My mother put her hands upon her lips to stop me.
    " It was never bewitching," she said, laughing. '< It never could have
been bewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn't !"
    "Yes it was. 'Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield,"' I repeated stoutly.
 " And 'pretty.' "
    " No no, it was never pretty.         Not pretty," interposed my mother,
 laying her fingers on my lips again.
    " Yes it was. ' Pretty little widow.' "
    " What foolish, impudent creatures !" cried my mother, laughing and
covering her face. "What ridiculous men ! An't they? Davy dear-"
    " Well, Ma."

    "Don't tell Peggotty ; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully
 angry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn't know."
    I promised, of course ; and we kissed one another over and over again,
 and I soon fell fast asleep.
   I t seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next day when
Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am about to
mention ; but it was probably about two months afterwards.
   We were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out
as before), in company with the stocking and the yard measure, and the
bit of wax, and the box with Saint Paul's on the lid, and the crocodile
book, when Peggotty, after looking at me several times, and opening
her mouth as if she were going to speak, without doing it-which I
thought was merely gaping, or I should have been rather alarmed-said
coaxingly :
    "Master Davy, how should you like to go along with me and spend a
fortnight at my brothcr's at Yarmouth? Wouldn't tAat be a treat? "
   " I s your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty? " I enquired, pro-
visionally.
    " Oh what an agreeable man he is ! " cried Peggotty, holding up her
hands. "Then there's the sea; and the boats and ships; and the
fishermen ; and the beach ; and Am to play with-"
    Peggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned in my first chapter ;ut
she spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar.
    I was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it woula
indeed be a treat, but what would my mother say?
    "Why then I'll as good as bet a guinea," said Peggotty, intent uponmy
face, " that she '11 let us go. I 1' 1 ask her, if you like, as soon as ever she
comes home. There now ! "
   " But what 's she to do while we 're away ? " said I, putting my small

elbows on the table to argue the point. " She can 't live by herself."
   If Peggotty were looking for a hole, all of a sudden, in the heel of that
stocking, i t must have been a very little one indeed, and not worth
darning.                                   c 2
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  "    I say ! Peggotty ! She can 't live by herself, you know."
  "    Oh bless you! " said Peggotty, looking at me again at last. "Don't
you know? She's going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper.
Mrs. Grayper's going to have a lot of company."
    Oh ! If that was it, I was quite ready to go. I waited, in the utmost
impatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper's (for it was
that identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out
this great idea. Without being nearly so much surprised as I had expected,
my mother entered into it readily; and it was all arranged that night, and
my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for.
    The day soon came for our going. I t was such an early day that it
came soon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and half afraid
that an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsioil of
nature, might interpose to stop the expedition. We were to go in a
carrier's cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast. I would
have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night,
and sleep in my hat and boots.
    I t touches me nearly now, although I tell it lightly, to recollect how
eager I was to leave my happy home ; to think how little I suspected what
I did leave for ever.
    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier's cart was at the gate, and
my mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for the
old place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry. I am
 glad to know that my mother cried too, and that I felt her heart beat
against mine.
    I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my mother
ran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that she might kiss me
once more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which
 she lifted up her face to mine, and did so.
    As we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to where
 she was, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved. I was
looking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business it
 was of his. Peggotty, who was also looking back on the other side,
 seemed anything but satisfied ; as the face she brought back into the cart
 denoted.
     I sat looking at Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this supposi-
 titious case : whether, if she were employed to lose me like the boy in
 the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons
 she would shed.

                            CHAPTER 111.
                           I HATE A CHANGE.
    THEcarrier's horse was the laziest horse in the world, I should hope,
and shuffled along, with his head down, as if he liked to keep the people
waiting to whom the packages were directed. I fancied, indeed, that he
 sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection, but the carrier said he
was only troubled with a cough.
    The carrier had a way of keeping his head down, like his horse, and of
drooping sleepily forward as he drove, with one of his arms on each of his
knees. I say "drove," but it struck me that the cart would have gone
to Yarmouth quite as well without him, for the horse did all that ; and as
to conversation, he had no idea of it but whistling.
    Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee, which would
have lasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by the
same conveyance. We ate a good deal, and slept a good deal. Peggotty
always went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket, her
hold of which never relaxed; and I could not have believed unless I had
heard her do it, that one defenceless woman could have snored so
much.
   We made so many deviations up and down lanes, and were such a
long time delivering a bedstead at a public-house, and calling at other
places, that I was quite tired, and very glad, when we saw Yarmouth.
I t looked rather spongey and soppy, I thought, as I carried my eye
over the great dull waste that lay across the river; and I could not
help wondering, if the world were really as round as my geography-
book said, how any part of it came to be so flat. But I reflected that
Yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles; which would account
for it.
    As we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying
a straight low line under the sky, I hinted to Peggotty that a mound
 or so might have improved i t ; and also that if the land had been a little
 more separated from the sea, and the town and the tide had not been
 quite so much mixed up, like toast and water, it would have been nicer.
 But Peggotty said, with greater emphasis than usual, that we must take
 things as we found them, and that, for her part, she was proud to call
 herself a Yarmouth Bloater.
    When we got into the street (which was strange enough to me), and
 smelt the fish, and pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors
 walking about, and the carts jingling up and down over the stones, I felt
 that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to Peg-
 gotty, who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency, and
 told me it was well known (I suppose to those who had the good fortune

                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            23
there were some common colored pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture
subjects ; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without
seeing the whole interior of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view.
Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow cast
into a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these. Over the
little mantel-shelf, was a picture of the Sarah Jane lugger, built a t
Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to i t ; a work of art,
combining composition with carpentery, which I considered to be one of
the most enviable possessions that the world could afford. There were
some hooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use of which I did not divine
then; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort, which
served for seats and eked out the chairs.
    All this, I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold-child-
like, according to my theory-and then Peggotty opened a little door and
showed me my bedroom. I t was the completest and most desirable
bedroom ever seen-in the stern of the vessel ; with a little window, where
the rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass, just the right
height for me, nailed against the wall, and framed with oyster-shells ; a
little bed, which there was just room enough to get into; and a nosegay
of seaweed in a blue mug on the table. The walls were whitewashed as
white as milk, and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache
with its brightness. One thing I particularly noticed in this delightful
house, was the smell of fish ; which was so searching, that when I took
out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose, I found it smelt exactly as
if i t had wrapped up a lobster. On my imparting this discovery
in confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother dealt in
lobsters, crabs, and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these
creatures, in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another,
and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of, were usually
to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were
kept.
   We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom
I had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back,
about a quarter of a mile off. Likewise by a most beautiful little
girl (or I thought her so) with a necklace of blue beads on, who
wouldn't let me kiss her when I offered to, but ran away and hid herself.
By and by, when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs,
melted butter, and potatoes, with a chop for me, a hairy man with
a very good-natured face came home. As he called Peggotty "Lass,"
and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I had no doubt, from the
general propriety of her conduct, that he was her brother; and so he
turned out-being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty, the
master of the house.
    " Glad to see you, sir," said Mr. Peggotty. "You'll find us rough,
sir, but you '11 find us ready."
    I thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such
a delightful place.
    " How's    your Ma, sir," said Mr. Peggotty. "Did you leave her
pretty jolly ? "
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AXD EXPERIENCE

    I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could
wish, and that she desired her compliments-which was a polite fiction
on my part.
    " I 'm much obleeged to her, I 'm sure,"     said Mr. Peggotty. c r Well
sir, if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her," nodding at
his sister, " and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of your
company."
    Having done the honors of his house in this hospitable manner,
Mr. Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water, remarking
that 'I cold would never get his muck off."        He soon returned, greatly
improved in appearance ; but so rubicund, that I couldn't help thinking
his face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs, and crawfish,-that
it went into the hot water very black, and came out very red.
   After tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the nights
being cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat
that the imagination of man could conceive. To hear the wind getting
up out at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat
outside, and to look at the fire, and think that there was no house near
but this one, and this one a boat, was like enchantment. Little Em'ly
had overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my side upon the lowest
and least of the lockers, which was just large enough for us two, and just
fitted into the chimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was
knitting on the opposite side of the fire. Peggotty at her needle-work
was as much at home with Saint Paul's and the bit of wax-candle, as if
they had never known any other roof. Ham, who had been giving me
my first lesson in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme of telling
fortunes with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of his
thumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe.
I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence.
    " Mr. Peggotty ! " says I.
    "Sir," says he.
    " Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort
of ark ? "
   Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered :
    " No, sir. I never giv him no name."
    "Who gave him that name, then? " said I, putting question number
two of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty.
    "Why, sir, his father giv it him," said Mr. Peggotty.
    " I thought you were his father ! "
    " My brother Joe was his father," said Mr. Peggotty.

    " Dead, Mr. Peggotty ? "     I hinted, after a respectful pause.
    " Drowndead," said Mr. Peggotty.
    I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father,
and began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to
anybody else there. I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind
to have it out with Mr. Peggotty.
    " Little Em'ly," I said, glancing at her. "She is your daughter, isn 't
she, Mr. Peggotty ? "
    " No, sir.   My brother in law, Tom, was her father."

    I couldn 't help it. " -Dead, Mr. Peggotty ? " I hinted, after another
respectful silence.
    " Drowndead," said Mr. Peggotty.
    I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the
bottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow. So I said :
    " Havn 't you any children, Mr. Peggotty ? "

    " No, master," he answered with a short laugh. " I 'm a bacheldore."
    " A bachelor ! "    I said, astonished. " Why, who 's that, Mr. Peg-
gotty ? " Pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting.
    " That's Missis Gummidge," said Mr. Peggotty.
    " Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty ?"
    But at this point Peggotty-I mean my own peculiar Peggotty-
made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions,
that I could only sit and look at all the silent company, until it
was time to go to bed. Then, in the privacy of my own little cabin,
she informed me that Ham and Em'ly were an orphan nephew and
niece, whom my host had at different times adopted in their child-
hood, when they were left destitute ; and that Mrs. Gummidge was
the widow of his partner in a boat, who had died very poor. EIe
was but a poor man himself, said Peggotty, but as good as gold
and as true as steel-those were her similies. The only subject, she
informed me, on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore an
oath, was this generosity of his; and if it were ever referred to, by any
one of them, he struck the table a heavy blow with his right hand (had
split it on one such occasion), and swore a dreadful oath that he would
be ' Gormed' if he didn't cut and run for good, if it was ever men-
tioned again. It appeared, in answer to my inquiries, that nobody
had the least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb passive to be
gormed; but that they all regarded it as constituting a most solemn
imprecation.
    I was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened to the
 women's going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end
 of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves
 on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, in a very luxurious state of
 mind, enhanced by my being sleepy. As slumber gradually stole upon
 me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the flat so
 fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the
 night. But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after all; and that a
 man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything
 did happen.
    Nothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as it
 shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out
 with little Em'ly, picking up stones upon the beach.
    " You're quite a sailor, I suppose ? " I said to Em'ly. I don't know
 that I supposed any thing of the kind, but I felt it an act of gallantry to
 say something; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little
 image of itself, at the moment, in her bright eye, that it came into my head
 to say this.
     " No," replied Em'ly, shaking her head, " I'm afraid of the sea."
26            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    "Afraid !" I said, with a becoming air of boldness, and looking very
 big at the mighty ocean. "Ia'nt ! "
    "Ah ! but it's cruel," said Em'ly. " I have seen it very cruel to some
 of our men. I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, all to pieces."
    "I hope i t was'nt the boat that -"
    " That father was drownded in ?" said Em'ly. " No. Not that one, I
never see that boat."
    " Nor him ?" I asked her.
    Little Em'ly shook her head. " Not to remember ! "
    Here was a coincidence ! I immediately went into an explanation how
 I had never seen my own father; and how my mother and I had always
lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and lived so then, and
always meant to live so ; and how my father's grave was in the churchyard
near our house, and shaded by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I
had walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning. But
there were some differences between Em'ly's orphanhood and mine, it ap-
peared. She had lost her mother before her father; and where her father's
grave was no one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of the
sea.
    "Besides," said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles,
" your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father
was a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman's daughter, and my uncle
Dan is a fisherman.
    " Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he ? " said I.
    " Uncle Dan-yonder," answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house.
    "Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think? "
    " Good? " said Em'ly.    " If I was ever to be a lady, I 'd give him a
sky-blue coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet
waistcoat, a cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of
money ."
   I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures.
I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease
in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece, and that I
was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat ; but I kept these
sentiments to myself.
   Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration
of these articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again,
picking up shells and pebbles.
    " You would like to be a lady ? " I said.
   Emily looked at me, and laughed and nodded "yes."
   " I should like it very much.     We would all be gentlefolks together,
then. Me, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't
mind then, when there come stormy weather.-Not for our own sakes, I
mean. We would for the poor fishermen's, to be sure, and we 'd help 'em
with money when they come to any hurt."
   This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all
improbable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it,
and little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly,
    " Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now ? "
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            27
    It was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I had seen
 a moderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my
 heels, with an awful recollection of her drowned relations. However, I
 said " No," and I added, "You don't seem to be, either, though you say
you are;"-for     she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of
 old jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon, and I was afraid of
her falling over.
    "I'm not afraid in this way," said little Em'ly. "But I wake
when it blows, and tremble to think of uncle Dan and Ham, and
believe I hear'em crying out for help. That's why I should like so
much to be a lady. But I ' m not afraid in this way. Not a bit. Look
here ! "
    She started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which pro-
truded from the place we stood upon, and overhung the deep water at
some height, without the least defence. The incident is so impressed on
my remembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form
here, I daresay, accurately as it was that day, and little Em'ly springing
forward to her destruction (as it appeared to me), with a look that I have
never forgotten, directed far out to sea.
   The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me,
and I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had uttered ; fruitlessly
in any case, for there was no one near. But there have been times since,
in my manhood, many times there have been, when I have thought, I s it
possible, among the possibilities of hidden things, that in the sudden
rashness of the child and her wild look so far off, there was any merciful
attraction of her into danger, any tempting her towards him permitted
on the part of her dead father, that her life might have a chance of
ending that day. There has been a time since when I have wondered
whether, if the life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance,
and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it, and if her pre-
servation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I ought to have
held it up to save her. There has been a time since-I            do not say
it lasted long, but it has been-when I have asked myself the question,
would it have been better for little Em'ly to have had the waters close
above her head that morning in my sight; and when I have answered
Yes, it would have been.
   This may be premature. I have set it down too soon, perhaps. But
let it stand.
   We strolled a long way, and loaded ourselves with things that we
thought curious, and put some stranded star-fish carefully back into
the water-I hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be
quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing
so, or the reverse-and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty's
dwelling. We stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to
exchange
   . .     an innocent kiss, and went in to breakfast glowing with health
and pleasure.
     Like two young mavishes," Mr. Peggotty said. I knew this meant,
in our local dialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as a com-
pliment.
28            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   Of course I was in love with little Em'ly. I am sure Iloved that baby
quite as truly, quite as tenderly, with greater purity, and more disinterest-
edness, than can enter into the best love of a later time of life, high and
ennobling as it is. I am sure my fancy raised up something round that
blue-eyed mite of a child, which etherealised, and made a very angel of
her. If, any sunny forenoon, she had spread a little pair of wings and
flown away before my eyes, I don't think I should have regarded it as
much more than I had had reason to expect.
   We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving
manner, hours and hours. The days sported by us, as if Time had not
grown up himself yet, but were a child too, and always at play. I told
Em'ly I adored her, and that unless she confessed she adored me I should
be reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword. She said she
did, and I have no doubt she did.
   As to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty in our
way, little Em'ly and I had no such trouble, because we had no future.
We made no more provision for growing older, than we did for growing
younger. We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty, who
used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little locker
side by side, " Lor ! wasn 't it beautiful ! " Mr. Peggotty smiled at us
from behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing
else. They had something of the sort of pleasure in us, I suppose,
that they might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the
Colosseum.
   I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself
so agreeable as she might have been expected to do, under the cir-
cumstances of her residence with Mr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge's was
rather a fretful disposition, and she whimpered more sometimes than
was comfortable for other parties in so small an establishment. I was
very sorry for her ; but there were moments when it would have been
more agreeable, I thought, if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient
apartment of her own to retire to, and had stopped there until her spirits
revived.
   Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public house called The Willing
Mind. I discovered this, by his being out on the second or third evening
of our visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge's looking up at the dutch clock,
between eight and nine, and saying he was there, and that, what was
more, she had known in the morning he would go there.
   Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day, and had burst into
tears in the forenoon, when the fire smoked. "I am a lone lorn creetur',"
were Mrs. Gummidge's words, when that unpleasant occurrence took
place, "and everythink goes contrairy with me."
   " Oh, it 1' 1 soon leave off," said Peggotty-I again mean our Peggotty
-" and besides, you know, it's not more disagreeable to you than to us."
   " I feel it more," said Mrs. Gnmmidge.
   I t was a very cold day, with cutting blasts of wind. Mrs. Gummidge's
peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and
snuggest in the place, as her chair was certainly the easiest, but it didn't
 suit her that day at all. She was constantly complaining of the cold, and
                         OP DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            29
of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called "the creeps."
A t last she shed tears on that subject, and said again that she was " a lone
lorn creetur' and everythink went contrairy with her."
     " It is certainly very cold," said Peggotty. "Everybody must feel it so."
    rc I feel it more than other people," said Mrs. Gummidge.
     So at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately
after me, to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction.
The fish were small and bony, and the potatoes were a little burnt. We
all acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment; but
Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than we did, and shed tears again,
and made that former declaration with great bitterness.
    Accordingly, when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o'clock, this
unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner in a very wretched
and miserable condition. Peggotty had been working cheerfully. Ham
had been patching up a great pair of water-boots; and I, with little
Em'ly by my side, had been reading to them. Mrs. Gummidge had never
made any other remark than a forlorn sigh, and had never raised her eyes
since tea.
     " Well, Mates," said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, " and how are you ?"

    We all said something, or looked something, to welcome him, except
 Mrs. Gummidge, who only shook her head over her knitting.
     "What's amiss," said Mr. Peggotty, with a clap of his hands.
" Cheer up, old Mawther ! " (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.)
    Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up. She took out
an old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes ; but instead of putting
i t in her pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, and still kept it out,
ready for-use.
    " What's amiss, dame !" said Mr. Peggotty.
    " Nothing," returned Mrs. Gummidge. "You've come from The
Wrilling Mind, Dan'l P"
     " Why yes, I've took a short spell at The Willing Mind to-night," said
Mr. Peggotty.
     " I'm sorry I should drive you there," said Mrs. Gummidge.

     " Drive! I don't want no driving," returned Mr. Peggotty with an

honest laugh. " I only go too ready."
     " Very ready," said nlrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her
eyes. " Yes, yes, very ready. I am sorry it should be along of me that
you 're so ready ."
     " Along o' you? I t an't along o' you ! " said Mr. Peggotty. "Don't
ye believe a bit on it."
     " Yes, yes, it is," cried Mrs. Gummidge. " I know what I am. I
 know that I ' m a lone lorn creetur, and not only that everythink
 goes contrairy with me, but that I go contrairy with everybody. Yes,
yes. I feel more than other people do, and I show it more. It's my
 misfortun'."
     I really couldn't help thinking, as I sat taking in all this, that the
 misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides
 Mrs. Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort, only answering
 with another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up.
30            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " I an't what I could wish myself to be," said Mrs. Gummidge. " I
am far from it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me contrairy.
I feel my troubles, and they make me contrairy. I wish I did'nt feel 'em,
but I do. I wish I could be hardened to 'em, but I an't. I make the
house uncomfortable. I don't wonder at it. I've made your sister so
 all day, and Master Davy."
    Here I was suddenly melted, and roared out "No, you have'nt, Mrs
Gummidge," in great mental distress.
    " It's far from right that I should do it," said Mrs. Gummidge. " I t
an't a fit return. I had better go into the house and die. I am a lone
lorn creetur, and had much better not make myself contrairy here. If
thinks must go contrairy with me, and I must go contrairy myself, let me
go contrairy in my parish. Dan'l, I'd better go into the house, and.
die and be a riddance !"
    Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to bed.
When she was gone, Mr. Peggotty, who had not exhibited a trace of any
feeling but the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, and nodding
his head with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face,
said in a whisper :
    " She's been thinking of the old'un !"
    I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was
supposed to have fixed her mind upon, until Peggotty, on seeing me
to bed, explained that it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that
her brother always took that for a received truth on such occasions,
and that it always had a moving effect upon him. Some time after he
was in his hammock that night, I heard him myself repeat to Ham,
"Poor thing! She's been thinking of the old 'un!" And whenever
Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder
of our stay (which happened some few times), he always said the same
thing in extenuation of the circumstance, and always with the tenderest
commiseration.
    So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of
the tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and coming in,
and altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was unemployed,
he sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships, and once or
twice he took us for a row. I don't know why one slight set of impres-
sions should be more particularly associated with a place than another,
though I believe this obtains with most people, in reference especially to
the associations of their childhood. I never hear the name, or read the
name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on
the beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly leaning on my shoulder,
Ham lazily dropping stones into the water, and the sun, away at sea,
just breaking through the heavy mist, and showing us the ships, like
their own shadows.
    At last the day came for going home. I bore up against the separation
from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving
little Em'ly was piercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house
where the carrier put up, and I promised, on the road, to write to her.
(I redeemed that promise afterwards, in characters larger than those in
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            31
which apartments are usually announced in manuscript, as being to let).
We were greatly overcome at parting ; and if ever, in my life, I have had a
void made in my heart, I had one made that day.
   Now, all the time I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful to my
home again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But I was no
sooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience seemed
to point that way with a steady finger; and I felt, all the more for the
sinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and that my mother was my
comforter and friend.
   This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew,
and the more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more
excited I was to get there, and to run into her arms. But Peggotty,
instead of sharing in these transports, tried to check them (though very
kindly), and looked confused and out of sorts.
   Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, in spite of her, when the
carrier's horse pleased-and did. How well I recollect it, on a cold grey
afternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain !
   The door opened, and I looked, half laughing and half crying in my
pleasant agitation, for my mother. I t was not she, but a strange
servant.
   " Why, Peggotty !" I said, ruefully, "isn't she come home !"

   " Yes, yes, Master Davy," said Peggotty. " She's come home. Wait
a bit, Master Davy, and 1'11-1 1  ' 1 tell you something."
   Between her agitation, and her natural awkwardness in getting out of
the cart, Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself, but I
felt too blank and strange to tell her so. When she had got down, she
took me by the hand ; led me, wondering, into the kitchen; and shut the
door.
   " Peggotty ! " said I, quite frightened.     "What 's the matter? "
   "Nothing's the matter, bless you, Master D a ~ ydear! " she answered,
assuming an air of sprightliness.
   " Something 's the matter, I 'm sure. Where's mama? "
   " Where 's mama, Master Davy ? " repeated Peggotty.
   " Yes. Why hasn 't she come out to the gate, and what have we come
in here for? Oh, Peggotty ! " My eyes were full, and I felt as if I were
going to tumble down.
   "Bless the precious boy ! " cried Peggotty, taking hold of me. " What
is it ? Speak, my pet ! "
   " Not dead, too ! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty ? "
   Peggotty cried out No ! with an astonishing volume of voice; and then
sat down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn.
   I gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another turn in
the right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in anxious
inquiry.
   "You see, dear, I should have told you before now," said Peggotty,
"but I hadn't an opportunity. I ought to have made it, perhaps, but I
couldn't azackly "-that was always the substitute for exactly, in Peggotty's
militia of words-" bring my mind to it."
   " Go on, Peggotty," said I, more frightened than before.
32            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   "Master Davy," said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking
hand, and speaking in a breathless sort of way. " What do you think?
You have got a P a ! "
   I trembled, and turned white. Something-I don't know what, or
how-connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising of the
dead, seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind.
   " A new one," said Peggotty.
   " A new one ?" I repeated.
   Peggotty gave a gasp, as if she were swallowing something that was
very hard, and, putting out her hand, said :
   " Come and see him."

   " I don't want to see him."
   - "And your mamma," said Peggotty.
   I ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlor, where
she left me. On one side of the fire, sat my mother; on the other,
Mr. Murdstone. My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, but
timidly I thought.
   " Now, Clara my dear," said Mr. Murdstone.         " Recollect ! controul

yourself, always controul yourself! Davy boy, how do you do ? "
   I gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed
my mother : she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down
again to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him, I
knew quite well that he was looking at us both; and I turned to the
window and looked out there, at some shrubs that were drooping their
heads in the cold.
   As soon as I could creep away, I crept up-stairs. My old dear bedroom
was changed, and I was to lie a long way off. I rambled down-stairs to
find anything that was like itself, so altered it all seemed; and roamed
into the yard. I very soon started back from there, for the empty dog-
kennel was filled up with a great dog-deep mouthed and black-haired
like Him-and he was very angry at the sight of me, and sprung out to
get at me.

cates for better laws and a better tribunal to protect copyright in designs, and for a
largely increased extension of copyright. We think the restless demands of the public
for constant novelty are alike mischievous to the progress of good ornamental art as
they are to all comnlercial interests. W e think that the Schools of Design should be
reformed and made husiness-like realities. W e shall wage war against all pirates; and
we hope to see the day when it will be thought as disgraceful for one manufacturer to
pillage another's patterns as it is held to be if he should walk into the counting-house
and rob his till. These are some of the points of our political creed, with which we start
on our undertaking. I n conclusion, we profess that our aim is to foster ornamental art in
all its ways, and to do those things for its advance, in all its branches, which it would be
the appropriate business of a Board of Design to do, if such a useful department of
Government actually existed.

I   ANALYSIS O F THE NAME O F M O S E S & SON.

!      ITis not a little interesting to notice the many recommendatory nouns and adjectives which bear as their
    initial characters the letters composing the name of MOSES& SON. For instance : the letter '&M*at
    once reminds of (M)atchless (M)ake and (M)agnificent (M)aterial.-The               letter " 0 " is displayed in
    (0)ut-and-(0)ut (O)vercaats, (0)btainable (0)pposite the Church.-The               letter " S " is the initial
    character of the words (S)trength, S)martness, (S)tyle, and (S)uitability.-The           letter L 6 E "will be
    found in (E)ronomy, (E)uellence, [P)gnity, (E)xchange, and (S)o on.
       The A " in the conjunction whispers of (A)dmirable (A)rticies (A)dapted to ( ~ ) 1 1 . - ~ ~ ~ in     , " the
    same word, will show itself in (=)one so (N)oted as this (N)otorious (=)sine in trade.-The        letter "D lS
    calls to mind (D)urable (D)ress, (D)elicate ( ~ ) e s i g n ,and (D)ispatch.
       The word SON, it is true, furnishes us with the very same letters as we have just pointed out; but,
    notwithstanding, there will be no difficulty in finding new footsteps to tread in.
       A (S)lap-up (S)uit, for instance, at once gives us the letter "S " over again ;as do also the words
    (S)howrooms, (S)hawls, (S)carfs, (S)ilks, (S)atins, (S)hifts, and (S)o forth.-The             character "0,"
    again, speaks of (O)utfits, (O)xonians, and (0)ther similar article~.-~'W," in eouclusion, appears in
     (Nleatness, (N)icety, and (N)eglect in (W)othing, at the celebrated House of that Firm whose name
    has been thus truthfully analysed.

       CAVTION.-E MOSES & SON regret having to guard the public against imposition, but having heard
    that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or it is the same concern, has been
    resorted to in many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion withany
    other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 36, Fargate, Sheffield, and 19,
    Thornton's Buildings, Bradford, Yorkshire ; and those who desire genuine and cheap Clothing, &c., should
    call at or send to Minories and Aldgate, City, London ; or to the Branch Establishments as above.
       TAKENOTICE.--This Establishment is closed from sunset Friday, till sunset Saturday, when business is
    resumed till 12 o'clock.
       BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NIUOLL), there is
     another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
     name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
     wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
     be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUlNEAS.




        .--
          The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                              Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
        T H E REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Spring Months, with all
     the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two
     GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,
     but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the
     intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,
     within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,
     with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be seen, ready for
     immediate wear, in every size, at the Patentees' Warerooms.

 T  HE peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
    FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest materials, quite equal to the best made in Paris.     Also,

  GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
   These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
         T H E EIDER D O W N QUILT,
also, is to be seen only at their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
 Qarriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                       BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, WITH PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable-
   OLD FEATHER-BEDS re-dressed by this process are perfectly freed from all
impurities ; and, by expanding the Feathers, the bulk is greatly increased, and the
Bed consequently rendered much fuller and softer, at 3d. per lb.
  OLD AND MOTHY MATTRESSES effectually cured and re-made.

intellect which evinced so intimate a knowledge of life     assails them, his extraordinary aptitudeinthe delineation
and such inimitable powers of portraiture in ' Vanity       of character, and his happy facility in seizing its salient
 Fair.' Mr. Thackeray's sympathies are all healthy and      points, the quiet unpremeditatedness with which his
mvigorating-there is an indomitable spirit of English       thoughts flow from his pen, and the tone of wholesome
frankness and manliness about him-he is the sworn           morality which pervades his writings, all combine to
enemy of all humbng and pretension, and the good            render   him deservedly popular."       3forning Herald.

                             CHAPTER IV.
                         I FALL INTO DISGRACE.

      IFthe room to which my bed was removed, were a sentient thing that
 could give evidence, I might appeal to it at this day-who sleeps there
 now, I wonder !-to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to
 it. I went up there, hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the
 way while I climbed the stairs ; and, looking as blank and strange upon the
 room as the room looked upon me, sat down with my small hands crossed,
 and thought.
     I thought of the oddest things. Of the shape of the room, of the cracks
 in the ceiling, of the paper on the wall, of the flaws in the window-glass
 making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of the washing-stand being
 ricketty on its three legs, and having a discontented something about it,
 which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge under the influence of the old one.
 I was crying all the time, but, except that I was conscious of being cold
 and dejected, I am sure I never thought why I cried. At last in my
 desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little
 Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to come here where no one
 seemed to want me, or to care about me, half as much as she did. This
 made such a very miserable piece of business of it, that I rolled myself up
in a corner of the counterpane, and cried myself to sleep.
     I was awoke by somebody saying " Here he is ! " and uncovering my
hot head. My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was
one of them who had done it.
     uDavy,'y said my mother. "What 's the matter? "
     I thought it very strange that she should ask me, and answered,
 " Nothing." I turned over on my face, I recollect, to hide my trembling
lip, which answered her with greater truth.
     "Davy," said my mother. "Davy, my child !"
     I dare say no words she could have uttered, would have affected me so
much, then, as her calling me her child. I hid my tears in the bedclothes,
and pressed her from me with my hand, when she would have raised
me up.
     "This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!" said my mother.
"1 have no doubt at all about it. How can you reconcile it to your
conscience, I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against
anybody who is dear to me? What do you mean by it, Peggotty ? "
    Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes, and only answered, in a
sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, "Lord
forgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and for what you have said this minute,
may you never be truly sorry !"
    '< It 's enough to distract me," cried my mother. " In my honeymoon,
too, when my most inveterate enemy might relent, one would think, and
not envy me a little peace of mind and happiness. Davy, you naughty
boy ! Peggotty, you savage creature ! Oh, dear me !" cried my mother,
                                                              D
34            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

turning from one of us to the other, in her pettish wilful manner, "what
a troublesome world this is, when one has the most right to expect it to
be as agreeable as possible ! "
   I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither her's nor Peggotty's,
and slipped to my feet at the bed-side. I t was Mr. Murdstone's hand,
and he kept it on my arm as he said:
   "What's this ? Clara, my love, have you forgotten? -Firmness,
my dear !"
   "I am very sorry, Edward," said my mother. " I meant to be very
good, but I am so uncomfortable."
   " Indeed ! " he answered.     "That's a bad hearing, so soon, Clara."
   " I say it 's very hard I should be made so now," returned my mother,
pouting; " and it is-very hard-isn't i t ? "
   He drew her to him, whispered in her ear, and kissed her. I knew as
well, when I saw my mother's head lean down upon his shoulder, and her
arm touch his neck-I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature
into any form he chose, as I know, now, that he did it.
   " Go you below, my love," said Mr. Murdstone. "David and I will
come down, together. My friend," turning a darkening face on Peggotty,
when he had watched my mother out, and dismissed her with a nod and a
smile : " do you know your mistress's name ? "
   " She has been my mistress a long time, sir," answered Peggotty.        "I
ought to it."
   "That's true," he answered. "But I thought I heard you, as I came
up-stairs, address her by a name that is not hers. She has taken mine, you
know. Will you remember that ? "
   Peggotty, with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out of the
room without replying ; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected to go,
and had no excuse for remaining. When we two were left alone, he shut the
door, and sitting on a chair, and holding me standing before him, looked
steadily into my eyes. I felt my own attracted, no less steadily, to his.
As I recall our being opposed thus, face to face, I seem again to hear my
heart beat fast and high.
   "David," he said, making his lips thin, by pressing them together,
"if I have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with, what do you think
I do?"
   " I don't know."

   " I beat him."
   I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper, but I felt, in my silence,
that my breath was shorter now.
   " I make him wince, and smart.      I say to myself, ' I '11 conquer that
fellow; ' and if it were to cost him all the blood he had, I should do it.
What is that upon your face ? "
   "Dirt," I said.
   H e knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had asked
the question twenty times, each time with twenty blows, I believe my baby
heart would have burst before I would have told him so.
    " You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow," he said, with
 a grave smile that belonged to him, and you understood me very well, I
 see. Wash that face, sir, and come down with me "
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           35
    He pointed to the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like
Mrs. Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. I
had little doubt then, and I have less doubt now, that he would have
knocked me down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated.
    " Clara, my dear," he said, when I had done his bidding, and he walked
me into the parlor, with his hand still on my arm ; "you will not be made
uncomfortable any more, I hope. We shall soon improve our youthful
humours."
    God help me, I might have been improved for my whole life, I might
have been made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind word at that
season. A word of encouragement and explanation, of pity for my
childish ignorance, of welcome home, of reassurance to me that it was
home, might have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth, instead
of in my hypocritical outside, and might have made me respect instead of
hate him. I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the
room so scared and strange, and that, presently, when I stole to a chair,
she followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still-missing, perhaps,
some freedom in my childish tread-but the word was not spoken, and
the time for it was gone.
    We dined alone, we three together. He seemed to be very fond of
my mother-I am afraid I liked him none the better for that-and she
was very fond of him. I gathered from what they said, that an elder
sister of his was coming to stay with them, and that she was expected
that evening. I am not certain whether I found out then, or afterwards,
that, without being actively concerned in any business, he had some share
in, or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant's house in
London, with which his family had been connected from his great-grand-
father's time, and in which his sister had a similar interest; but I may
mention it in this place, whether or no.
    After dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating
an escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, lest
it should offend the master of the house, a coach drove up to the
garden-gate, and he went out to receive the visitor. My mother followed
him. I was timidly following her, when she turned round at the parlor-
door, in the dusk, and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to
do, whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him. She
did this hurriedly and secretly, as if it were wrong, but tenderly; and,
putting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came near to
where he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and drew
her's through his arm.
    I t was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady
she was ; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in face and
voice ; and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her large nose, as
if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers, she had
 carried them to that account. She brought with her, two uncompromising
 hard black boxes, with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails.
 When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel
 purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon
 her arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite. I had never, at that
 time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was.
                                     D 2
36            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   She was brought into the parlor with many tokens of welcome, and
there formally recognised my mother as a new and near relation. Then
 she looked at me, and said :
    cc I s that your boy, sister-in-law ? "
   My mother acknowledged me.
    c c Generally speaking," said Miss Murdstone, '< I don't like boys.
 How d' ye do, boy ? "
   Under these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very well,
 and that I hoped she was the same; with such an indifferent grace, that
 Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words :
    '' Wants manner !"
   Having uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the favor of
being shewn to her room, which became to me from that time forth a
place of awe and dread, wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or
known to be left unlocked, and where (for I peeped in once or twice when
she was out) numerous little steel fetters and rivets, with which Miss
Murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed, generally hung
upon the looking-glass in formidable array.
   As well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no
intention of ever going again. She began to " helpJ' my mother next
morning, and was in and out of the store-closet all day, putting things to
rights, and making havoc in the old arrangements. Almost the first
 remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was, her being constantly
 haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere
 on the premises. Under the influence of this delusion, she dived into the
 coal-cellar at the most untimely hours, and scarcely ever opened the door
 of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again, in the belief that she
 had got him.
    Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she was a
 perfect Lark in point of getting up. She was up (and, as I believe to this
 hour, looking for that man) before anybody in the house was stirring.
 Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one eye open ;
but I could not concur in this idea ; for I tried it myself after hearing the
 suggestion thrown out, and found it couldn't be done.
   On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her
bell at cock-crow. When my mother came down to breakfast and was
going to make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the
cheek, which was her nearest approach to a kiss, and said :
   " Now, Clara, my dear, I am come here, you know, to relieve you of all

the trouble I can. You're much too pretty and thoughtlessJJ-my mother
blushed but laughed, and seemed not to dislike this character-" to have
any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me. If you'll be
so good as give me your keys, my dear, 1'11 attend to all this sort of thing
in future."
   From that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all
day, and under her pillow all night, and my mother had no more to do
with them than I had.
   My mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a
shadow of protest. One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing
certain household plans to her brother, of which he signified his approba-
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           37
 tion, my mother suddenly began to cry, and said she thought she might
 have been consulted.
     '< Clara!" said Mr. Murdstone sternly.     " Clara ! I wonder at you."

      " Oh, it's very well to say you wonder, Edward !" cried my mother,
   and it's very well for you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn't like
it yourself."
    Firmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both Mr. and
Miss Murdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed my
 comprehension of it at that time, if I had been called upon, I nevertheless
 did clearly comprehend in my own way, that it was another name for
tyranny ; and for a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil's humour, that was in
them both. The creed, as I should state it now, was this. Mr. Murd-
stone was firm ; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr. Murdstone ;
nobody else in his world was to be firm at all, for everybody was to be
bent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone was an exception. She might be
firm, but only by relationship, and in an inferior and tributary degree. My
mother was another exception. She might be firm, and must be; but
 only in bearing their firmness, and firmly believing there was no other
firmness upon earth.
    " It's very hard," said my mother, "that in my own house-"

    "My own house?" repeated Mr. Murdstone. " Clara!"
    " Our own house, I mean," faltered my mother, evidently frightened
-" I hope you must know what I mean, Edward-it 's very hard that in
your own house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters.
I am sure I managed very well before we were married. There's evi-
dence," said my mother, sobbing ; " ask Peggotty if I didn't do very well
when I wasn't interfered with !"
    " Edward," said Miss Murdstone, " let there be an end of this. I go
to-morrow."
    " Jane Murdstone,"      said her brother, "be silent ! How dare you to
insinuate that you don't know my character better than your words imply ? "
    " I am sure," my poor mother went on, at a grievous disadvantage, and
with many tears, " I don't want anybody to go. I should be very
miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go. I don't ask much. I am
not unreasonable. I only want to be consulted sometimes. I am very
much obliged to anybody who assists me, and I only want to be consulted
as a mere form, sometimes. I thought you were pleased, once, with my
being a little inexperienced and girlish, Edward-I am sure you said so-
but you seem to hate me for it now, you are so severe."
    " Edward," said Miss Murdstone,-again,- - " let there be an end of this.
I go to-moGow."
    c c Jane Murdstone," thundered Mr. Murdstone.       "Will you be silent?
How dare you ? "
    Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief, and
held it before her eyes.
    " Clara," he continued, looking at my mother, " you surprise me ! You

 astound me ! Yes, I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying an
 inexperienced and artless person, and forming her character, and infusing
 into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it stood in
 need. But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition something
like a housekeeper's, and when she meets with a base return-"
   " Oh, pray, pray, Edward," cried my mother, " don't accuse me of being

ungrateful. I am sure I am not ungrateful. No one ever said I was,
before. I have many faults, but not that. Oh, don't, my dear !"
   "When Jane Murdstone meets, I say," he went on, after waiting until
my mother was silent, "with a base return, that feeling of mine is chilled
and altered."
   "Don't, my love, say that!" implored my mother, very piteously.
" Oh, don't, Edward ! I can't bear to hear it. Whatever I am, I am
affectionate. I know I am affectionate. I wouldn't say it, if I wasn't
certain that I am. Ask Peggotty. I am sure she '11 tell you I 'm &ec-
tionate."
   "There is no extent of mere weakness, Clara," said Mr. Murdstone in
reply, "that can have the least weight with me. You lose breath."
   " Pray let us be friends," said my mother, " I couldn't live under
coldness or unkindness. I am so sorry. I have a great many defects, I
know, and it's very good of you, Edward, with your strength of mind, to
endeavour to correct them for me. Jane, I don't object to anything.
I should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving-"          My
mother was too much overcome to go on.
   " Jane Murdstone," said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, " any harsh words
between us are, I hope, uncommon. I t is not my fault that so unusual an
occurrence has taken place to-night. I was betrayed into it by another.
Nor is it your fault. You were betrayed into it by another. Let us
both try to forget it. And as this," he added, after these magnanimous
words, " is not a fit scene for the boy-David, go to bed ! "
   I could hardly find the door, through the tears that stood in my eyes.
I was so sorry for my mother's distress ; but I groped my way out, and
groped my way up to my room in the dark, without even having the
heart to say good night to Peggotty, or to get a candle from her. When
her coming up to look for me, an hour or so afterwards, awoke me,
 she said that my mother had gone to bedpoorly, and that Mr. and Miss
Murdstone were sitting alone.
   Going down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside
the parlor-door, on hearing my mother's voice. She was very earnestly
and humbly entreating Miss Murdstone's pardon, which that lady granted,
and a perfect reconciliation took place. I never knew my mother after-
wards to give an opinion on any matter, without first appealing to Miss
Murdstone, or without having first ascertained, by some sure means, what
Miss Murdstone's opinion was ; and I never saw Miss Murdstone, when out
of temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towards her bag as if
she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my
mother, without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright.
   The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the
Murdstone religion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought,
since, that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of
Mr. Murdstone's firmness, which wouldn't allow him to let any body off
from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse
for. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous visages with
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

which we used to go to church, and the changed air of the place. Again,
the dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file into the old pew first,
like a guarded captive brought to a condemned service. Again, Miss
Murdstone, in a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made
out of a pall, follows close upon me; then my mother; then her
 husband. There is no Peggotty now, as in the old time. Again, I listen
to Miss Murdstone mumbling the responses, and emphasising all the
 dread words with a cruel relish. Again, I see her dark eyes roll round the
church when she says "miserable sinners," as if she were calling all
the congregation names. Again, I catch rare glimpses of my mother,
moving her lips timidly between the two, with one of them muttering at
each ear like low thunder. Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether
it is likely that our good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and Miss
Murdstone right, and that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels.
Again, if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone
pokes me with her prayer-book, and makes my side ache.
   Yes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking at my
mother, and at me, and whispering. Again, as the three go on arm-in-arm,
and I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, and wonder if my
mother's step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the gaiety of
her beauty be really almost worried away. Again, I wonder whether any
of the neighbours call to mind, as I do, how we used to walk home
together, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that, all the dreary
dismal day.
   There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-
school. Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had
of course agreed with them. Nothing, however, was concluded on the
subject yet. I n the meantime, I learnt lessons at home.
   Shall I ever forget those lessons ! They were presided over nominally
by my mother, but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister, who were always
present, and found them a favourable occasion for giving my mother
lessons in that miscalled firmness, which was the bane of both our lives.
I believe I was kept at home, for that purpose. I had been apt enough to
learn, and willing enough, when my mother and I had lived alone together.
I can faintly remember learning the alphabet at her knee. To this day,
when I look upon the fat black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty
of their shapes, and the easy good-nature of 0 and Q and S, seem to
present themselves again before me as they used to do. But they recall no
feeling of disgust or reluctance. On the contrary, I seem to have walked
along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book, and to have been
cheered by the gentleness of my mother's voice and manner all the way.
But these solemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember as the death-
blow at my peace, and a grievous daily drudgery and misery. They were
very long, very numerous, very hard-perfectly unintelligible, some of
them, to me-and I was generally as much bewildered by them as I
believe my poor mother was herself.
   Let me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back
again.
   I come into the second-best parlor after breakfast, with my books,
and an exercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for me at her
40             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 writing-desk, but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair by the
 window (though he pretends to be reading a book), or as Miss Murdstone,
 sitting near my mother stringing steel beads. The very sight of these
 two has such an influence over me, that I begin to feel the words I have
 been at infinite pains to get into my head, all sliding away, and going I
 don't know where. I wonder where they do go, by-the-by ?
     I hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps it is a grammar, perhaps
 a history, or geography. I take a last drowning look at the page as I give
 it into her hand, and start off aloud at a racing pace while I have got it
 fresh. I trip over a word. Mr. Murdstone looks up. I trip over
 another word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden, tumble over half-a-
 dozen words, and stop. I think my mother would show me the book if
she dared, but she does not dare, and she says softly :
    " Oh, Davy, Davy! "

    " Now, Clara," says Mr. Murdstone, "be firm with the boy. Don't
say ' Oh, Davy, Davg !' That's childish. He knows his lesson, or he does
n i t know it.""
    " H e does not know it," Miss Murdstone interposes awfully.
    "I am really afraid he does not," says my mother.
    "Then you see, Clara," returns Miss Murdstone, "you should just
give him the book back, and make him know it."
    " Yes, certainly," says my mother ; " that is what I intend to do, my
dear Jane. Now, Davy, try once more, and don't be stupid."
    I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, but am
not so successful with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble down
before I get to the old place, at a point where I was all right before, and
 stop to think. But I can't think about the lesson. I think of the
number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's cap, or of the price of
Mr. Murdstone's dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem that I
have no business with, and don't want to have anything at all to do with.
Mr. Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been
expecting for a long time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My mother
glances submissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear
to be worked out when my other tasks are done.
    There is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling
snowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so
hopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that I
give up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The
despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other, as I blunder
on, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect in these miserable lessons
is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries to give me
the cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss Murdstone, who has
been lying in wait for nothing else all along, says in a deep warning voice :
    '' Clara ! "
    My mother starts, colors, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes
out of his chair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes my ears with
it, and turns me out of the room by the shoulders.
    Even when the lessons are done, the worst is yet to happen, in the shape
of an appalling sum. This is invented for me, and delivered to me
orally by Mr. Murdstone, and begins, " I f I go into a cheesemonger's
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

shop, and buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-
halfpenny each, present payment "-at          which I see Miss Murdstone
secretly overjoyed. I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlighten-
ment until dinner-time ; when, having made a Mulatto of myself by getting
the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin, I have a slice of bread to
help me out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace for the rest
of the evening.
    I t seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies
generally took this course. I could have done very well if I had been without
the Murdstones ;but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the
fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird. Even when I did get
through the morning with tolerable credit, there was not much gained but
dinner; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me untasked, and
if I rashly made any show of being unemployed, called her brother's
attention to me by saying, " Clara, my dear, there's nothing like work-
give your boy an exercise;" which caused me to be clapped down to some
new labor, there and then. As to any recreation with other children of
my age, I had very little of that; for the gloomy theology of the
Murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers (though
there was a child once set in the midst of the Disciples), and held that
they contaminated one another.
   The natural result of this treatment, continued, I suppose, for some six
months or more, was to make me sullen, dull, and dogged. I was not
made the less so, by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and
alienated from my mother. I believe I should have been almost stupified
but for one circumstance.
   I t was this. My father had left a small collection of books in a little room
up-stairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my own) and which nobody
else in our house ever troubled. From that blessed little room, Roderick
Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, The Vicar of
Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and RobinsonCrusoe, came out, a glorious
host, to keep me company. They kept alive my fancy, and my hope of some-
thing beyond that place and time,-they, and the Arabian Nights, and the
Tales of the Genii,-and did me no harm ; for whatever harm was in some
of them was not there for me ;I knew nothing of it. It is astonishing to
me now, how I found time, in the midst of my porings and blunderings
 over heavier themes, to read those books as I did. I t is curious to me
 how I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles (which
 were great troubles to me), by impersonating my favorite characters in
 them-as I did-and by putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone into all the bad
 ones-which I did too. I have been Tom Jones (a child's Tom Jones,
 a harmless creature) for a week together. I have sustained my own idea
 of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I verily believe. I had a
 greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and Travels-I forget what,
 now-that were on those shelves ; and for days and days I can remember
 to have gone about my region of our house, armed with the centre-piece
out of an old set of boot-trees-the perfect realisation of Captain Somebody,
 of the Royal British Navy, in danger of being beset by savages, and
resolved to sell his life at a great price. The Captain never lost dignity,
from having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar. I did ; but the
42            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 Captain was a Captain and a hero, in despite of all the grammars of all
 the languages in the world, dead or alive.
    This was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, the
 picture always rises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys at play in
 the churchyard, and I sitting onmy bed, reading as if for life. Every barn
in the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every foot of the
 churchyard, had some association of its own, in my mind, connected with
 these books, and stood for some locality made famous in them. I have
 seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple ; I have watched Strap,
with the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest himself upon the wicket-
gate; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club with
Mr. Pickle, in the parlor of our little village alehouse.
    The reader now understands as well as I do, what I was when I came
to that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again.
   One morning when I went into the parlor with my books, I found
my mother looking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr.
Murdstone binding something round the bottom of a cane-a lithe and
limber cane, which he left off binding when I came in, and poised and
switched in the air.
   " I tell you, Clara," said Mr. Murdstone, "I have been often flogged
myself."
   " To be sure ; of course," said Miss Murdstone.
    " Certainly, my dear Jane," faltered my mother, meekly. " But-but
do you think it did Edward good ?"
    "Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?" asked Mr. Murdstone,
gravely.
    "That's the point !" said his sister.
   T o this my mother returned, "Certainly, my dear Jane," and saidno more.
    I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue,
and sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine.
    "Now, David," he said-and I saw that cast again, as he saidit-" you
must be far more careful to-day than usual." H e gave the cane another
poise, and another switch; and having finished his preparation of it, laid it
down beside him, with an expressive look, and took up his book.
   This was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning. I
felt the words of my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or line by line,
but by the entire page. I tried to lay hold of them ;but they seemed, if I
may so express it, to have put skates on, and to skim away from me with a
smoothness there was no checking.
   We began badly, and went on worse. I had come in, with an idea of
distinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared ;
but it turned out to be quite a mistake. Book after book was added to
the heap of failures, Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the
time. And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses (canes he
made it that day, I remember), my mother burst out crying.
    " Clara ! " said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice.
    " I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think," said my mother.
   I saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he rose and said, taking up
the cane :
    "Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect firmness,
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          43
the worry and torment that David has occasioned her to-day. That
would be stoical. Clara is greatly strengthened and improved, but we
can hardly expect so much from her. David, you and I will go up-stairs,
boy."
   As he took me out at the door, my mother ran towards us. Miss
3Iurdstone said, " Clara ! are you a perfect fool ? " and interfered. I saw
my mother stop her ears then, and I heard her crying.
   H e walked me up to my room slowly and gravely-I am certain he
had a delight in that formal parade of executing justice-and when we
got there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.
   " Mr. Murdstone ! Sir !" I cried to him.     "Don't ! Pray don't beat
me ! I have tried to learn, sir, but I ean't learn while you and Miss
Murdstone are by. I ean't indeed ! "
   " Can't you, indeed, David?" he said. " We 1' 1 try that."
   H e had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and
stopped him for a moment, entreating him not to beat me. I t was only
for a moment that I stopped him, for he cut me heavily an instant
afterwards, and in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held
me in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit it through. I t sets my teeth
on edge to think of it.
   He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death. Above all
the noise we made, I heard them running up the stairs, and crying out-
I heard my mother crying out-and Peggotty. Then he was gone ; and
the door was locked outside ; and I was lying, fevered and hot, and torn,
and sore, and raging in my puny way, upon the floor.
   How well I recollect, when I became quiet, what an unnatural stillness
seemed to reign through the whole house ! How well I remember, when
my smart and passion began to cool, how wicked I began to feel !
   I sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. I crawled
up from the floor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and ugly,
that it almost frightened me. My stripes were sore and stiff, and made me
cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I felt. I t
lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal, I
dare say.
   I t had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (Ihad been lying,
for the most part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing,
and looking listlessly out), when the key was turned, and Miss Murdstone
came in with some bread and meat, and milk. These she put down upon
the table without a word, glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness,
and then retired, locking the door after her.
   Long after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else
would come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed,
and went to bed ; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully what would be
 done to me. Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed?
Whether I should be taken into custody, and sent to prison? Whether
I was at all in danger of being hanged?
   I never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and
fresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale
and dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared
before I was out of bed; told me, in so many words, that I was free to
44            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

walk in the garden for half an hour and no longer ; and retired, leaving
the door open, that I might avail myself of that permission.
    I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted
five days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone
 down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one,
Miss Murdstone excepted, during the whole time-except at evening
prayers in the parlor; to which I was escorted by Miss &turdstone after
 everybody else was placed; where I was stationed, a young outlaw, all
 alone by myself near the door; and whence I was solemnly conducted by
my jailer, before anyone arose from the devotional posture. I only
 observed that my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept
her face another way so that I never saw it; and that Mr. $turdstone's
hand was bound up in a large linen wrapper.
    The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one.
They occupy the place of years in my remembrance. The way in which
I listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible
to me; the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the
murmuring of voices, the footsteps on the stairs; to any laughing,
whistling, or singing, outside, which seemed more dismal than anything
else to me in my solitude and disgrace-the uncertain pace of the hours,
especially at night, when I would wake thinking it was morning, and
find that the family were not yet gone to bed, and that all the length of
night had yet to come-the depressed dreams and nightmares I had-the
return of day, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the
churchyard, and I watched them from a distance within the room, being
ashamed to show myself at the window lest they should know I was a
prisoner-the       strange sensation of never hearing myself speak-the
fleeting intervals of something like cheerfulness, which came with eating
and drinking, and went away with it-the setting in of rain one evening,
with a fresh smell, and its coming down faster and faster between me
and the church, until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in
gloom, and fear, and remorse-all this appears to have gone round and
round for years instead of days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on
my remembrance.
    On the last night of my restraint, I was awakened by hearing my own
name spoken in a whisper. I started up in bed, and putting out my arms
in the dark, said :
    " I s that you, Peggotty ? "
   There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again,
in a tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone
into a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the
keyhole.
    I groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole,
whispered :
    " I s that you, Peggotty, dear?"
    "Yes, my own precious Davy," she replied. "Be as soft as a mouse,
or the Cat '11 hear us."
   I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the
urgency of the case ; her room being close by.
    " How's mama, dear Peggotty ?       Is she very angry with me? "
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            45
     I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, as I was
doing on mine, before she answered. "No. Not very."
     " What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear ?      Do you know ? "
     " School. Near London," was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to get
her to repeat it, for she spoke it the f i s t time quite down my throat, in
consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the key-
hole and put my ear there ; and though her words tickled me a good deal,
I didn't hear them.
     cr When, Peggotty ? "
      " TO-morrow."

     "Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my
drawers ?" which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention it.
     " Yes," said Peggotty. " Box."
     " Shan't I see mama ? "
     " Yes," said Peggotty. " Morning."
     Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole, and delivered these
words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has
ever been the medium of communicating, I will venture to assert : shoot-
ing in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own.
     " Davy, dear.   If I ain't ben azackly as intimate with you. Lately, as I
used to be. I t ain't becase I don't love you. Just as well and more, my
pretty poppet. It's because I thought it better for you. And for some one
else besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening ? Can you hear ? "
     " Ye-ye-ye-yes,       Peggotty !" I sobbed.
     " My own !" said Peggotty, with infinite compassion. " What I want
to say, is. That you must never forget me. For I 1' 1 never forget you. And
I 1' 1 take as much care of your mama, Davy. As ever I took of you. And I
won't leave her. The day may come when she '11 be glad to lay her poor
head. On her stupid, cross old Peggotty's arm again. And I'll write to
you, my dear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I 'll-I 'll-"            Peggotty
fell to kissing the keyhole, as she couldn't kiss me.
     "Thank you, dear Peggotty !" said I. <' Oh, thank you ! Thank
you ! Will you promise me one thing, Peggotty ? Will you write and
tell Mr. Peggotty and little Em'ly and &s. Gummidge and Ham, that
I am not so bad as they might suppose, and that I sent 'em all my love-
especially to little Em'ly ? Will you, if you please, Peggotty ?"
     The kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the
greatest affection-I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had been
her honest face-and parted. From that night there grew up in my
breast, a feeling for Peggotty, which I cannot very well define. She did
not replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into a
vacancy in my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards her some-
thing I have never felt for any other human being. I t was a sort of comical
affection too ; and yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should have
done, or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been
to me.
     I n the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was
going to school; which was not altogether such news to me as she
supposed. She also informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come
down-stairs into the parlor, and have my breakfast. There, I found my
              THX PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

mother, very pale and with red eyes : into whose arms I ran, and begged
her pardon from my suffering soul.
  c c Oh, Davy !" she said. " That you could hurt any one I love ! Try to
be better, pray to be better ! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, Davy,
that you should have such bad passions in your heart."
   They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was more
sorry for that, than for my going away. I felt it sorely. I tried to eat
my parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter,
and trickled into my tea. I saw my mother look at me sometimes,
and then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and then look down, or
look away.
   " Master Copperfield's box there !" said Miss Murdstone, when wheels

were heard at the gate.
   I looked for Peggotty, but it was not she ; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone
appeared. My former acquaintance, the carrier, was at the door; the
box was taken out to his cart, and lifted in.
   " Clara ! " said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note.

   "Ready, my dear Jane," returned my mother. " Good bye, Davy.
You are going for your own good. Good bye, my child. You will come
home in the holidays, and be a better boy."
   " Clara !" Miss Murdstone repeated.
   " Certainly, my dear Jane," replied my mother, who was holding me.

" I forgive you, my dear boy.     God bless you ! "
   " Clara ! " Miss Murdstone repeated.

   Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to
say on the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad
end; and then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it.




                             CHAPTER V.
                     I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME.
  WE might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was
quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short.
  Looking out to ascertain what for, I saw, to my amazement, Peggotty
burst from a hedge and climb into the cart. She took me in both her
arms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was
extremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I
found it very tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing
one of her arms, she put it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought
out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a
purse which she put into my hand, but not one word did she say. After
another and a final squeeze with both arms, she got down from the cart
and ran away; and, my belief is, and has always been, without a solitary
button on her gown. I picked up one, of several that were rolling about,
and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.
   The carrier looked at me, as if to enquire if she were coming back.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

I shook my head, and said I thought not. "Then come up," said the
carrier to the lazy horse ; who came up accordingly.
   Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think
it was of no use crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random,
nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I could
remember, in trying situations. The carrier, seeing me in this resolution,
proposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon the horse's
back to dry. I thanked him, and assented; and particularly small it
looked, under those circumstances.
   I had now leisure to examine the purse. I t was a stiff leather
purse, with a snap, and had three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty
had evidently polished up with whitening, for my greater delight. But
its most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit of
paper, on which was written, in my mother's hand, "For Davy. With my
love." I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrier to be so good
as reach me my pocket-handkerchief again ; but he said he thought I had
better do without it ; and I thought I really had ; so I wiped my eyes
on my sleeve and stopped myself.
   For good, too ; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was
still occasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for
some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way.
   " All the way where ? " enquired the carrier.
   "There," I said.
   "Where 's there ? " enquired the carrier.
   " Near London ? " I said.
   "Why that horse," said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out,
"would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground."
   " Are you only going to Yarmouth then ? " I asked.

   " That's about it, " said the carrier. " And there I shall take you to
the stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch that 1' 1 take you to-wherever it is. "
   As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis)
to say-he     being, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic
temperament, and not at all conversational-I offered him a cake as a
mark of attention, which he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant, and
which made no more impression on his big face than it would have done
on an elephant's.
   " Did she make 'em, now ? " said Xlr. Barkis, always leaning forward,

in his slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each
knee.
   " Peggotty, do you mean, sir ? "
    " Ah ! " said Mr. Barkis.      Her. "
    " Yes.   She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking. "
    " Do she though? " said Mr. Barkis.
   H e made up his mouth as if to whistle, but he didn't whistle. H e sat
looking at the horse's ears, as if he saw something new there ;and sat so,
for a considerable time. By-and-by, he said :
   " NO sweethearts, I b'lieve ? "
   " Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis? " For I thought he wanted
something else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of
refreshment.
48             THE PERSONAL HISTORY ATID EXPERIENCE

  " Hearts, " said Mr.Barkis. " Sweet hearts; no person walks with her !"
  " With Peggotty ? "

  " Ah !" he said. " Her. "
  " Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart. "
  " Didn't she though ! " said Mr. Barkis.
    Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle,
but sat looking at the horse's ears.
     " So she makes," said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection,
" all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she ? "
    I replied that such was the fact.
    " Well.    I'll tell yon what, " said Mr. Barkis. " P'raps you might be
writin' to her ? "
    " I shall certainly write to her, " I rejoined.

    " Ah ! " he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. " Well ! If you
was writin' to her, p'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin' ;
would YOU. "
    " That Barkis is willing, " I repeated, innocently.     " I s that all the
message ? "
    " Ye-es, " he said, considering. " Ye-es.         Barkis is willin'. "
    cr But you will be at Blunderstone again to-morrow, Mr. Barkis, " I
said, faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, " and
could give your own message so much better. "
    As he repudiated this suggestion, however, with a jerk of his head, and
once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound gravity,
c r Barkis is willin'.      That's the message," I readily undertook its
transmission. While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel at Yarmouth
that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paper and an inkstand, and
wrote a note to Peggotty which ran thus : " My dear Peggotty. I have
come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama. Yours aEec-
tionately. P. S. H e says he particularly wants you to know-Barkis is
willing. "
    When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis
relapsed into perfect silence ;and I, feeling quite worn out by all that had
happened lately, lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I slept
soundly until we got to Yarmouth ;which was so entirely new and strange
to me in the inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once abandoned a
latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty's family
there, perhaps even with little Enl'ly herself.
    The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without
any horses to i t as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more
unlikely than its ever going to London. I was thinking this, and
wondering what would ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis
had put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up
the yard to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately become of me,
when a lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of
meat were hanging up, and said :
     " Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone? "
     "Yes, ma'am," I said.
     "What name ? " enquired the lady.
     " Copperfield, ma'am," I said.
                         O F DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    "That won't do," returned the lady. " Nobody's dinner is paid for
 here, in that name."
    " I s it Murdstone, ma'am 3 " I said.

    " If you're Master Murdstone," said the lady, "why do you go and

 give another name, first ? "
    I explained to the lady how it was, who then rang a bell, and called
 out, "William ! show the coffee-room ! " upon which a waiter came
running out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it,
and seemed a good deal surprised when he found he was only to show
it to me.
    I t was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I
 could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries,
 and I cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to
 sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the
 door; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set
of castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty.
    H e brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in
such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some
 offence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at
the table, and saying, very affably, " Now, six-foot ! come on ! "
    I thanked him, and took my seat at the board ; but found it extremely
difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity,
or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing
opposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful
manner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second
chop, he said :
    " There's half a pint of ale for you.  Will you have it now ? "
    I thanked him, and said "Yes." Upon which he poured it out of a jug into
a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, andmade it look beautiful.
    " My eye ! " he said. " I t seems a good deal, don't i t ? "
    " I t does seem a good deal," I answered with a smile.    For it was quite
delightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed, pimple-
faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and as he
stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with the
other hand, he looked quite friendly.
    " There was a gentleman here, yesterday," he said-"    a stout gentleman,
by the name of Topsawyer-perhaps you know him!"
    " No," I said, " I don't think-"
    " I n breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled
choaker," said the waiter.
    "No," I said bashfully, "I haven't the pleasure-"
    " He came in here," said the waiter, looking at the light through the

tumbler, " ordered a glass of this ale-would order it-I told him not-
drank it, and fell dead. I t was too old for him. I t oughtn't to be
drawn ; that 's the fact."
    I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said
I thought I had better have some water.
    "Why you see," said the waiter, still looking at the light through the
tumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, " our people don't like things being
ordered and left. I t offends 'em. But I ' l l drink it, if you like. I'm
                                                                 E
50             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

used to it, and use is everything. I don't think it '11 hurt me, if I throw
my head back, and take it off quick. Shall I ? "
   I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought he
could do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his
head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess, of seeing
him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall lifeless on the
carpet. But it didn't hurt him. On the contrary, I thought he seemed
the fresher for it.
   " What have we got here ? " he said, putting a fork into my dish. " Not
chops ? "
   " Chops," I said.

   "Lord bless my soul ! " he exclaimed, "I didn't know they were chops.
Why, a chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer !
Ain't it lucky 2 "
   So he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the other,
and ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction. H e
afterwards took another chop, and another potato ; and after that, another
chop and another potato. When we had done, he brought me a pudding,
and having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent i n
his mind for some moments.
   "How's the pie? " he said, rousing himself.
   " It's a pudding," I made answer.
   "Pudding ! " he exclaimed. " Why, bless me, so it is ! What ! "
looking at it nearer. "You don't mean to say i t 's a batter-pudding ! "
   'I Yes, it is indeed."

   "Why, a batter-pudding," he said, taking up a table-spoon, ''$ my
favorite pudding! Ain't that lucky ? Come on, little 'un, and let s see
who 'll get most."
   The waiter certainly got most. H e entreated me more than once to
 come in and win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his
dispatch to my dispatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I was left far
behind at the first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw
any one enjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was
all gone, as if his enjoyment of it lasted still.
   Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I
asked for the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty. He not only
brought it immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I
wrote the letter. When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going
to school.
   I said, "Near London," which was all I knew.
   " Oh, my eye !" he said, looking very low-spirited, " I am sorry for that."
   " Why ?" I asked him.
   " Oh, Lord ! " he said, shaking his head, " that's the school where they
broke the boy's ribs-two ribs-a little boy he was. I should say he
was-let me see-how old are you, about?"
   I told him between eight and nine.
   " That's just his age," he said. " H e was eight years and six months
old when they broke his first rib ; eight years and eight months old when
they broke his second, and did for him."
   I could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this was an
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            51
uncomfortable coincidence, and enquired how it was done. His answer was
not cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, "With
whopping."
   The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion,
which made me get up and hesitatingly enquire, in the mingled pride and
diffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there
were anything to pay.
   "There's a sheet of letter-paper," he returned. " Did you ever buy a
sheet of letter-paper ? "
   I could not remember that I ever had.
   "It 'S dear," he said, " on account of the duty. Threepence. That's
the way we're taxed in this country. There's nothing else, except the
waiter. Never mind the ink. I l o s e by that.''
   .'What should you-what should I-how much ought I to-what
would i t be right to pay the waiter, if you please? " I stammered, blushing.
   "If I hadn't a family, and that family hadn't the cowpock," said the
waiter, "I wouldn't take a sixpence. If I didn't support a aged pairint,
and a lovely sister,"-here the waiter was greatly agitated-" I wouldn't
take a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated well here, I should
beg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking of it. But I live on broken
wittles-and I sleep on the coals "-here the waiter burst into tears.
   I was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that any recog-
nition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart.
Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he received
with much humility and veneration, and spun up with his thumb, directly
afterwards, to try the goodness of.
   I t was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up
behind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without
any assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in the bow-
window, say to the guard, "Take care of that child, George, or he 1' 1
burst ! " and from observing that the women-servants who were about the
place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon. My
unfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite recovered his spirits, did not
appear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admiration
without being at all confused. If I had any doubt of him, I suppose this
half-awakened it ; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple con-
fidence of a child, and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years
(qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for
worldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole,
even then.
   I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it, the
subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing
heavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and as to the greater expe-
diency of my travelling by waggon. The story of my supposed appetite
getting wind among the outside passengers, they were merry upon it
likewise ;and asked me whether I was going to be paid for, at school, as two
brothers or three, and whether I was contracted for, or went upon the
regular terms; with other pleasant questions. But the worst of it
was, that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything, when an oppor-
tunity offered, and that, after a rather light dinner, I should remain hungry
                                      E 2
.J   2        THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

all night-for I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My
apprehensions were realised. When we stopped for supper I couldn't
muster courage to take any, though I should have liked it very much, but
sat by the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did not save me
from more jokes, either ; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face,
who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way, except
when he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I was like a boa
constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time ; after
which, he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef.
    We had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, and
we were due in London about eight next morning. I t was Midsummer
weather, and the evening was very pleasant. When we passed through a
village, I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like, and
what the inhabitants were about; and when boys came running after us,
and got up behind and swung there for a little way, I wondered whether
their fathers were alive, and whether they were happy at home. I had plenty
to think of, therefore, besides my mind running continually on the kind of
place I was going to-which was an awful speculation. Sometimes,I remem-
ber, I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty ; and to endeavour-
ing, in a confused blind way, to recall how I had felt, and what sort of boy
I used to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone : which I couldn't satisfy myself
about by any means, I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity.
    The night was not so pleasant as the evening, for it got chilly; and
being put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) to
 prevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by their
 falling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard
 sometimes, that I could not help crying out, " Oh ! If you please ! "
 -which they didn't like at all, because it woke them. Opposite me was
 an elderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked in the dark more like a
 haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady
 had a basket with her, and she hadn't known what to do with it, for a
 long time, until she found that on account of my legs being short, it could
 go underneath me. I t cramped and hurt me so, that it made me per-
 fectly miserable ; but if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was
 in the basket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave
 me the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, '< Come, don't you fidget.
 Yow bones are young enough, I ' m sure! "
    At last the sun rose, and then my companions seemed to sleep easier.
 The difficulties under which they had laboured all night, and which had
 found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts, are not to be con-
 ceived. As the sun got higher, their sleep became lighter, and so they
 gradually one by one awoke. I recollect being very much surprised by
 the feint everybody made, then, of not having been to sleep at all, and by
 the uncommon indignation with which every one repelled the charge. I
 labor under the same kind of astonishment to this day, having invariably
 observed that of all human weaknesses, the one to which our common
 nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine why) is the
 weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach.
    What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance,
 and how I believed all the adventures of all my favorite heroes to be
  constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it out
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            55
in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities
of the earth, I need not stop here to relate. We approached it by degrees,
and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district, for which we
were bound. I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or the Blue Boar ;
but I know it was the Blue Something, and that its likeness was painted
up on the back of the coach.
   The guard's eye lighted on me as he was getting down, and he said at
the booking-office door :
    " I s there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of & h d -

stone, from BIoonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called for ?"
   Nobody answered.
    " Try Copperfield, if you please, sir," said I, looking helplessly down.

    " I s there anybody here for a yoongster, booked in the name of Murd-
stone,from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name of Copperfield,
to be left till called for ?" said the guard. " Come ! 1s there anybody?"
   No. There was nobody. I looked anxiously around; but the enquiry
made no impression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in gaiters,
with one eye, who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round
my neck, and tie me up in the stable.
   A ladder was brought, and I got down after the lady, who was like a
haystack : fiot daring to stir, until her basket was removed. The coach
was clear of passengers by that time, the luggage was very soon cleared
out, the horses had been taken out before the luggage, and now the coach
itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out of the way. Still,
nobody appeared, to claim the dusty youngster fromBlunderstone, Suffolk.
   More solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had nobody to look at him
and see that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, and, by invita-
tion of the clerk on duty, passed behind the counter, and sat down on the
scale at which they weighed the luggage. Here, as I sat looking at the
parcels, packages, and books, and inhaling the smell of stables (ever since
associated with that morning), a procession of most tremendous considera-
tions began to march through my mind. Supposing nobody should ever
fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there? Would they
keep me long enough to spend seven shillings ? Should I sleep at night
in one of those wooden binns with the other luggage, and wash myself at
the pump in the yard in the morning; or should I be turned out every
night, and expected to come again to be left till called for, when the office
opened next day ? Supposing there was no mistake in the case, and Mr.
Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me, what should I do ? If
they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings were spent, I
couldn't hope to remain there when I began to starve. That would obviously
be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, besides entailing on the
Blue Whatever-it-was, the risk of funeral expenses. If I started off at
once, and tried to walk back home, how could I ever find my way, how
could I ever hope to walk so far, how could I make sure of any one but
Peggotty, even if I got back ? If I found out the nearest proper authori-
ties, and offered myself to go for a soldier, or a sailor, I was such a little
fellow that it was most likely they wouldn't take me in. These thoughts,
and a hundred other such thoughts, turned me burning hot, and made me
giddy with apprehension and dismay. I was in the height of my fever
54             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 when a man entered and whispered to the clerk, who presently slanted me
 off the scale, and pushed me over to him, as if I were weighed, bought,
 delivered, and paid for.
    As I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance,
 I stole a look at him. He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow
 cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr, Mnrdstone's; but there the
 likeness ended, for his whiskers were shaved off, and his hair, instead of
 being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressed in a suit of black clothes
 which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short in the sleeves and
 legs ; and he had a white neck-kerchief on that was not over-clean. I did
 not, and do not, suppose that this neck-kerchief was all the linen he wore,
 but it was all he showed or gave any hint of.
    " You 're the new boy ? " he said.

    " Yes, sir," I said.
    I supposed I was. I didn't know.
    "I 'm one of the masters at Salem House," he said.
    I made him a bow and felt very much overawed. I was so ashamed to
allude to a common-place thing like my box, to a scholar and a master at
Salem House, that we had gone some little distance from the yard before
I had the hardihood to mention it. We turned back, on my humbly
insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter ; and he told the clerk
that the carrier had instructions to call for it at noon.
    " If you please, sir," I said, when we had accomplished about the same
distance as before, " is it far ? "
    " It's down by Blackheath," he said.
    "Is that far, sir ? " I diffidently asked.
    "It's a good step," he said. "We shall go by the stage-coach. I t ' s
about six miles."
    I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles more,
was too much for me. I took heart to tell him that I had had nothing all
night, and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat, I should be
very much obliged to him. He appeared surprised at this-I see him stop
and look at me now-and after considering for a few moments, said he
wanted to call on an old person who lived not far 08,and that the best
way would be for me to buy some bread, or whatever I liked best that was
.rvholesome, and make my breakfast at her house, where we could get
some milk.
    Accordingly ure looked in at a baker's window, and after I had made a
series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and lie
had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of
brown bread, which cost me threepence. Then, at a grocer's shop, we
bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon ; which still left what I thought
a good deal of change, out of the second of the bright shillings, and made
me consider London a very cheap place. These provisions laid in, we went
on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond
description, and over a bridge which, no doubt, was London Bridge
(indeed I think he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to the
poor person's house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew by
their look, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate, which said they
were established for twenty-five poor women.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little
black doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned
window on one side, and another little diamond-paned window above ;
and we went into the little house of one of these poor old women, who was
blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil. On seeing the master enter, the
old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee, and said something that
I thought sounded like "My Charley ! " but on seeing me come in too,
she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey.
   " Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you please? "
said the Master at Salem House.
   " Can I ?" said the old woman. " Yes can I , sure !"
   " How's Mrs. Fibbitson to-day ?" said the Master, looldng at another
old woman in a large chair by the fire, who was such a bundle of clothes
that I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake.
   " Ah, she's poorly,"      said the first old woman. " I t 's one of her
bad days. If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe
she 'd go out too, and never come to life again."
   As they looked at her, I looked at her also. Although it was a warm
day, she seemed to think of nothing but the fire. I fancied she was jealous
even of the saucepan on it ; and I have reason to know that she took its
impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in
dudgeon; for I saw her, withmy own discomfited eyes, shake her fist at me
once, when those culinary operations were going on, and no one else was
looking. The sun streamed in at the little window, but she sat with her
own back and the back of the large chair towards it, screening the fire as if
she were sedulously keeping it warm, instead of it keeping her warm, and
watching it in a most distrustful manner. The completion of the prepara-
tions for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her such extreme joy that
she laughed aloud-and a very unmelodious laugh she had, I must say.
   I sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, with a
bason of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal. While I was yet
in the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house said to the Master :
   " Have you got your flute with you?"
   " Yes," he returned.
   " Have a blow at it," said the old woman, coaxingly. "Do !"
   The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat,
and brought out his flute in three pieces, which he screwed together, and
began immediately to play. My impression is, after many years of con-
sideration, that there never can have been anybody in the worId who
played worse. H e made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard pro-
duced by any means, natural or artificial. I don't know what the tunes
were-if there were such things in the performance at all, which I doubt
-but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make me think of
all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back; then to take
away my appetite; and lastly to make me so sleepy that I couldn't keep
my eyes open. They begin to close again, and I begin to nod, as the
recollection rises fresh upon me. Once more the little room with its
open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and its angular little
staircase leading to the room above, and its three peacock's feathers dis-
played over the mantelpiece-I remember wondering when I first went in,
56            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery
was doonied to come to-fades from before me, and I nod, and sleep.
The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard instead,
and I am on my journey. The coach jolts, I wake with a start, and the
flute has come back again, and the Master at Salem House is sitting with
his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old woman of the house
looks on delighted. She fades in her turn, and he fades, and all fades,
and there is no flute, no Master, no Salem House, no David Copperfield,
no anything but heavy sleep.
   I dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal
flute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him
in her ecstatic admiration, leaned over the back of his chair and gave him
an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing for a
moment. I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking, either
then or immediately afterwards ; for, as he resumed-it was a real fact
that he had stopped playing-I saw and heard the same old woman ask
Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs.
Fibbitson replied, '< Ay, ay ! Yes ! " and nodded at the fire : to which, I
am persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.
   When I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at Salem
House unscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them up as before,
and took me away. We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon
the roof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to
take up somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers,
and where I slept profoundly, until I found the coach going at a footpace
up a steep hill among green leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come
to its destination.
   A short walk brought us-I mean the Master and me-to Salem House,
which was enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very dull. Over a
door in this wall was a board with SALEMHOUSEupon it ; and through
a grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a
surly face, which I found, on the door being opened, belonged to a stout
man with a bull-neck, a wooden leg, overhanging temples, and his hair cut
close all round his head.
   " The new boy," said the Master.
   The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over-it didn't take long,
for there was not much of me-and locked the gate behind us, and took
out the key. We were going up to the house, among some dark heavy
trees, when he called after my conductor.
   " Hall0 ! "
   We looked back, and he was standing at the door of a little lodge, where
he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand.
   " Here ! The cobbler's been," he said, " since you 've been out,
Mr. Mell, and he says he can't mend 'em any more. H e says there an't
a bit of the original boot left, and he wonders you expect it."
   With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went back
a few paces to pick them up, and looked at them (very disconsolately,
I was afraid), as we went on together. I observed then, for the first
time, that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear, and
that his stocking was just breaking out in one place, like a bud.

    Salem House was a square brick building with wings ; of a bare and
unfurnished appearance. All about it was so very quiet, that I said to
Mr. Mell I supposed the boys were out ; but he seemed surprised at my not
knowing that it was holiday-time. That all the boys were at their several
homes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down by the sea-side with
Mrs. and Miss Creakle ; and that I was sent in holiday-time as a punish-
ment for my misdoing, all of which he explained to me as we went along.
   I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most
forlorn and desolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long room
with three long rows of desks, and six of forms, and bristling all round
with pegs for hats and slates. Scraps of old copybooks and exercises,
litter the dirty floor. Some silkworms' houses, made of the same materials,
are scattered over the desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind
by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of paste-
board and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything
to eat. A bird, in a cage a very little bigger than himself, makes a mournful
rattle now and then in hopping on his perch, two inches high, or dropping
from it ; but neither sings nor chirps. There is a strange unwholesome
smell upon the room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet apples wanting air,
and rotten books. There could not well be more ink splashed about it, if
it had been roofless from its first construction, and the skies had rained,
snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year.
   Mr. Me11 having left me while he took his irreparable boots up-stairs, I
went softly to the upper end of the room, observing all this as I crept
along. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written,
which was lying on the desk, and bore these words-" Take care of him.
H e bites."
   I got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great dog
underneath. But, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, I could
see nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering about, when Mr. Mell
came back, and asked me what I did up there.
   " I beg your pardon, sir," says I, <'   if you please, I 'm looking for the
dog."
   " Dog,? " says he. " What dog ? "
   " Isn t it a dog, sir ? "
   " Isn 't what a dog ? "
   " That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites."
   " No, Copperfield," says he gravely, " that's not a dog. That 's a boy.
My instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back. I am
sorry to make such a beginning with you, but I must do it."
   With that, he took me down, and tied the placard, which was neatly
constructed for the purpose, on my shoulders like a knapsack; and
wherever I went, afterwards, I had the consolation of carrying it.
   What I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine. Whether
it was possible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that
somebody was reading it. I t was no relief to turn round and find
nobody; for wherever my back was, there I imagined somebody always
to be. That cruel man with the wooden leg, aggravated my sufferings.
H e was in authority; and if he ever saw me leaning against a tree,
or a wall, or the house, he roared out from his lodge-door in a
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

stupendous voice, "Hallo, you sir ! You Copperfield! Show that
badge conspicuous, or I'll report you!"              The playground was a
bare gravelled yard, open to all the back of the house and the offices;
and I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher read it, and
the baker read i t ; that everybody, in a word, who came backwards
and forwaxds to the house, of a morning when I was ordered to walk
there, read that I was to be taken care of, for I bit. I recollect that I posi-
tively began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy who did bite.
   There was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had
a custom of carving their names. I t was completely covered with
such inscriptions. I n my dread of the end of the vacation and
their coming back, I could not read a boy's name, without enquiring
in what tone and with what emphasis he would read, "Take care
of him. H e bites." There was one boy-a               certain J. Steerforth-
who cut his name very deep and very often, who, I conceived, would
read it in a rather strong voice, and afterwards pull my hair. There
was another boy, one Tommy Traddles, who I dreaded would make game
of it, and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me. There was a third,
George Demple, who I fancied would sing it. I have looked, a little
shrinking creature, at that door, until the owners of all the names-there
were five-and-forty of them in the school then, Mr. Me11 said-seemed to
send me to Coventry by general acclamation, and to cry out, each in his
own way, '< Take care of him. He bites ! "
   I t was the same with the places at the desks and forms. I t was the
same with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my way to,
and when I was in, my own bed. I remember dreaming night after night,
of being with my mother as she used to be, or of going to a party at
Mr. Peggotty's, or of travelling outside the stage-coach, or of dining again
with my unfortunate friend the waiter, and in all these circumstances
making people scream and stare, by the unhappy disclosure that I had
nothing on but my little night-shirt, and that placard.
   I n the monotony of my life, and in my constant apprehension of the
reopening of the school, it was such an insupportable affliction ! I had
long tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, there being no
Mr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them without disgrace.
Before, and after them, I walked about-supervised, as I have mentioned,
by the man with the woodenleg. How vividly I call to mind the damp
about the house, the green cracked flagstones in the court, an old leaky
water-butt, and the discolored trunks of some of the grim trees, which
seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees, and to
have blown less in the sun ! At one we dined, Mr. Me11 and I, at the
upper end of a long bare dining-room, full of deal tables, and smelling of
fat. Then, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Me11 drank out
of a blue teacup, and I out of a tin pot. All day long, and until seven
or eight in the evening, Mr. Mell, at his own detached desk in the
schoolroom, worked hard with pen, ink, ruler, books, and writing-paper,
making out the bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put
up his things for the night he took out his flute, and blew at it,
until I almost thought he would gradually blow his whole being into
the large hole at the top, and ooze away at the keys.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    I picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting with my
head upon my hand, listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and
conning to-morrow's lessons. I picture myself with my books shut up,
still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening through
i t to what used to be at home, and to the blowing of the wind on
Yarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary. I picture myself
going u p to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side
crying for a comfortable word from Peggotty. I picture myself coming
down stairs in the morning, and looking through a long ghastly gash
of a staircase-window, at the school-bell hanging on the top of an
outhouse, with a weathercock above it ; and dreading the time when it
shall ring J. Steerforth and the rest to work : which is only second, in my
foreboding apprehensions, to the time when the man with the wooden leg
shall unlock the rusty gate to give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle.
I cannot think I was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects,
but in all of them I carried the same warning on my back.
    Mr. Me11 never said much to me, but he was never harsh to me. I
suppose we were company to each other, without talking. I forgot to
mention that he would talk to himself sometimes, and grin, and clench his
fist, and grind his teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner.
But he had these peculiarities : and at first they frightened me, though I
soon got used to them.




                             CHAPTER TI.
              I ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE.

   I HAD led this life about a month, when the man with the wooden leg
began to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water, from which I
inferred that preparations were making to receive Mr. Creakle and the
boys. I was not mistaken; for the mop came into the schoolroom before
long, and turned out Mr. Me11 and me, who lived where we could, and
got on how we could, for some days, during which we were always in
the way of two or three young women, who had rarely shown themselves
before, and were so continually in the midst of dust that I sneezed almost
as much as if Salem House had been a great snuff-box.
   One day I was informed by Mr. Mell, that Mr. Creakle would be home
that evening. I n the evening, after tea, I heard that he was come. Before
bed-time, I was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear
before him.
   Mr. Creakle's part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than
ours, and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant after the dusty
playground, which was such a desert in miniature, that I thought no one
but a camel, or a dromedary, could have felt at home in it. I t seemed to
me a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked comfortable,
as I went on my way, trembling, to Mr. Creakle's presence : which so
60            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERLENCE

abashed me, when I was ushered into it, that I hardly saw Mrs. Creakle
or Miss Creakle (who were both there, in the parlor), or anything but
Mr. Creakle, a stout gentleman with a bunch of watch-chain and seals, in
an arm-chair, with a tumbler and bottle beside him.
   "So ! " said Mr. Creakle. " This is the young gentleman whose teeth
are to be filed ! Turn him round."
   The wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard ;
and haying afforded time for a full survey of it, turned me about again,
with my face to Mr. Creakle, and posted himself at Mr. Creakle's side.
Mr. Creakle's face was fiery, and his eyes were small, and deep in his
head; he had thick veins in his forehead, a little nose, and a large chin.
H e was bald on the top of his head ; and had some thin wet-looking hair
that was just turning grey, brushed across each temple, so that the two
sides interlaced on his forehead. But the circumstance about him which
impressed me most, was, that he had no voice, but spoke in a whisper.
The exertion this cost him, or the consciousness of talking in that feeble
way, made his angry face so much more angry, and his thick veins so
much thicker, when he spoke, that I am not surprised, on looking back,
at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one.
   " Now, " said Mr. Creakle. " What's the report of this boy ? "
   " There's nothing against him yet, " returned the man with the wooden

leg. " There has been no opportunity. "
   I thought Mr. Creakle was disappointed. I thought Mrs. and Miss
Creakle (at whom I now glanced for the first time, and who were, both,
thin and quiet) were not disappointed.
   " Come here, sir ! " said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me.

   " Come here ! " said the man with the wooden leg, repeating the
gesture.
   "I have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law," whispered
Mr. Creakle, taking me by the ear; " and a worthy man he is, and a
man of a strong character. He knows me, and I know him. Do you
know me ? Hey ? " said Mr. Creakle, pinching my ear with ferocious
playfulness.
   "Not yet, sir," I said, flinching with the pain.
   "Not yet ? Hey? " repeated Mr. Creakle. "But you will soon. Hey ? "
   " You will soon.     Hey ? " repeated the man with the wooden leg. I
afterwards found that he generally acted, with his strong voice, as
Mr. Creakle's interpreter to the boys.
   I was very much frightened, and said, I hoped so, if he pleased. I felt,
all this while, as if my ear were blazing ; he pinched it so hard.
   " I'll tell you what I am," whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it go at last,
with a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes. "I 'm a
Tartar."
   " A Tartar," said the man with the wooden leg.
   " When I say I'll do a thing, I do it," said Mr. Creakle ; '< and when
I say I will have a thing done, I will have it done."
   "-Will have a thing done, I will have it done," repeated the man
with the wooden leg.
   " I am a determined character," said Mr. Creakle. " That 's what I
 am. I do my duty. That's what I do My flesh and blood "-he
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

looked at Mrs. Creakle as he said this-" when it rises against me, is not
my flesh and blood. I discard it. Has that fellow," to the man with
the wooden leg, " been here again ? "
    " No," was the answer.
   " No," said Mr. Creakle. " H e knows better. He knows me. Let
him keep away. I say let him keep away," said Mr. Creakle, striking his
hand upon the table, and looking at Mrs. Creakle, "for he knows me.
Now you have begun to know me too, my young friend, and you may go.
Take him away."
   I was very glad to be ordered away, for Mrs. and Miss Creakle were
both wiping their eyes, and I felt as uncomfortable for them, as I did
for myself. But I had a petition on my mind which concerned me so
nearly, that I couldn 't help saying, though I wondered at my own courage :
   " If you please, sir-"
   Mr. Creakle whispered, " Hah ? What's this ? " and bent his eyes
upon me, as if he would have burnt me up with them.
   " If you please, sir," I faltered, "if I might be allowed (I am very

sorry indeed, sir, for what I did) to take this writing off, before the boys
come back-"
   Whether Mr Creakle was in earnest, or whether he only did it to
frighten me I don't know, but he made a burst out of his chair, before
which I precipitately retreated, without waiting for the escort of the
man with the wooden leg, and never once stopped until I reached
my own bedroom, where, finding I was not pursued, I went to bed, as
it was time, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours.
   Next morning Mr. Sharp came back. Mr. Sharp was the first master,
and superior to Mr. Mell. Mr. Me11 took his meals with the boys, hut
Mr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle's table. He was a limp,
delicate-looking gentleman, I thought, with a good deal of nose, and a way
of carrying his head on one side, as if it were a little too heavy for
him. His hair was very smooth and wavy; but I was informed by the
very first boy who came back that it was a wig (a second-hand one he
said), and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it
curled.
   I t was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of
intelligence. He was the first boy who returned. He introduced himself
by informing me that I should find his name on the right-hand corner of
the gate, over the top bolt ; upon that I said, " Traddles ? " to which
he replied, "The same," and then he asked me for a full account of myself
and &mily.
   I t was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. H e
enjoyed my placard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment of
either disclosure or concealment, by presenting me to every other boy who
came back, great or smal1,immediatelyon his arriva1,in this form of introduc-
tion, "Look here ! Here's a game ! " Happily, too, the greater part of the
boys came back low-spirited, and were not so boisterous at my expense as
I had expected. Some of them certainly did dance about me like wild
Indians, and the greater part could not resist the temptation of pretending
that I was a dog, and patting and smoothing me lest I should bite, and
saying, "Lie down, sir !" and calling me Towzer. This was naturally
62            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

confusing, among so many strangers, and cost me some tears, but on the
whole it was much better than I had anticipated.
   I was not considered as being formally received into the school, however,
until J. Steerforth arrived. Before this boy, who was reputed to be a
great scholar, and was very good-looking, and at least half-a-dozen years
my senior, I was carried as before a magistrate. H e enquired, under a shed
in the playground, into the particulars of my punishment, and was pleased
to express his opinion that it was " a jolly shame ;" for which I became
bound to him ever afterwards.
   "What money have you got, Copperfield? " he said, walking aside with
me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms.
   I told him seven shillings.
   " You had better give it to me to take care of," he said. "At least,
you can if you like. You needn't if you don't like."
   I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and open in^
Peggotty's purse, turned it upside down into his hand.
   " Do you want to spend anything now? " he asked me.

   " No, thank you," I replied.
   " You can if you like, you know," said Steerforth. " Say the word."
   "No, thank you, sir," I repeated.
   " Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of
currant wine by-and-by, up in the bedroom? " said Steerforth. " You
belong to my bedroom, I find."
   It certainly had not occurred to me before, but I said, Yes, I should
like that.
   "Very good," said Steerforth. " You'll be glad to spend another
shilling or so, in almond cakes, I dare say? "
   1 said, Yes, I should like that, too.
   " And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh? "

said Steerforth. " I say, young Copperfield, you 're going it ! "
   I smiled because he smiled, but I was a little troubled in my mind, too.
   " Well ! " said Steerforth.   " We must make it stretch as far as we
can; that's all. I 'll do the best in my power for you. I can go out
when I like, and I'll smuggle the prog in." With these words he put the
money in his pocket, and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy; he
would take care it should be all right.
   H e was as good as his word, if that were all right which I had a secret
misgiving was nearly all wrong-for I feared it was a waste of my mother's
two half-crowns-though      I had preserved the piece of paper they were
wrapped in: which was a precious saving. When we went up-stairs
to bed, he produced the whole seven shillings' worth, and laid it out on
my bed in the moonlight, saying :
   "There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal spread you 'ye got ! "
   I couldn't think of doing the honors of the feast, at my time of life,
while he was by; my hand shook at the very thought of it. I begged
him to do me the favor of presiding; and my request being seconded by
the other boys who were in that room, he acceded to it, and sat upon my
pillow, handing round the viands-with perfect fairness, I must say-and
dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was his
 own property. As to me, I sat on his left hand, and the rest were grouped
 about us, on the nearest beds and on the floor.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    How .well I recollect our sitting there, talking in whispers ; or their
talking, and my respectfully listening, I ought rather to say; the moon-
light falling a little way into the room, through the window, painting a
pale window on the floor, and the greater part of us in shadow, except
when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorous-box, when he wanted
to look for anything on the board, and shed a blue glare over us that was
gone directly ! A certain mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness,
the secresy of the revel, and the whisper in which everything was said,
steals over me again, and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling
of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that they are all so near, and
frightens me (though I feign to laugh) when Traddles pretends to see
a ghost in the corner.
    I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it. I
heard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar
without reason; that he was the-sternest and most severe of masters;
that he laid about him, right and left, every day of his life, charging in
among the boys like a trooper, and slashing away, unmercifully. That he
knew nothing himself, but the art of slashing, being more ignorant (J.
 Steerforth said) than the lowest boy in the school; that he had been,
a good many years ago, a small hop-dealer in the Borough, and had taken
to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops, and making away
with Mrs. Creakle's money. With a good deal more of that sort, which
I wondered how they knew.
    I heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay,
was an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business,
but had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence,
as was supposed among the boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr.
Creakle's service, and having done a deal of dishonest work for him, and
knowing his secrets. I heard that with the single exception of Mr.
 Creakle, Tungay considered the whole establishment, masters and boys,
as his natural enemies, and that the only delight of his life was to be sour
and malicious. I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son, who had not been
Tungay's friend, and who, assisting in the school, had once held some
remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very
cruelly exercised, and was supposed, besides, to have protested against
his father's usage of his mother. I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned
him out of doors, in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had
been in a sad way, ever since.
    But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being
 one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that
boy being J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was
 stated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it. On being
 asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed if he did begin to see
 him do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorous-box on purpose to sheda
glare over his reply, and said he would commence by knocking him down
with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that was
always on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark for some time, breathless.
    I heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Me11 were both supposed to be
wretchedly paid; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at
Mr. Creakle's table, Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred
64            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

cold; which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the only parlor-
boarder. I heard that Mr. Sharp's wig didn't fit him; and that he
needn't be so " bounceable"-somebody else said " bumptious "-about it,
because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind.
   I heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant's son, came as a set-off
against the coal-bill, and was called on that account "Exchange or
Barter "-a      name selected from the arithmetic-book as expressing this
arrangement. I heard that the table-beer was a robbery of parents, and
the pudding an imposition. I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the
school in general as being in love with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I sat
in the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine face, and his easy
manner, and his curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard that
Mr. Me11 was not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to bless
himself with ; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his mother,
was as poor as Job. I thought of my breakfast then, and what had
sounded like "My Charley ! " but I was, I am glad to remember, as mute
as a mouse about it.
   The hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the banquet
some time. The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as
the eating and drinking were over; and we, who had remained whisper-
ing and listening half undressed, at last betook ourselves to bed, too.
   " Good night, young Copperfield," said Steerforth, "I'll take care
of you."
   "You 're very kind," I gratefully returned. " I am very much obliged
to you."
   "You haven't got a sister, have you? " said Steerforth, yawning.
   " NO," I answered.
   " That's a pity," said Steerforth. "If you had had one, I should
think she would have been a pretty, timid, little, bright-eyed sort of girl.
I should have liked to know her. Good night, young Copperfield."
   " Good night, sir," I replied.
   I thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, I
recollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with his handsome
face turned up, and his head reclining easily on his arm. He was a
person of great power in my eyes ; that was of course the reason of my
mind running on him. No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the
moonbeams. There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps, in the
garden that I dreamed of walking in all night.

          TO THE CONCLUDING VOLUME OF THE SERIES, ENTITLED
                RAMBLES BY RIVERS : THE THAMES," VOL. 11.



THISSeries was commenced in June, 1844. I t has been continued, first in
Weekly Volumes, and subsequently in Monthly Volumes, for five years. The
Series is now terminated with the publication of the 186th volume.
  The Series divides itself into three distinct portions :-
           The Weekly and Monthly Volulnes - - - -              - -
           The cabinet Portrait ~ a l l e of

   I n the original announcement of this work I thus stated the objects which IL
would endeavour to attain :-
   " W e propose to place within the reach of all readers a series of books
which shall ultimately comprehend something like that range of literature
which well-educated persons desire to have a t their command. I n this series
there will be no attempt a t exclusiveness. W e shall not take up the most
false and dangerous opinion that the understandings of the masses should be
written down to, nor will mere didactic instruction only be attempted. A
taste for knowledge is not so induced. The recreation of genial and amusing
reading should be offered in connexion with what is solid and serious. The
publishers possess many valuable copyrights which may be readily adapted to
this purpose. There is a great deal also to be done anew, in the way of
judicious compilations, of translations from foreign works, and of original
productions by authors of ability, conceived in a right spirit. W e have many
offers of assistance from writers of established reputation, who feel that the
circulation of their thoughts in a cheap pocket volume is a tribute to their
usefulness and their reputation. W e have no want of materials to conduct
this undertaking steadily and extensively."
   I now venture to believe that I have accomplished what I proposed to do.
   First,-I have endeavoured to produce a series of books which comprehends
something like that range of literature which well-educated persons desire to
have at their command. Without attempting any very exact classification of
                                                                      B
               COMPLETION OF KNIGHT'S SHILLING VOLUMES.

the various subjects of these volumes, they may be thus distributed into large
departments of knowledge :-

   Secondly,-The very nature of the subjects thus comprised in this series
will show that mere didactic instruction has not been attempted; and that
genial and amusing reading is presented in connexion with the solid and
serious. I t would be contrary to the principles upon which I have always
regarded the duties of those who labour in the great cause of making good
literature cheap, if I had in this series presumed it necessary to write down
to the understandings of the masses. I shall never cease to believe that
whatever is best and most permanent in literature has a character of univer-
sality ; and that whenever attempts are made to " write down " to a class, or
" write up " to a class, the thing so produced is worthy of small regard, and

has little influence in its own day, and less upon the future.
    Lastly,-In    stating that I should introduce valuable copyrights into this
Series, and that I had offers of assistance from writers of established repu-
tation, it may be sufficient to point to the names of the various authors" of
these volumes, all of which are original, to show that I have fulfilled this
portion of my undertaking.
   The property of this large Series passed out of my hands as its publisher in
the beginning of 1847, in consequence of business arrangements connected
with a dissolution of partnership. Since then the additions to the Series have
been, for the most part, reprints of copyright works, which were formerly
published by me. I have never ceased to consider myself responsible for the
general character of the work, although my editorial labours had terminated
when about two-thirds of the Series were completed. I may truly add, that
my desire for the constant and increasing circulation of these Volumes con-
tinues unabated ; for I may venture to hope that each and all have a tendency
to carry forward that intellectual progress upon which the future destiny of
this country so essentially depends. And I may confidently state that in this
extensive series no single work, and no portion of a work, can be found, that
may not safely be put into the hands of the young and the uninformed, with
the security that it will neither mislead nor corrupt.

                   By JOHN F. SOUTH, Surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital.
  T h e object of this Work is to afford some useful hints as to the means which
people have in their own power to employ when accidents happen which require
immediate attention and no medical man is at hand, and often cannot be obtained
for hours. Such cases are neither few nor unimportant, and many serious conse-
quences-nay, even death-may be prevented if a judicious person, having been put
on the track, make use of the simple remedies almost every house affords.
   " W e have seldom seen a book of wider or more sound practical utility than
this unpretending little volume. W e can conscientiously recommend Mr. South's
Manual to the notice of the public. I t is not a class-hook; IT IS EVERYBODY'S
BOOK ; and above all, travellers, emigrants, and residents in remote country places
should not fail to provide themselves with it."-Morning   Clwonicle.

   CAUTION.-E MOSES & S O N regret having to guard the public against imposition, but having heard
that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or it is the same concern, has been
resorted to in many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no cnnnexion withany
other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 36, Fargate, Sheffield, and 19,
Thornton's Buildings, Bradford, Yorkshire ; and those who desire genuine and cheap Clothing, &c., should
call at or send to Minories and Aldgate, City, London ;or to the Branch Establishments as above.

resumed till 12 o'clock.
       BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NIUOLL), there is
     another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
     name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
     wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
     be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUlNEAS.




       .--
          The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                              Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
    T H E REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Spring Months, with all
 the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two
 GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,
 but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the
 intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,
 within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,
 with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be seen, ready for
 immediate wear, in every size, at the Patentees' Warerooms.

T   HE peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
    FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers: these Mattresses are made of the
finest materials, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,

  GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
   These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
         T H E EIDER D O W N QUILT,
also, is to be seen only at their House. I t is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed; the Couch, or the
Carriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                      BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, WITH PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensiveproperties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable.
   OLD FEATHER-BEDS re-dressed by this process are perfectly freed from all
impurities ; and, by expanding the Feathers, the bulk is greatly increased, and the
Bed consequently rendered much fuller and softer, at 3d. per lb.
  OLD AND MOTBY MATTRESSES effectually cured and re-made.

  Messrs.MORISON have just received the following Notarial Attestation, under seal from N. H. Martin,
Esq., Notary Public of Cape Breton :-
                                                            Richmond County, Cape Breton, March 12, 1849.
                                T o JOHN
                                       M'KINNON,Esq., Hygeian Agent.
   DEARSIR,-The extraordinary cures which have been reported to me by several persons who laboured
under a variety of complaints, now convalescent through the benefits derived from the Pills sold by your
agents in this district, known as Morisou's Pills, deserve the widest publicity, and I should be wanting in
common gratitude to the discoverer of this valuable medicine, did I for one moment hesitate to advance my
opinion that its effects have saved many from a premature grave, particularly in this portion of Cape Breton.
Being a sceptic for years as to the wonderful cures which I read and heard of,and I must confess too prone
to ridicule the Pills as the production of quackery, I think it but fair to acknowledge my error, and manly
on my part to offer this apology to you as the agent for that incomparable medicine. I deeply regret that
of late a scarcity of the Pllls is felt in the south-eastern section of this island, owing, I understand, to the
treatment you have received from those agents whom you trusted, and who have, to a large amount, been
defaulters. I am requested by a large and influential body of people, personally known to me, to request
you will not visit the sins of a few on a grateful population, by keeping back your usual supply, and that
you will appoint Mr.Morris Kavanah, of Saint Peter's in this county, your future agent, in whose well-
known character and influence the greatest confidence may be placed. Perhaps I may be thought presump-
tuous in taking this liberty with you, but I have been requested to do so; indeed, I was solicited to open a
communication direct with the proprietors, but my other avocations are fully more than I can well attend
to, and have thus expressed to you the wishes of a very large portion of this island's population-say at least
ten thousand persons-leaving to your own judgment the course best to pursue. I am in possession of
numerous vouchers as to cures performed by the Pills, but really my time will not permit me to forward
 them to you, and our rate of postage is too high to send them in their present bulky form.

                I have the honour to remain, Sir,
                                 Your obedient servant,
                                            N. H. MARTIN,
                            Justice of the Peace and Notary Public.
   P.S. Fearing from very slight acquaintance with you, that you may                    BRETON.

                             CHAPTER VII.
                  MY "FIRST     HALF"   AT SALEM HOUSE.

    SCHOOL    began in earnest next day. A profound impression was made
 upon me, I remember, by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly
 becoming hushed as death when Mr. Creakle entered after breakfast, and
 stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a story-book
 surveying his captives.
    Tungay stood at Mr. Creakle's elbow. He had no occasion, I thought,
 to cry out " Silence ! " so ferociously, for the boys were all struck speech-
 less and motionless.
    Mr. Creakle was seen to speak, and Tungay was heard, to this effect.
    "Now, boys, this is a new half. Take care what you're about, in this
 new half. Come fresh up to the lessons, I advise you, for I come fresh up
 to the punishment. I won't flinch. I t will be of no use your rubbing
 yourselves; you won't rub the marks out that I shall give you. Now
 get to work, every boy ! "
    When this dreadful exordium was over, and Tungay had stumped out
 again, Mr. Creakle came to where I sat, and told me that if I were famous
for biting, he was famous for biting, too. He then showed me the cane,
and asked me what I thought of that, for a tooth? Was it a sharp tooth,
Fey ? Was it a double tooth, hey ? Had it a deep prong, hey ? Did
it bite, hey? Did it bite ? At every question he gave me a fleshy cut
with it that made me writhe; so I was very soon made free of Salem
House (as Steerforth said), and very soon in tears also.
   Not that I mean to say these were special marks of distinction, which
only I received. On the contrary, a large majority of the boys (especially
the smaller ones) were visited with similar instances of notice, as
Mr. Creakle made the round of the schoolroom. Half the establishment
was writhing and crying, before the day's work began ; and how much of it
had writhed and cried before the day's work was over, I am really afraid
to recollect, lest I should seem to exaggerate.
   I should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his pro-
fession more than Mr. Creakle did. H e had a delight in cutting at the
boys, which was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite. I am confident
that he couldn't resist a chubby boy, especially; that there was a fascina-
tion in such a subject, which made him restless in his mind, until he had
scored and marked him for the day. I was chubby myself, and ought to
know. I am sure when I think of the fellow now, my blood rises against
him with the disinterested indignation I should feel if I could have known
all about him without having ever been in his power ; but it rises hotly,
because I know him to have been an incapable brute, who had no more
right to be possessed of the great trust he held, than to be Lord High
Admiral, or Commander-in-chief : in either of which capacities, it is pro-
bable that he would have done infinitely less mischief.
   Miserable little propitiators of a remorseless Idol, how abject we were
                                                                 F
66            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

to him ! what a launch in life I think it now, on looking back, to be so
mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions !
   Here I sit at the desk again, watching his eye-humbly watching his
eye, as he rules a cyphering-book for another victim whose hands have
just been flattened by that identical ruler, and who is trying to wipe the
sting out with a pocket-handkerchief. I have plenty to do. I don't
watch his eye in idleness, but because I am morbidly attracted to it, in a
dread desire to know what he will do next, and whether it will be my
turn to suffer, or somebody else's. A lane of small boys beyond me, with
the same interest in his eye, watch it too. I think he knows it, though he
pretends he don't. H e makes dreadful mouths as he rules the cyphering-
book; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane, and we all
droop over our books and tremble. A moment afterwards we are again
eyeing him. An unhappy culprit, found guilty of imperfect exercise,
approaches at his command. The culprit falters excuses, and professes a
determination to do better to-morrow. Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he
beats him, and we laugh at it,-miserable little dogs, we laugh, with our
visages as white as ashes, and our hearts sinking into our boots.
   Here I sit at the desk again, on a drowsy summer afternoon. A buzz
and hum go up around me, as if the boys were so many blue-bottles. A cloggy
sensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me (we dined an hour or
two ago), and my head is as heavy as so much lead. I would give the
world to go to sleep. I sit with my eye on Mr. Creakle, blinking at him
like a young owl; when sleep overpowers me for a minute, he still looms
through my slumber, ruling those cyphering-books ; until he softly comes
behind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him, with a red ridge
across my back.
   Here I am in the playground, with my eye still fascinated by him,
though I can't see him. The window at a little distance from which I
know he is having his dinner, stands for him, and I eye that instead. If
he shows his face near it, mine assumes an imploring and submissive
expression. If he looks out through the glass, the boldest boy (Steerforth
excepted) stops in the middle of a shout or yell, and becomes contemplative.
One day, Traddles (the most unfortunate boy in the world) breaks that
window accidentally, with a ball. I shudder at this moment with the
tremendous sensation of seeing it done, and feeling that the ball has
bounded on to Mr. Creakle's sacred head.
   Poor Traddles ! I n a tight sky-blue suit that made his arms and legs
like German sausages, or roly-poly puddings, he was the merriest and
most miserable of all the boys. H e was always being caned-I think he
was caned every day that half-year, except one holiday Monday when he
was only ruler'd on both hands-and was always going to write to his uncle
 about it, and never did. After laying his head on the desk for a little
while, he would cheer up, somehow, begin to laugh again, and draw
 skeletons all over his slate before his eyes were dry. I used at first to
wonder what comfort Traddles found in drawing skeletons ; and for some
time looked upon him as a sort of hermit, who reminded himself by those
 symbols of mortality that caning couldn't last for ever. But I believe he
 only did it because they were easy, and didn't want any features.
   H e was very honorable, Traddles was; and held it as a solemn duty in
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             67
the boys to stand by one another. H e suffered for this on several
occasions; and particularly once, when Steerforth laughed in church, and
the Beadle thought it was Traddles, and took him out. I see him now,
going away in custody, despised by the congregation. He never said who
was the real offender, though he smarted for it next day, and was
imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a whole churchyard-full
of skeletons swarming all over his Latin Dictionary. But he had his
reward. Steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in Traddles, and
we all felt that to be the highest praise. For my part, I could have gone
through a good deal (though I was much less brave than Traddles, and
nothing like so old) to have won such a recompense.
    To see Steerforth walk to church before us, am-in-arm with Miss
 Creakle, was one of the great sights of my life. I didn't think Miss
 Creakle equal to little Em'ly in point of beauty, and I didn't love her
 (I didn't dare) ; but I thought her a young lady of extraordinary attractions,
and in point of gentility not to be surpassed. When Steerforth, in white
trousers, carried her parasol for her, I felt proud to know him; and believed
that she could not choose but adore him with all her heart. Mr. Sharp
 and Mr. Mell were both notable personages in my eyes; but Steerforth
was to them what the sun was to two stars.
    Steerforth continued his protection of me, and proved a very usefid
friend; since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honored with his coun-
tenance. He couldn't-or        at all events, he didn't-defend me from Mr.
 Creakle, who was very severe with me ; but whenever I had been treated
worse than usual, he always told me that I wanted a little of his pluck, and
that he wouldn't have stood it himself; which I felt he intended for encou-
ragement, and considered to be very kind of him. There was one advau-
tage, and only one that I know of, in Mr. Creakle's severity. H e found
my placard in his way, when he came up or down behind the form on
 which I sat, and wanted to make a cut at me in passing; for this reason
it was soon taken off, and I saw it no more.
    An accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between Steerforth
and me, in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction,
though it sometimes led to inconvenience. I t happened on one occasion,
when he was doing me the honor of talking to me in the playground,
that I hazarded the observation that something or somebody-I forget
what now-was like something or somebody in Peregrine Pickle. He
said nothing at the time; but when I was going to bed at night, asked me
if I had got that book.
   I told him no, and explained how it was that I had read it, and all
those other books of which I have made mention.
    "And do you recollect them ?" Steerforth said.
    Oh yes, I replied; I had a good memory, and I believed I recollected
them very well.
    "Then I tell you what, young Copperfield," said Steerforth, "you shall
tell 'em to me. I can't get to sleep very early at night, and I generally
wake rather early in the morning. We '11 go over 'em one after another.
We '11 make some regular Arabian Nights of it."
   I felt extremely flattered by this arrangement, and we commenced carry-
ing it into execution that very evening. What ravages I committed on
                                       F 2
68             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

my favorite authors in the course of my interpretation of them, I am not
in a condition to say, and should be very unwilling to know ; but I had a
profound faith in them, and I had, to the best of my belief, a simple,
 earnest manner of narrating what I did narrate ; and these qualities went
 a long way.
    The drawback was, that I was often sleepy at night, or out of spirits and
indisposed to resume the story ; and then it was rather hard work, and
it must be done ; for to disappoint or displease Steerforth was of course
out of the question. I n the morning, too, when I felt weary and should
have enjoyed another hour's repose very much, it was a tiresome thing to
be roused, like the Sultana Scheherazade, and forced into a long story
before the getting-up bell rang; but Steerforth was resolute ; and as
he explained to me, in return, my sums and exercises, and anything i n
my tasks that was too hard for me, I was no loser by the transaction.
Let me do myself justice, however. I was moved by no interested or
selfish motive, nor was I moved by fear of him. I admired and loved
him, and his approval was return enough. I t was so precious to me that
I look back on these trifles, now, with an aching heart.
    Steerforth was considerate, too ; and showed his consideration, in one
particular instance, in an unflinching manner that was a little tantalising,
I suspect, to poor Traddles and the rest. Peggotty's promised letter-
what a comfortable letter it was !-arrived before " the half" was many
weeks old ; and with it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges, and two bottles
of cowslip wine. This treasure, as in duty bound, I laid at the feet of
Steerforth, and begged him to dispense.
    "Now, I'll tell you what, young Copperfield," said he: "the wine
shall be kept to wet your whistle when you are story-telling."
    I blushed at the idea, and begged him, in my modesty, not to think of
it. But he said he had observed I was sometimes hoarse-a little roopy
was his exact expression-and it should be, every drop, devoted to the
purpose he had mentioned. Accordingly, it was locked up in his box,
and drawn off by himself in a phial, and administered to me through
a piece of quill in the cork, when I was supposed to be in want of a
restorative. Sometimes, to make it a more sovereign specific, he was so
kind as to squeeze orange juice into it, or to stir it up with ginger, or
dissolve a peppermint drop in i t ; and although I cannot assert that the
flavour was improved by these experiments, or that it was exactly the
compound one would have chosen for a stomachic, the last thing at night
and the first thing in the morning, I drank it gratefully and was very
sensible of his attention.
   We seem, to me, to have been months over Peregrine, and months more
over the other stories. The institution never flagged for want of a story,
I am certain; and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter.
Poor Traddles-I never think of that boy but with a strange disposition
to laugh, and with tears in my eyes-was a sort of chorus, in general; and
affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts, and to be
overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character
in the narrative. This rather put me out, very often. I t was a great
jest of his, I recollect, to pretend that he couldn't keep his teeth from
chattering, whenever mention was made of an Alguazil in connexion with
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          69
the adventures of Gil Blas; and I remember, when Gil Blas met the
captain of the robbers in Madrid, this unlucky joker counterfeited such an
ague of terror, that he was overheard by Mr. Creakle, who was prowling
about the passage, and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the
bedroom.
   Whatever I had within me that was romantic and dreamy, was
encouraged by so much story-telling in the dark; and in that respect the
pursuit may not have been very profitable to me. But the being
cherished as a kind of plaything in my room, and the consciousness that
this accomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys, and
attracted a good deal of notice to me though I was the youngest there,
stimulated me to exertion. I n a school carried on by sheer cruelty,
whether it is presided over by a dunce or not, there is not likely to be
much learnt. I believe our boys were, generally, as ignorant a set as
any schoolboys in existence ; they were too much troubled and knocked
about to learn; they could no more do that to advantage, than any one
can do anything to advantage in a life of constant misfortune, torment,
and worry. But my little vanity, and Steerforth's help, urged me on
somehow; and without saving me from much, if anything, in the way
of punishment, made me, for the time I was there, an exception to
the general body, insomuch that I did steadily pick up some crumbs of
knowledge.
    I n this I was much assisted by Mr. Mell, who had a liking for me that
I am grateful to remember. I t always gave me pain to observe that
Steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement, and seldom lost an
occasion of wounding his feelings, or inducing others to do so. This
troubled me the more for a long time, because I had soon told Steerforth,
from whom I could no more keep such a secret, than I could keep a cake
or any other tangible possession, about the two old women Mr. Me11 had
taken me to see; and I was always afraid that Steerforth would let it out,
and twit him with it.
    We little thought any one of us, I dare say, when I ate my breakfast
that first morning, and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacock's
feathers to the sound of the flute, what consequences would come of the
introduction into those alms-houses of my insignificant person. But the
visit had its unforeseen consequences; and of a serious sort, too, in
their way.
    One day when Mr. Creakle kept the house from indisposition, which
 naturally diffused a lively joy through the school, there was a good deal
 of noise in the course of the morning's work. The great relief and
 satisfaction experienced by the boys made them difficult to manage ; and
 though the dreaded Tungay brought his wooden leg in twice or thrice,
 and took notes of the principal offenders' names, no great impression was
 made by it, as they were pretty sure of getting into trouble to-morrow
 do what they would, and thought it wise, no doubt, to enjoy them-
 selves to-day.
    I t was, properly, a half-holiday ; being Saturday. But as the noise in
the playground would have disturbed Mr. Creakle, and the weather was
 not favorable for going out walking, we were ordered into school in the
 afternoon, and set some lighter tasks than usual, which were made for the
70              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 occasion. I t was the day of the week on which Mr. Sharp went out to
 get his wig curled; so Mr. Mell, who always did the drudgery, whatever
 it was, kept school by himself.
    If I could associate the idea of a bull or a bear with any one so mild
 as Mr. Mell, I should think of him, in connexion with that afternoon when
the uproar was at its height, as of one of those animals, baited by a thousand
 dogs. I recall him bending his aching head, supported on his bony
hand, over the book on his desk, and wretchedly endeavouring to get on
with his tiresome work, amidst an uproar that might have made the
Speaker of the House of Commons giddy. Boys started in and out of
their places, playing at puss in the corner with other boys; there were
laughing boys, singing boys, talking boys, dancing boys, howling boys ;
boys shuffled with their feet, boys whirled about him, grinning, making
faces, mimicking him behind his back and before his eyes : mimicking his
poverty, his boots, his coat, his mother, everything belonging to him that
they should have had consideration for.
    " Silence ! " cried Mr. Mell, suddenly rising up, and striking his desk

with the book. "What does this mean! It's impossible to bear it.
It's maddening. How can you do it to me, boys? "
    I t was my book that he struck his desk with; and as I stood beside
him, following his eye as it glanced round the room, I saw the boys all
stop, some suddenly surprised, some half afraid, and some sorry perhaps.
    Steerforth's place was at the bottom of the school, at the opposite end
of the long room. H e was lounging with his back against the wall, and
his hands in his pockets, and looked at Mr. Me11 with his mouth shut up
as if he were whistling, when Mr. Me11 looked at him.
    " Silence, Mr. Steerforth ! " said Mr. Mell.

    " Silence yourself,"  said Steerforth, turning red. " Whom are you
talking to ? "
    " Sit down," said Mr. Mell.
    "Sit down yourself," said Steerforth, " and mind your business."
    There was a titter, and some applause ; but Mr. Me11 was so white, that
silence immediately succeeded ; and one boy, who had darted out behind
him to imitate his mother again, changed his mind, and pretended to want
a pen mended.
    "If you think, Stecrforth," said Mr. Mell, " that I am not acquainted
with the power you can establish over any mind here"-he laid his hand,
without considering what he did (as I supposed), upon my head-" or that
I have not observed you, within a few minutes, urging your juniors on to
every sort of outrage against me, you are mistaken."
    " I don't give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you," said
Steerforth, coolly; " so I'm not mistaken, as it happens."
    " And when you make use of your position of favoritism here, sir,"

pursued Mr. Mell, with his lip trembling very much, " to insult a
gentleman-"
    " A what ?-where is he ?" said Steerforth.
    Here somebody cried out, " Shame, J. Steerforth ! Too bad ! " It was
Traddles ; whom Mr. Me11 instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his
tongue.
    -"   To insult one who is not fortunate in life, sir, and who never gave
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           71
you the least offence, and the many reasons for not insulting whom
you are old enough and wise enough to understand," said Mr. Mell,
with his lip trembling more and more, you commit a mean and base
action. You can sit down or stand up as you please, sir. Copperfield,
go on."
    " Young Copperfield," said Steerforth, coming forward up the room,

"stop a bit. I tell you what, Mr. Mell, once for all. When you take
the liberty of calling me mean or base, or anything of that sort, you are
an impudent beggar. You are always a beggar, you know; but when you
do that, you are an impudent beggar."
    I am not clear whether he was going to strike Mr. Mell, or Mr. Me11 was
going to strike him, or there was any such intention on either side. I
saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into
stone, and found Mr. Creakle in the midst of us, with Tungay at his
side, and Mrs. and Miss Creakle looking in at the door as if they were
frightened. Mr. Mell, with his elbows on his desk and his face in his
hands, sat, for some moments, quite still.
    " Mr. Mell," said Mr. Creakle, shaking him by the arm ; and his whisper
was so audible now, that Tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words ;
" you have not forgotten yourself, I hope? "
    "NO, sir, no," returned the Master, showing his face, and shaking his
head, and rubbing his hands in great agitation. " No, sir. No. I have
remembered myself, I-no, Mr. Creakle, I have not forgotten myself, I-
I have remembered myself, sir. I-I-could         wish you had remembered
me a little sooner, Mr. Creakle. It-it-would       have been more kind, sir,
more just, sir. It would have saved me something, sir."
    Mr. Creakle, looking hard at Mr. Mell, put his hand on TungayJs
shoulder, and got his feet upon the form close by, and sat upon the desk.
After still looking hard at Mr. Me11 from this throne, as he shook his
head, and rubbed his hands, and remained in the same state of agitation,
Mr. Creakle turned to Steerforth, and said :
    "Now, sir, as he don't condescend to tell me, what is this?"
    Steerforth evaded the question for a little while ; looking in scorn and
anger on his opponent, and remaining silent. I could not help thinking
even in that interval, I remember, what a noble fellow he was in appear-
ance, and how homely and plain Mr. Mell looked opposed to him.
    " What did he mean by talking about favorites, then !" said Steerforth
 at length.
    " Pavorites ? " repeated Mr. Creakle, with the veins in his forehead
 swelling quickly. " Who talked about favorites ? "
    " He did, " said Steerforth.

    " And pray, what did you mean by that, sir ? " demanded Mr. Creakle,
 turning angrily on his assistant.
     " I meant, Mr. Creakle," he returned in a low voice, "as I said; that

 no pupil had a right to avail himself of his position of favoritism to
 degrade me."
    " To degrade you ? " said Mr. Creakle.       " My stars ! But give me
leave to ask you, Mr. What's-your-name; " and here Mr. Creakle folded
his arms, cane and all, upon his chest, and made such a knot of his brows
 that his little eyes were hardly visible below them; "whether, when you
72             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

talk about favorites, you showed proper respect to me? To me, sir,"
said Mr. Creakle, darting his head at him suddenly, and drawing it back
again, " the principal of this establishment, and your employer."
   " I t was not judicious, sir, I am willing to admit," said Mr. Mell. " I
should not have done so, if I had been cool."
   Here Steerforth struck in.
   " Then he said I was mean, and then he said I was base, and then I
called him a beggar. If I had been cool, perhaps I shouldn't have called
him a beggar. But I did, and I am ready to take the consequences of it."
   Without considering, perhaps, whether there were any consequences to
be taken, I felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech. I t made an
impression on the boys too, for there was a low stir among them, though
no one spoke a word.
   "I am surprised, Steerforth-although your candor does you honor,"
said Mr. Creakle, "does you honor, certainly-I am surprised, Steerforth,
I must say, that you should attach such an epithet to any person employed
and paid in Salem House, sir."
   Steerforth gave a short laugh.
   " That's not an answer, sir," said Mr. Creakle, " to my remark. 1
expect more than that, from you, Steerforth."
   If Mr. Me11 looked homely, in my eyes, before the handsome boy, it
would be quite impossible to say how homely Mr. Creakle looked.
   "Let him deny it," said Steerforth.
   "Deny that he is a beggar, Steerforth? " cried Mr. Creakle. " Why,
where does he go a begging ? "
   " If he is not a beggar himself, his near relation's one," said Steerforth.
" It's all the same."
   He glanced at me, and Mr. Mell's hand gently patted me upon the
shoulder. I looked up, with a flush upon my face and remorse in my
heart, but Mr. Mell's eyes werefixed on Steerforth. He continued to pat
me kindly on the shoulder, but he looked at him.
   "Since you expect me, Mr. Creakle, to justify myself," said Steerforth,
  and to say what I mean,-what I have to say is, that his mother lives
on charity in an alms-house."
   Mr. Mell still looked at him, and still patted me kindly on the shoulder,
and said to himself, in a whisper, if I heard right : " Yes, I thought so."
   Mr. Creakle turned to his assistant, with a severe frown and labored
politeness.
   "Now, yon hear what this gentleman says, Mr. Mell. Have the good-
ness, if you please, to set him right before the assembled school."
   "He is right, sir, without correction," returned Mr. Mell, in the midst
of a dead silence; " what he has said, is true."
   "Be so good then as declare publicly, will you," said Mr. Creakle,
putting his head on one side, and rolling his eyes round the school,
"whether it ever came to my knowledge until this moment ? "
   " I believe not directly," he returned.
   "Why, you know not," said Mr. Creakle. "Don't you, man? "
   "I apprehend you never supposed my worldly circumstances to be
very good," replied the assistant. " You know what my position is, and
always has been, here."
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             '13
    " I apprehend, if you come to that," said Mr. Creakle, with his veins
swelling again bigger than ever, "that you 've been in a wrong position
altogether, and mistook this for a charity school. Mr. Mell, we 1' 1 part if
you please. The sooner the better."
    "There is no time," answered Mr. Mell, rising, "like the present."
    " Sir, to you ! " said Mr. Creakle.
    "I take my leave of you, Mr. Creakle, and of all of you," said Mr.
 Mell, glancing round the room, and again patting me gently on the
 shoulder. "James Steerforth, the best wish I can leave you is that you
 may come to be ashamed of what you have done to-day. At present I
 would prefer to see you anything rather than a friend, to me, or to any
 one in whom I feel an interest."
    Once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder; and then taking his
 flute and a few books from his desk, and leaving the key in it for his
 successor, he went out of the school, with his property under his arm.
 Mr. Creakle then made a speech, through Tungay, in which he thanked
 Steerforth for asserting (though perhaps too warmly) the independence
 and respectability of Salem House ; and which he wound up by shaking
 hands with Steerforth, while we gave three cheers-I did not quite know
 what for, but I supposed for Steerforth, and so joined in them ardently,
 though I felt miserable. Mr. Creakle then caned Tommy Traddles for
 being discovered in tears, instead of cheers, on account of Mr. Mell's depar-
 ture; and went back to his sofa, or his bed, or wherever he had come
from.
    We were left to ourselves now, and looked very blank, I recollect, on
one another. For myself, I felt so much self-reproach and contrition
for my part in what had happened, that nothing would have enabled me
to keep back my tears but the fear that Steerforth, who often looked at me,
I saw, might think it unfriendly-or, I should rather say, considering our
relative ages, and the feeling with which I regarded him, undutiful-if I
showed the emotion which distressed me. He was very angry with
Traddles, and said he was glad he had caught it.
    Poor Traddles, who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon
the desk, and was relieving himself as usual with a burst of skeletons, said
he didn't care. Mr. Me11 was ill-used.
    "Who has ill-used him, you girl ? " said Steerforth.
    "Why, you have," returned Traddles.
    "What have I done? " said Steerforth.
    "What have you done ? " retorted Traddles. " Hurt his feelings, and
lost him his situation."
    " His feelings ! " repeated Steerforth disdainfully.    " His feelings will
soon get the better of it, I ' l l be bound. His feelings are not like yours,
Miss Traddles. As to his situation-which was a precious one, wasn't
it ?-do you suppose I am not going to write home, and take care that he
gets some money ? Polly ? "
    We thought this intention very noble in Steerforth, whose mother was
a widow, and rich, and would do almost anything, it was said, that he
asked her. We were all extremely glad to see Traddles so put down, and
exalted Steerforth to the skies : especially when he told us, as he con-
descended to do, that what he had done had been done expressly for us, and
7'4           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

for our cause ; and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly
doing it.
    But I must say that when I was going on with a story in the dark that
night, Mr. Mell's old flute seemed more than once to sound mournfully in
my ears; and that when at last Steerforth was tired, and I lay down in
my bed, I fancied it playing so sorrowfully somewhere, that I was quite
wretched.
    I soon forgot him in the contemplation of Steerforth, who, in an easy
amateur way, and without any book (he seemed to me to know everything
by heart), took some of his classes until a new master was found. The
new master came from a grammar-school ; and before he entered on his
duties, dined in the parlor one day to be introduced to Steerforth.
Steerforth approved of him highly, and told us he was a Brick.
Without exactly understanding what learned distinction was meant by
this, I respected him greatly for it, and had no doubt whatever of his
superior knowledge: though he never took the pains with me-not
that I was anybody-that Mr. Me11 had taken.
    There was only one other event in this half-year, out of the daily
school-life, that made an impression on me which still survives. I t sur-
vives for many reasons.
    One afternoon, when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion,
and Mr. Creakle was laying about him dreadfully, Tungay came in, and
 called out in his usual strong way : " Visitors for Copperfield ! "
    A few words were interchanged between him and Mr. Creakle, as,
who the visitors were, and what room they were to be shown into ; and
then I, who had, according to custom, stood up on the announcement
being made, and felt quite faint with astonishment, was told to go by the
back stairs and get a clean frill on, before I repaired to the dining-room.
These orders I obeyed, in such a flutter and hurry of my young spirits as
I had never known before; and when I got to the parlor-door, and the
thought came into my head that it might be my mother-I had only
thought of Mr. or Miss Murdstone until then-I drew back my hand from
the lock, and stopped to have a sob before I went in.
    At first I saw nobody; but feeling a pressure against the door, I looked
 round it, and there, to my amazement, were Mr. Peggotty and Ham,
 ducking at me with their hats, and squeezing one another against the
 wall. I could not help laughing; but it was much more in the pleasure
 of seeing them, than at the appearance they made. We shook hands in
 a very cordial way ; and I laughed and laughed, until I pulled out my
pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes.
    Mr. Peggotty (who never shut his mouth once, I remember, during the
 visit) showed great concern when he saw me do this, and nudged Ham to
 say something.
    " Cheer up, Mas'r Davy boy!" said Ham, in his simpering way.

 "Why, how you have growed!"
    "Am I grown?" I said, drying my eyes. I was not crying at
 anything particular that I know of; but somehow it made me cry to see
 old friends.
     " Growed, Mas'r Davy bo' ?    Ain't he growed !" said Ham.
     " Ain't he growed !" said Mr. Peggotty.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             75
    They made me laugh again by laughing at each other, and then we all
three laughed until I was in danger of crying again.
    "Do you know how mama is, Mr. Peggotty ? " I said. " And how my
dear, dear, old Peggotty is? "
    " Oncommon," said Mr. Peggotty.

    " And little Em'ly, and Mrs. Gummidge? "
    " On-common," said Mr. Peggotty.
    There was a silence. Mr. Peggotty, to relieve it, took two prodigious
lobsters, and an enormous crab, and a large canvas bag of shrimps, out of
his pockets, and piled them up in Ham's arms.
     "You see," said Mr. Peggotty, "knowing as you was partial to a little
relish with your wittles when you was along with us, we took the liberty.
The old Mawther biled 'em, she did. Mrs. Gummidge biled 'em. Yes,"
said Mr. Peggotty slowly, who I thought appeared to stick to the subject
on account of having no other subject ready, "Mrs. Gummidge, I do
 assure you, she biled 'em."
     I expressed my thanks ; and Mr. Peggotty, after looking at Ham, who
 stood smiling sheepishly over the shell-fish, without making any attempt
 to help him, said :
     " We come, you see, the wind and tide making in our favor, in one of
 our Yarmouth lugs to Gravesen'. My sister she wrote to me the name of
 this here place, and wrote to me as if ever I chanced to come to Gravesen',
 I was to come over and enquire for Mas'r Davy and give her dooty, humbly
 wishing him well and reporting of the fam'ly as they was oncommon
 toe-be-sure. Little Em'ly, you see, she '11 write to my sister when I go
 back, as I see you and as you was similarly oncommon, and so we make it
 quite a merry-go-rounder."
     I was obliged to consider a little before I understood what Mr.
 Peggotty meant by this figure, expressive of a complete circle ofintelligence.
 I then thanked him heartily ; and said, with a consciousness of reddening,
 that I supposed Little Em'ly was altered too, since we used to pick up
 shells and pebbles on the beach?
     " She's getting to be a woman, that 's wot she's getting to be," said
 Mr. Peggotty. " Ask him."
     He meant Ham, who beamed with delight and assent over the bag of
  shrimps.
     "Her pretty face ! " said Mr. Peggotty, with his own shining like a
  light.
      " Her learning ! " said Ham.

      "Her writing ! " said Mr. Peggotty. " Why, it's as black as jet ! And
   so large it is, you might see it anywheres."
      I t was perfectly delightful to behold with what enthusiasm Mr.Peggotty
  became inspired when he thought of his little favorite. He stands before
  me again, his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and pride, for
  which I can find no description. His honest eyes fire up, and sparkle,
  as if their depths were stirred by something bright. His broad chest
  heaves with pleasure. His strong loose hands clench themselves, in his
  earnestness ; and he emphasises what he says with aright arm that shows,
  in my pigmy view, like a sledge hammer.
     Ham was quite as earnest as he. I dare say they would have said
76              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

much more about her, if they had not been abashed by the unexpected
 coming in of Steerforth, who, seeing me in a corner speaking with two
strangers, stopped in a song he was singing, and said : " I didn't know
yon were here, young Copperfield ! " (for it was not the usual visiting
room), and crossed by us on his way out.
    I am not sure whether it was in the pride of having such a friend as
Steerforth, or in the desire to explain to him how I came to have such a
friend as Mr. Peggotty, that I called to him as he was going away. But
I said, modestly-Good Heaven, how it all comes back to me this long
time afterwards !-
   "Don't go, Steerforth, if you please. These are two Yarmouth boat-
men-very kind, good people-who are relations of my nurse, and have
come from Gravesend to see me."
   " Aye, aye? " said Steerforth, returning.       " I am glad to see them.
How are you both ? "
   There was an ease in his manner-a gay and light manner it was, but
not swaggering-which I still believe to have borne a kind of enchant-
ment with it. I still believe him, in virtue of this carriage, his animal spirits,
his delightful voice, his handsome face and figure, and, for aught I know, of
some inborn power of attraction besides (which I think a few people
possess), to have carried a spell with him to which it was a natural weak-
ness to yield, and which not many persons could withstand. I could not
but see how pleased they were with him, and how they seemed to open
their hearts to him in a moment.
    "You must let them know at home, if yon please, Mr. Peggotty," I
said, "when that letter is sent, that Mr. Steerforth is very kind to me,
and that I don't know what I should ever do here without him."
    "Nonsense ! " said Steerforth, laughing. " You mustn't tell them
anything of the sort."
    "And if Mr. Steerforth ever comes into Norfolk or Suffolk, Mr. Peg-
gotty," I said, " while I am there, you may depend upon it I shall bring
him to Yarmouth, if he will let me, to see your house. You never saw
such a good house, Steerforth. I t ' s made out of a boat ! "
   "Made out of a boat, is it ? " said Steerforth. " I t 's the right sort
of house for such a thorough-built boatman."
   " SO 'tis, sir, SO 'tis, sir," said Ham, grinning.    "You 're right, young
gen'lm'n. Mas'r Davy boy, gen'lm'n 's right. A thorough-built boatman !
Hor, hor ! That's what he is, too ! "
   Mr. Peggotty was no less pleased than his nephew, though his modesty
forbade him to claim a personal compliment so vociferously.
   "Well, sir," he said, bowing and chuckling, and tucking in the ends of
his neckerchief at his breast, "I thankee, sir, I thankee! I do my
endeavows in my line of life, sir."
   "The best of men can do no more, Mr. Peggotty," said Steerforth.
He had got his name already.
   "I 1' 1 pound it, it 's wot you do yourself, sir," said Mr. Peggotty,
shaking his head, "and wot you do well-right well ! I thankee, sir.
I 'm obleeged to you, sir, for your welcoming manner of me. I 'm rough,
sir, but I 'm ready-least ways, I hope I 'm ready, you understand. My
house ain't much for to see, sir, but it 's hearty at your service if ever you
                        OF DAYID COPPERPIELD.                            77
 should come along with Mas'r Davy to see it. I ' m a reg'lar Dodman, I
 am," said Mr. Peggotty ;by which he meant snail, and this was in allusion
 to his being slow to go, for he had attempted to go after every sentence,
 and had somehow or other come back again; "but I wish you both well,
 and I wish you happy ! "
    Ham echoed this sentiment, and we parted with them in the heartiest
manner. I was almost tempted that evening to tell Steerforth about pretty
little Em'ly, but I was too timid of mentioning her name, and too much
 afraid of his laughing at me. I remember that I thought a good deal,
 and in an uneasy sort of way, about Mr. Peggotty having said that she
was getting on to be a woman; but I decided that was nonsense.
    We transported the shell-fish, or the "relish" as Mr. Peggotty had
modestly called it, up into our room unobserved, and made a great supper
that evening. But Traddles couldn't get happily out of it. He was too
unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else. He was
taken ill in the night-quite prostrate he was-in consequence of Crab;
 and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills, to an extent
 which Demple (whose father was a doctor) said was enough to undermine
 a horse's constitution, received a caning and six chapters of Greek Testa-
 ment for refusing to confess.
    The rest of the half-year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily
 strife and struggle of our lives ; of the waning summer and the changing
 season ;of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed, and the cold,
 cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again ; of the
evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed, and the morn-
ing schoolroom which was nothing but a great shivering-machine ; of the
alternation of boiled beef with roast beef, and boiled mutton with roast
mutton ; of clods of bread-and-butter, dog's-eared lesson-books, cracked
 slates, tear blotted copy-books, canings, rulerings, hair-cuttings, rainy
 Sundays, suet puddings, and a dirty atmosphere of ink surrounding all.
    I well remember though, how the distant idea of the holidays, after
seeming for an immense time to be a stationary speck, began to come
towards us, and to grow and grow. How, from counting months, we
came to weeks, and then to days; and how I then began to be afraid that I
should not be sent for, and, when I learnt from Steerforth that I had been
sent for and was certainly to go home, had dim forebodings that I might
break my leg first. How the breaking-up day changed its place fast, at last,
from the week after next to next week, this week, the day after to-morrow,
to-morrow, to day, to-night-when I was inside the Yarmouth mail, and
going home.
   I had many a broken sleep inside the Yarmouth mail, and many an
incoherent dream of all these things. But when I awoke at intervals,
the ground outside the window was not the playground of Salem House,
and the sound in my ears was not the sound of Mr. Creakle giving it to
Traddles, but the sound of the coachman touching up the horses.
              THE   PERSONAL HISTORY      AND   EXPERIENCE




                           CHAPTER VIII.
        MY HOLIDAYS.      ESPECIALLY ONE HAPPY AFTERNOON.

    WHENwe arrived before day at the inn where the mail stopped, which
was not the inn where my friend the waiter lived, I was shown up to a nice
little bedroom, with DOLPHINpainted on the door. Very cold I was I
know, notwithstanding the hot tea they had given me before a large fire
down-stairs ; and very glad I was to turn into the Dolphin's bed, pull the
Dolphin's blankets round my head, and go to sleep.
    Mr. Barkis the carrier was to call for me in the morning at nine o'clock.
I got up at eight, a little giddy from the shortness of my night's rest, and
was ready for him before the appointed time. H e received me exactly as
if not five minutes had elapsed since we were last together, and I had
only been into the hotel to get change for sixpence, or something of that
sort.
    As soon as I and my box were in the cart, and the carrier seated, the
lazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace.
    "You look very well, Mr. Barkis," I said, thinking he would like to
know it.
    Mr. Barkis rubbed his cheek with his cuff, and then looked at his cuff
 as if he expected to find some of the bloom upon it ; but made no other
 acknowled,pent of the compliment.
    " I gave your message, Mr. Barkis," I said; " I wrote to Peggotty."
    " Ah ! " said Mr. Barkis.
    Mr. Barkis seemed gruff, and answered drily.
    " Wasn't it right, Mr. Barkis ? " I asked, after a little hesitation.

    " Why, no,''   said Mr. Barkis.
    "Not the message ?"
    " The message was right enough, perhaps," said Mr. Barkis ; " but it
 come to an end there."
    Not understanding what he meant, I repeated inquisitively : "Came to
 an end, Mr. Barkis ? "
    " Nothing come of it," he explained, looking at me sideways.          "NO

 answer."
    " There was an answer expected, was there, Mr. Barkis ? " said I,

 opening my eyes. For this was a new light to me.
     " When a man says he 's willin'," said Mr. Barkis, turning his glance
 slowly on me again, "it's as much as to say, that man's a waitin' for a
 answer."
    "Well, Mr. Barkis ? "
    "Well," said Mr. Barkis, carrying his eyes back to his horse's ears ;
 "that man's been a waitin' for a answer ever since."
    " Have you told her so, Mr. Barkis ? "
    "N-no,"      growled Mr. Barkis, reflecting about it. "I ain't got no
 call to go and tell her so. I never said six words to her myself. I ain't
 a goin' to tell her so."
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

  "Would you like me to do it, Mr. Barkis? " said I , doubtfully.
  " You might tell her, if you would," said Mr. Barkis, with another
slow look at me, " that Barkis was a waitin' for a answer. Says you-
what name is it ? "
   " Her name ? "

   " Ah ! " said Mr. Barkis, with a nod of his head.
   " Peggotty."
   c c Chrisen name ? Or nat'ral name ? " said Mr. Barkis.
   " Oh, it's not her ehristian name. Her christian name is Clara."
   " I s it though ! " said Mr. Barkis.

   He seemed to find an immense fund of reflection in this circumstance,
and sat pondering and inwardly whistling for some time.
   "Well ! " he resumed at length. " Says you, ' Peggotty ! Barkis is a
waitin' for a answer.' Says she, perhaps, 'Answer to what? ' Says you,
' To what I told you.' ' What is that ? ' says she. ' Barkis is willin','
says you."
   This extremely artful suggestion, Mr. Barkis accompanied with a nudge
of his elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side. After that, he
slouched over his horse in his usual manner ; and made no other reference
to the subject except, half an hour afterwards, taking a piece of chalk from
his pocket, and writing up, inside the tilt of the cart, " Clara Peggotty "
-apparently as a private memorandum.
   Ah, what a strange feeling it was to be going home when it was not
home, and to find that every object I looked at, reminded me of the happy
old home, which was like a dream I could never dream again ! The days
when my mother and I and Peggotty were all in all to one another, and
there was no one to come between us, rose up before me so sorrowfully
on the road, that I am not sure I was glad to be there-not sure but that
I would rather have remained away, and forgotten it in Steerforth's com-
pany. But there I was; and soon I was at our house, where the bare old
elm trees wrung their many hands in the bleak wintry air, and shreds of
the old rooks' nests drifted away upon the wind.
   The carrier put my box down at the garden gate, and left me. I
walked along the path towards the house, glancing at the windows, and
fearing at every step to see Mr. Murdstone or Miss Murdstone lowering
out of one of them. No face appeared, however ; and being come to the
house, and knowing how to open the door, before dark, without knocking,
I went in with a quiet, timid step.
    God knows how infantine the memory may have been, that was awakened
within me by the sound of my mother's voice in the old parlor, when I
set foot in the hall. She was singing in a low tone. I think T must
have lain in her arms, and heard her singing so to me when I was but a baby.
The strain was new to me, and yet it was so old that it filled my heart
brim-full ; like a friend come back from a long absence.
   I believed, from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother
murmured her song, that she was alone. And I went softly into the room.
She was sitting by the fire, suckling an infant, whose tiny hand she held
against her neck. Her eyes were looking down upon its face, and she sat
singing to it. I was so far right, that she had no other companion.
    I spoke to her, and she started, and cried out. But seeing me, she
80             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

called me her dear Davy, her own boy! and coming half across the room
to meet me, kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me, and laid my
head down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there,
and put its hand up to my lips.
   I wish I had died. I wish I had died then, with that feeling in my
heart ! I should have been more fit for Heaven than I ever have been
since.
   " H e is your brother," said my mother, fondling me. " Davy, my
pretty boy ! My poor child ! " Then she kissed me more and more, and
clasped me round the neck. This she was doing when Peggotty came
running in, and bounced down on the ground beside us, and went mad
about us both for a quarter of an hour.
   I t seemed that I had not been expected so soon, the carrier being much
before his usual time. I t seemed, too, that Mr. and Miss Murdstone had
gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood, and would not return before
night. I had never hoped for this. I had never thought it possible that
we three could be together undisturbed, once more; and I. felt, for the
time, as if the old days were come back.
   We dined together by the fireside. Peggotty was in attendance to wait
upon us, but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us.
I had my own old plate, with a brown view of a man-of-war in full sail
upon it, which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time I had been
away, and would not have had broken, she said, for a hundred pounds. I
had my own old mug with David on it, and my own old little knife and
fork that wouldn't cut.
   While we were at table, I thought it a favorable occasion to tell Peggotty
about Mr. Barkis, who, before I had finished what I had to tell her, began
to laugh, and threw her apron over her face.
   " Peggotty ! " said my mother. " What's the matter? "
   Peggotty only laughed the more, and held her apron tight over her face
when my mother tried to pull it away, and sat as if her head were in a bag.
   "What are you doing, you stupid creature?" said my mother, laughing.
   " Oh, drat the man ! " cried Peggotty. " He wants to marry me."
   " I t would be a very good match for you ; wouldn't i t ? " said my

mother.
   " Oh ! I don't know," said Peggotty. " Don't ask me. I wouldn't
have him if he was made of gold. Nor I wouldn't have anybody."
   "Then, why don't you tell him so, you ridiculous thing?" said my
mother.
   "Tell him so," retorted Peggotty, looking out of her apron. " H e has
never said a word to me about it. H e knows better. If he was to make
so bold as say aword to me, I should slap his face."
   Her own was as red as ever I saw it, or any other face, I think; but she
only covered it again, for a few moments at a time, when she was taken
with a violent fit of laughter ; and after two or three of those attacks, went
on with her dinner.
   I remarked that my mother, though she smiled when Peggotty looked at
her, became more serious and thoughtful. I had seen at first that she was
changed. Her face was very pretty still, but it looked careworn, and too
delicate; and her hand was so thin and white that it seemed to me t o be
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            81
almost transparent. But the change to which I now refer was superadded
to this : it was in her manner, which became anxious and fluttered. At
last she said, putting out her hand, and laying it affectionately on the hand
of her old servant,
   " Peggotty, dear, you are not going to be married ? "
   " Me, ma'am ? " returned Peggotty, staring. " Lord bless you, no !"
   " Not just yet ? " said my mother, tenderly.
   " Never ! " cried Peggotty.
   My mother took her hand, and said :
   " Don't leave me, Peggotty. Stay with me. I t will not be for long,
perhaps. What should I ever do without you !"
   "Me leave you, my precious !" cried Peggotty. "Not for all the
world and his wife. Why, what's put that in your silly little head ? "
-For Peggotty had been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes
like a child.
   But my mother made no answer, except to thank her, and Peggotty
went running on in her own fashion.
   "Me leave you? I think I see myself. Peggotty go away from you?
I should like to catch her at it ! No, no, no," said Peggotty, shaking her
head, and folding her arms ; "not she, my dear. I t isn't that there ain't
some Cats that would be well enough pleased if she did, but they shan't
be pleased. They shall be aggravated. I'll stay with you till I am a
cross cranky old woman. And when I'm too deaf, and too lame, and too
blind, and too mumbly for want of teeth, to be of any use at all, even to be
found fault with, then I shall go to my Davy, and ask him to take me in."
   " And, Peggotty," says I, '[I shall be glad to see you, and 1'11 make
you as welcome as a queen."
   " Bless your dear heart ! " cried Peggotty. " I know you will ! " And
she kissed me beforehand, in grateful acknowledgment of my hospitality.
After that, she covered her head up with her apron again, and had another
laugh about Mr. Barkis. After that, she took the baby out of its little
cradle, and nursed it. After that, she cleared the dinner-table ; after that,
canie in with another cap on, and her work-box, and the yard-measure,
and the bit of wax candle, all just the same as ever.
   We sat round the fire, and talked delightfully. I told them what a hard
master Mr. Creakle was, and they pitied me very much. I told them
what a fine fellow Steerforth was, and what a patron of mine, and Peggotty
said she would walk a score of miles to see him. I took the little baby in
my arms when it was awake, and nursed it lovingly. When it was asleep
 again, I crept close to my mother's side according to my old custom,
 broken now a long time, and sat with my arms embracing her waist, and
my little red cheek on her shoulder, and once more felt her beautiful hair
 drooping over me-like an angel's wing as I used to think, I recollect-
 and was very happy indeed.
   While I sat thus, looking at the fire, and seeing pictures in the red-hot
 coals, I almost believed that I had never been away ; that Mr. and Miss
 Murdstone were such pictures, and would vanish when the fire got low ;
 and that there was nothing real in all that I remembered, save my mother,
 Peggotty, and I.
   Peggotty darned away at a stocking as long as she could see, and then
                                                                G
82            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

sat with it drawn on her left hand like a glove, and her needle in her
right, ready to take another stitch whenever there was a blaze. I cannot
conceive whose stockings they can have been that Peggotty was always
darning, or where such an unfailing supply of stockings in want of
darning can have come from. From my earliest infancy she seems to
have been always employed in that class of needlework, and never by any
chance in any other.
   " I wonder," said Peggotty, who was sometimes seized with a fit of won-

dering on some most unexpected topic, " what's become of Davy's great-
aunt ? "
   " Lor, Peggotty ! " observed my mother, rousing herself from a reverie,

" what nonsense you talk ! "
   "Well, but I really do wonder, ma'am," said Peggotty.
   " What can have put such a person in your head ? " inquired my mother.
"Is there nobody else in the world to come there? "
   " I don't know how i t is," said Peggotty, "unless it 's on account of

being stupid, but my head never can pick and choose its people. They
come and they go, and they don't come and they don't go, just as they like.
I wonder what's become of her ? "
   " How absurd you are, Peggotty," returned my mother. " One would
suppose you wanted a second visit from her."
   " Lord forbid ! " cried Peggotty.

   " Well then, don't talk about such uncomfortable things, there's a good
soul," said my mother. " Miss Betsey is shut up in her cottage by the
sea, no doubt, and will remain there. At all events, she is not likely ever
to trouble us again."
   " No ! " mused Peggotty.      " No, that ain't likely at all.-I wonder, if
she was to die, whether she'd leave Davy anything? "
   " Good gracious me," Peggotty," returned my mother, " what a non-
sensical woman you are ! when you know that she took offence at the poor
dear boy's ever being born at all ! "
   " I suppose she wouldn't be inclined to forgive him now," hinted
Peggotty.
   " Why should she be inclined to forgive him now ? " said my mother,
rather sharply.
   " Now that he's got a brother, I mean," said Peggotty.
   My mother immediately began to cry, and wondered how Peggotty
dared to say such a thing.
   " As if this poor little innocent in its cradle had ever done any harm to
you or anybody else, you jealous thing!" said she. "You had much
better go and marry Mr. Barkis, the carrier. Why don't you? "
   " I should make Miss Murdstone happy, if I was to," said Peggotty.
   "What a bad disposition you have, Peggotty ! " returned my mother.
"You are as jealous of Miss Mwdstone as it is possible for a ridiculous
creature to be. You want to keep the keys yourself, and give out all the
things, I suppose? I shouldn't be surprised if you did. When you know
that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions ! You know
she does, Peggotty-you know it well."
   Peggotty muttered something to the effect of "Bother the best inten-
tions ! " and something else to the effect that there was a little too much
of the best intentions going on.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           83
     " I know what you mean, you cross thing," said my mother.             "I
 understand you, Peggotty, perfectly. You know I do, and I wonder you
 don't color up like fire. But one point at a time. Miss Murdstone is
 the point now, Peggotty, and you sha'n't escape from it. Haven't you
 heard her say, over and over again, that she thinks I am too thoughtless
 and too-a-a-"
     " Pretty," suggested Peggotty.
     "Well," returned my mother, half laughing, "and if she is so silly as to
 say so, can I be blamed for it ? "
     '< No one says you can," said Peggotty.
      " No, I should hope not, indeed ! " returned my mother. " Haven't
  you heard her say, over and over again, that on this account she wishes to
  spare me a great deal of trouble, which she thinks I am not suited for, and
 which I really don't know myself that I am suited for; and isn't she up
 early and late, and going to and fro continually-and doesn't she do all
 sorts of things, and grope into all sorts of places, coal-holes and pantries
 and I don't know where, that can't be very agreeable-and do you mean
 to insinuate that there is not a sort of devotion in that ? "
      " I don't insinuate at all," said Peggotty.
      " You do, Peggotty," returned my mother. " You never do anything
  else, except your work. You are always insinuating. You revel in it.
 And when you talk of &b.Murdstone's good intentions-"
     " I never talked of 'em," said Peggotty.
     " No, Peggotty," returned my mother, " but you insinuated. That's
 what I told you just now. That's the worst of you. You will insinuate.
 I said, at the moment, that I understood you, and you see I did. When
 you talk of Mr. Murdstone's good intentions, and pretend to slight them
 (for I don't believe you really do, in your heart, Peggotty), you must be as
 well convinced as I am how good they are, and how they actuate him in
 everything. If he seems to have been at all stern with a certain person,
 Peggotty-you understand, and so I am sure does Davy, that I am not
 alluding to any body present-it is solely because he is satisfied that it
 is for a certain person's benefit. He naturally loves a certain person, on
my account ;and acts solely for a certain person's good. He is better able
 to judge of it than I am; for I very well know that I am a weak, light,
 girlish creature, and that he is a firm, grave, serious man. And he takes,"
 said my mother, with the tears which were engendered in her affectionate
 nature, stealing down her face, " he takes great pains with me ;and I
 ought to be very thankful to him, and very submissive to him even in my
thoughts ; and when I am not, Peggotty, I worry and condemn myself,
 and feel doubtful of my own heart, and don't know what to do."
     Peggotty sat with her chin on the foot of the stocking, looking silently
at the fire.
     " There, Peggotty,"   said my mother, changing her tone, " don't let us
fall out with one another, for I couldn't bear it. You are my true friend,
I know, if I have any in the world. When I call you a ridiculous
creature, or a vexatious thing, or anything of that sort, Peggotty, I only
mean that you are my true friend, and always have been, ever since the night
when Mr. Copperfield first brought me home here, and you came out to
the gate to meet me."
                                    *2
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   Peggotty was not slow to respond, and ratified the treaty of friendship
by giving me one of her best hugs. I think I had some glimpses of the
real character of this conversation at the time ; but I am sure, now, that
the good creature originated it, and took her part in it, merely that my
mother might comfort herself with the little contradictory summary in
which she had indulged. The design was efficacious ; for I remember that
my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening, and that
Peggotty observed her less.
   When we had had our tea, and the ashes were thrown up, and the
candles snuffed, I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile Book, in
remembrance of old times-she took it out of her pocket : I don't know
whether she had kept it there ever since-and then we talked about Salem
House, which brought me round again to Steerforth, who was my great
subject. We were very happy; and that evening, as the last of its race,
and destined evermore to close that volume of my life, will never pass out
of my memory.
   I t was almost ten o'clock before we heard the sound of wheels. We
all got up then; and my mother said hurriedly that, as it was so late, and
Mr. and Miss Murdstone approved of early hours for young people, per-
haps I had better go to bed. I kissed her, and went up-stairs with my
candle directly, before they came in. I t appeared to my childish fancy, as
I ascended to the bedroom where I had been imprisoned, that they brought
a cold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar feeling
like a feather.
    I felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning, as
I had never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone since the day when I committed
my memorable offence. However, as i t must be done, I went down, after
two or three false starts half-way, and as many runs back on tiptoe to my
 own room, and presented myself in the parlor.
    He was standing before the fire with his back to it, while Miss Murd-
 stone made the tea. He looked at me steadily as I entered, but made no
 sign of recognition whatever.
    I went up to him, after a moment of confusion, and said : " I beg your
pardon, sir. I am very sorry for what I did, and I hope you will
forgive me."
    " I am glad to hear you are sorry, David," he replied.

    The hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten. I could not restrain
my eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it ; but it was not
so red as I turned, when I met that sinister expression in his face.
    "How do you do, ma'am," I said to Miss Murdstone.
    " Ah, dear me ! " sighed Miss Murdstone, giving me the tea-caddy
 scoop instead of her fingers. " How long are the holidays? "
    " A month, ma'am."

    " Counting from when? "
    ''From to-day, ma'am."
    " Oh ! " said Miss Murdstone.       "Then here's one day off."
    She kept a calendar of the holidays in this way, and every morning
 checked a day off in exactly the same manner. She did it gloomily until
 she came to ten, but when she got into two figures she became more
 hopeful, and, as the time advanced, even jocular.
    I t was on this very f i s t day that I had the misfortune to throw her,
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           85
 though she was not subject to such weaknesses in general, into a state of
 violent consternation. I came into the room where she and my mother
 were sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being on my
 mother's lap, I took it very carefully in my arms. Suddenly Miss Murd-
 stone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it.
     " My dear Jane ! " cried my mother.
     " Good heavens, Clara, do you see ? " exclaimed Miss Murdstone.
     " See what, my dear Jane ? " said my mother ;"~vhere?"

     " H e ' s got it! " cried Miss Murdstone. " The boy has got the
baby ! "
     She was limp with horror ;but stiffened herself to make a dart at me,
 and take it out of my arms. Then, she turned faint; and was so very ill,
 that they were obliged to give her cherry-brandy. I was solemnly in-
 terdicted by her, on her recovery, from touching my brother any more
 on any pretence whatever ; and my poor mother, who, I could see, wished
 otherwise, meekly confirmed the interdict, by saying : "No doubt you are
right, my dear Jane."
    On another occasion, when we three were together, this same dear baby
 -it was truly dear to me, for our mother's sake-was the innocent
 occasion of Miss Murdstone's going into a passion. My mother, who
 had been looking at its eyes as it lay upon her lap, said :
    " Davy ! come here ! " and looked at mine.

    I saw Miss Murdstone lay her beads down.
    "I declare," said my mother, gently, " they are exactly alike. I sup-
pose they are mine. I think they are the color of mine. But they are
wonderfully alike."
    "What are you talking about, Clara? " said Miss Murdstone.
    "My dear Jane," faltered my mother, a little abashed by the harsh
tone of this inquiry, " I find that the baby's eyes and Davy's are exactly
alike."
    " Clara ! " said Miss Murdstone, rising angrily, " you are a positive
fool sometimes."
    " My dear Jane," remonstrated my mother.
    "A positive fool," said Miss Murdstone. "Who else could compare
my brother's baby with your boy? They are not at all alike. They are
exactly unlike. They are utterly dissimilar in all respects. I hope they
will ever remain so. I will not sit here, and hear such comparisons made."
With that she stalked out, and made the door bang after her.
    I n short, I was not a favorite with Miss Murdstone. I n short, I was not
a favorite there with anybody, not even with myself; for those who did
like me could not show it, and those who did not, showed it so plainly
that I had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained,
boorish, and dull.
    I felt that I made them as uncomfortable as they made me. If I came
into the room where they were, and they were talking together and my
mother seemed cheerful, an anxious cloud would steal over her face from
the moment of my entrance. If Mr. Murdstone were in his best humor,
I checked him. If Miss Murdstone were in her worst, I intensified it. I
had perception enough to know that my mother was the victim always ;
that she was afraid to speak to me or be kind to me, lest she should
give them some offence by her manner of doing so, and receive a lecture
86             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 afterwards ; that she was not only ceaselessly afraid of her own offending,
 but of my offending, and uneasily watched their looks if I only moved.
 Therefore I resolved to keep myself as much out of their way as I could;
 and many a wintry hour did I hear the church-clock strike, when I was
 sitting in my cheerless bedroom, wrapped in my little great-coat, poring
 over a book.
    I n the evening, sometimes, I went and sat with Peggotty in the kitchen.
 There I was comfortable, and not afraid of being myself. But neither of
these resources was approved of in the parlor. The tormenting humor
which was dominant there stopped them both. I was still held to be
necessary to my poor mother's training, and, as one of her trials, could
not be suffered to absent myself.
    "David," said Mr. Murdstone, one day after dinner when I was going
to leave the room as usual; " I am sorry to observe that you are of a
sullen disposition."
    "As sulky as a bear !" said Miss Murdstone.
    I stood still, and hung my head.
    " Now, David," said Mr. Murdstone, " a sullen obdurate disposition is,
of all tempers, the worst."
    "And the boy's is, of all such dispositions that ever I have seen,"
remarked his sister, " the most confirmed and stubborn. I think, my
dear Clara, even you must observe it ? "
    " I beg your pardon, my dear Jane," said my mother, "but are you
quite sure-I am certain you'll excuse me, my dear Jane-that you
understand Davy ? "
    " I should be somewhat ashamed of myself, Clara," returned Miss
Murdstone, " if I could not understand the boy, or any boy. I don't
profess to be profound; but I do lay claim to common sense."
    "No doubt, my dear Jane," returned my mother, " your understanding
is very vigorous-"
    " Oh dear, no ! Pray don't say that, Clara," interposed Miss Murdstone,

angrily.
    "But I am sure it is," resumed my mother ; "and everybody knows it
is. I profit so much by it myself, in many ways-at least I ought to-
that no one can be more convinced of it than myself; and therefore1
speak with great diffidence, my dear Jane, I assure you."
    " We 1' 1 say I don't understand the boy, Clara," returned Miss Murd-
stone, arranging the little fetters on her wrists. "We'll agree, if you
please, that I don't understand him at all. He is much too deep for
me. But perhaps my brother's penetration may enable him to have some
insight into his character. And I believe my brother was speaking on
the subject when we-not very decently-interrupted him."
    "I think, Clara," said Mr. Murdstone, in a low, grave voice, " that there
may be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than you."
    " Edward," replied my mother, timidly, " you are a far better judge of
all questions than I pretend to be. Both you and Jane are. I only said-"
    " You only said something weak and inconsiderate," he replied. " Try
not to do it again, my dear Clara, and keep a watch upon yourself."
    My mother's lips moved, as if she answered " Yes, my dear Edward,"
but she said nothing aloud.
    " I was sorry, David, I remarked," said Mr. Murdstone, turning his head

and his eyes stiffly towards me, " to observe that you are of a sullen disposi-
tion. This is not a character that I can suffer to develop itself beneath
my eyes without an effort at improvement. You must endeavour, sir,
to change it. We must endeavour to change it for you."
    " I beg your pardon, sir," I faltered.    " I have never meant to be sullen
since I came back."
    "Don't take refuge in a lie, sir ! " he returned so fiercely, that I saw
my mother involuntarily put out her trembling hand as if to interpose
between us. " You have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your
own room. You have kept your own room when you ought to have been
here. You know now, once for all, that I require you to be here, and not
there. Further, that I require you to bring obedience here. You know
me, David. I will have it done."
    Miss Murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle.
    " I will have a respectful, prompt, and ready bearing towards myself,"
he continued, "and towards Jane Murdstone, and towards your mother.
I will not have this room shunned as if it were infected, at the pleasure of
a child. Sit down."
    H e ordered me like a dog, and I obeyed like a dog.
    " One thing more," he said. " I observe that you have an attachment
to low and common company. You are not to associate with servants.
The kitchen will not improve you, in the many respects in which you need
improvement. Of the woman who abets you, I say nothing-since you,
Clara." addressing mv mother in a lower voice. "from old associations
and Ibng-establishued fancies, have a weakness respecting her which is not
yet overcome."
    " A most unaccountable delusion it is ! " cried Miss Murdstone.

    " I only say," he resumed, addressing me, "that I disapprove of your
preferring such company as Mistress Peggotty, and that it is to be
abandoned. Now, David, you understand me, and you know what will
be the consequence if you fail to obey me to the letter."
    I knew well-better perhaps than he thought, as far as my poor mother
was concerned-and I obeyed him to the letter. I retreated to my own
room no more; I took refuge with Peggotty no more ; but sat wearily in
the parlor day after day, looking forward to night, and bedtime.
    What irksome constraint I underwent, sitting in the same attitude hours
upon hours, afraid to move an arm or a leg lest Miss Murdstone should
 complain (as she did on the least pretence) of my restlessness, and afraid
 to move an eye lest it should light on some look of dislike or scrutiny that
 would find new cause for complaint in mine ! What intolerable dulness
 to sit listening to the ticking of the clock ; and watching Miss Murdstone's
 little shiny steel beads as she strung them ; and wondering whether she
 would ever be married, and if so, to what sort of unhappy man; and
 counting the divisions in the moulding on the chimney-piece ; and wan-
 dering away, with my eyes, to the ceiling, among the curls and corkscrews
 in the paper on the wall !
     What walks I took alone, down muddy lanes, in the bad winter weather,
 carrying that parlor, and Mr. and Miss Murdstone in it, everywhere: a
 monstrous load that I was obliged to bear, a daymare that there was no
 possibility of breaking in, a weight that brooded on my wits, and
 blunted them !
88            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    What meals I had in silence and embarrassment, always feeling that
there were a knife and fork too many, and that mine; an appetite too
many, and that mine ; a plate and chair too many, and those mine ; a
 somebody too many, and that I !
   What evenings, when the candles came, and I was expected to employ
myself, but, not daring to read an entertaining book, pored over some
hard-headed, harder-hearted treatise on arithmetic ; when the tables of
weights and measures set themselves to tunes, as Rule Britannia, or Away
with Melancholy; and wouldn't stand still to be learnt, but would go
threading my grandmother's needle through my unfortunate head, in at
one ear and out at the other !
   What yawns and dozes I lapsed into, in spite of all my care ; what starts
I came out of concealed sleeps with; what answers I never got, to little
observations that I rarely made; what a blank space I seemed, which
everybody overlooked, and yet was in everybody's way; what a heavy
relief it was to hear Miss Murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at night,
and order me to bed !
   Thus the holidays lagged away, until the morning came when Miss
Murdstone said : "Here's the last day off! " and gave me the closing cup
of tea of the vacation.
   I was not sorry to go. I had lapsed into a stupid state; but I was
recovering a little and looking forward to Steerforth, albeit Mr. Creakle
loomed behind him. Again Mr. Barkis appeared at the gate, and again
Miss Murdstone in her warning voice said : " Clara ! " when my mother
bent over me, to bid me farewell.
   I kissed her, and my baby brother, and was very sorry then; but not
sorry to go away, for the gulf between us was there, and the parting was
there, every day. And it is not so much the embrace she gave me, that
lives in my mind, though it was as fervent as could be, as what followed
the embrace.
   I was in the carrier's cart when I heard her calling to me. I looked
out, and she stood at the garden-gate alone, holding her baby up in her
arms for me to see. I t was cold still weather; and not a hair of her head,
or a fold of her dress, was stirred, as she looked intently at me, holding up
                                                                        -   -
her child.
   So I lost her. So I saw her afterwards, in my sleep at school-a
silent presence near my bed-looking at me with the same intent face-
holding up her baby in her arms.



                             CHAPTER IX.
                   I HAVE A MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY.

   I PASS over all that happened at school, until the anniversary of my
birthday came round in March. Except that Steerforth was more to be
admired than ever, I remember nothing. H e was going away at the end
of the half-year, if not sooner, and was more spirited and independent than
before in my eyes, and therefore more engaging than before ; but beyond
this I remember nothing. The great remembrance by which that time is
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             89
marked in my mind, seems to have swallowed up all lesser recollections,
and to exist alone.
   I t is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two
months between my return to Salem House and the arrival of that birth-
day. I can only understand that the fact was so, because I know it must
have been so; otherwise I should feel convinced that there was no
interval, and that the one occasion trod upon the other's heels.
   How well I recollect the kind of day it was ! I smell the fog that hung
about the place ; I see the hoar frost, ghostly, through it ; I feel my rimy
hair fall clammy on my cheek; I look along the dim perspective of the
schoolroom, with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the foggy
morning, and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the raw
cold as they blow upon their fingers, and tap their feet upon the floor.
   It was after breakfast, and we had been summoned in from the play-
ground, when Mr. Sharp entered and said :
   "David Copperfield is to go into the parlor."
   I expected a hamper from Peggotty, and brightened at the order. Some
of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the distri-
bution of the good things, as I got out of my seat with great alacrity.
   " Don't hurry, David," said Mr. Sharp. " There 's time enough, my
boy, don't hurry."
   I might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke, if I
had given it a thought ; but I gave it none until afterwards. I hurried
away to the parlor; and there I found Mr. Creakle sitting at his breakfast
with the cane and a newspaper before him, and Mrs. Creakle with an
opened letter in her hand. But no hamper.
   " David Copperfield," said Mrs. Creakle, leading me to a sofa, and sitting
down beside me. " I want to speak to you very particularly. I have
something to tell you, my child."
   Mr. Creakle, at whom of course I looked, shook his head without looking
at me, and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast.
   "You are too young to know how the world changes every day," said
Mrs. Creakle, "and how the people in it pass away. But we all have to
learn it, David; some of us when we are young, some of us when we are
old, some of us at all times of our lives."
   I looked at her earnestly.
   " When you came away from home at the end of the vacation," said
Mrs. Creakle, after a pause, " were they all well ? " After another pause,
" Was your mama well ? "
   I trembled without distinctly knowing why, and still looked at her
earnestly, making no attempt to answer.
   "Because," said she, "I grieve to tell you that I hear this morning
your mama is very ill."
   A mist arose between Mrs. Creakle and me, and her figure seemed to
move in it for an instant. Then I felt the burning tears run down my
face, and it was steady again.
   " She is very dangerously ill," she added.
   I knew all now.
   " She is dead."

   There was no need to tell me so. I had already broken out into a
desolate cry, and felt an orphan in the wide world.
90            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     She was very kind to me. She kept me there all day, and left me
alone sometimes ; and I cried, and wore myself to sleep, and awoke and
 cried again. When I could cry no more, I began to think; and then the
oppression on my breast was heaviest, and my grief a dull pain that there
was no ease for.
    And yet my thoughts were idle ; not intent on the calamity that weighed
upon my heart, but idly loitering near it. I thought of our house shut
up and hushed. I thought of the little baby, who, Mrs. Creakle said, had
been pining away for some time, and who, they believed, would die too.
I thought of my father's grave in the churchyard, by our house, and of
my mother lying there beneath the tree I knew so well. I stood upon
a chair when I was left alone, and looked into the glass to see how red
my eyes were, and how sorrowful my face. I considered, after some hours
were gone, if my tears were really hard to flow now, as they seemed to
be, what, in connexion with my loss, it would affect me most to think of
when I drew near home-for          I was going home to the funeral. I am
sensible of having felt that a dignity attached to me among the rest of
the boys, and that I was important in my affliction.
    If ever child were stricken with sincere grief, I was. But I remember
that this importance was a kind of satisfaction to me, when I walked in
the playground that afternoon while the boys were in school. When I
saw them glancing at me out of the windows, as they went up to their
classes, I felt distinguished, and looked more melancholy, and walked
slower. When school was over, and they came out and spoke to me, I
felt it rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them, and to take
exactly the same notice of them all, as before.
    I was to go home next night; not by the mail, but by the heavy night-
coach, which was called the Parmer, and was principally used by country-
people travelling short intermediate distances upon the road. We had no
story-telling that evening, and Traddles insisted on lending me his pillow.
I don't know what good he thought it would do me, for I had one of my
own : but it was all he had to lend, poor fellow, except a sheet of letter-
paper full of skeletons ; and that he gave me at parting, as a soother of my
sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind.
    I left Salem House upon the morrow afternoon. I little thought then
that I left it, never to return. We travelled very slowly all night, and
did not get into Yarmouth before nine or ten o'clock in the morning.
I looked out for Mr. Barkis, but he was not there; and instead of him a
fat, short-winded, merry-looking, little old man in black, with rusty little
bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches, black stockings, and a
broad-brimmed hat, came puffing up to the coach window, and said :
    "Master Copperfield? "
    "Yes, sir."
    " Will you come with me, young sir, if you please," he said, opening
the door, " and I shall have the pleasure of taking you home."
    I put my hand in his, wondering who he was, and we walked away to
a shop in a narrow street, on which was written OMER,DRAPER,TAILOR,
HABERDASHER,       FUNERALFURNISHER,         &c. I t was a close and stifling
little shop ; full of all sorts of clothing, made and unmade, including one
window full of beaver-hats and bonnets. We went into a little back-
parlor behind the shop, where we found three young women at work on a
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           91
quantity of black materials, which were heaped upon the table, and little
bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor. There was a
good fire in the room, and a breathless smell of warm black crape-I did
not know what the smell was then, but I know now.
   The three young women, who appeared to be very industrious and com-
fortable, raised their heads to look at me, and then went on with their
work. Stitch, stitch, stitch. At the same time there came from a work-
shop across a little yard outside the window, a regular sound of hammering
that kept a kind of tune : Ra~--tat-tat, R~~--tat-tat,R~~--tat-tat,without
any variation.
   " Well ! " said my conductor to one of the three young women. " How
do you get on, Minnie ? "
   " We shall be ready by the trying-on time," she replied gaily, without
looking up. " Don't you be afraid, father."
   Mr. Omer took off his broad-brimmed hat, and sat down and panted.
H e was so fat that he was obliged
                                 - to pant some time before he could sag :
   '' That's right."
   " Father ! " said Minnie, playfully.   " What a porpoise you do grow ! "
   "Well, I don't know how it is, my dear," he replied, considering - about
it. " I am rather so."
   " Yon are such a comfortable man, you see," said Minnie. '(You take
things so easy."
   " No use taking 'em otherwise, my dear," said Mr. Omer.

   " No, indeed," returned his daughter. " %re are all pretty gay here,
thank Heaven ! Ain't we, father ? "
   " I hope so, my dear," said Mr. Omer.       " As I have got my breath
now, I think 1'11 measure this young scholar. Would you walk into the
shop, Master Copperfield ? "
   I preceded Mr. Omer, in compliance with his request; and after showing
me a roll of cloth which he said was extra super, and too good mourning
for anything short of parents, he took my various dimensions, and put
them down in a book. While he was recording them he called my atten-
tion to his stock in trade, and to certain fashions which he said had "just
come up," and to certain other fashions which he said had "just gone out."
   " And by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money,"

said Mr. Omer. " But fashions are like human beings. They come in,
nobody knows when, why, or how ; and they go out, nobody knows when,
why, or how. Everything is like life, in my opinion, if you look at it in
that point of view."
   I was too sorrowful to discuss the question, which would possibly have
been beyond me under any circumstances; and Mr. Omer took me back
into the parlor, breathing with some difficulty on the way.
   H e then called down a little break-neck range of steps behind a
door : " Bring up that tea and bread-and-butter ! " which, after some
time, during which I sat looking about me and thinking, and listening
to the stitching in the room and the tune that was being hammered across
the yard, appeared on a tray, and turned out to be for me.
   " I have been acquainted with you," said Mr. Omer, after watching me
for some minntes, during which I had not made much impression on the
breakfast, for the black things destroyed my appetite, " I have been
acquainted with you a long time, my young friend."
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   " Have you, sir ? "
    '< All your life," said Nr. Omer.     " I may say before it.  I knew your
father before you. He was five foot nine and a half, and he lays in five
 and twen-ty foot of ground."
    "RAT-tat-tat, RAT-tat-tat, RAT-tat-tat," across the yard.
    " He lays in five and twen-ty foot of ground, if he lays in a fraction,"
 said Mr. Omer, pleasantly. " I t was either his request or her direction, I
forget which."
    "Do you know how my little brother is, sir ? " I inquired.
    Mr. Omer shook his head.
    " RAT-tat-tat,      RAT-tat-tat, ~~r-tat-tat."
    " He is in his mother's arms," said he.

    " Oh, poor little fellow ! I s he dead? "
    " Don't mind it more than you can help," said Mr. Omer. " Yes.
The baby's dead."
   My wounds broke out afresh at this intelligence. I left the scarcely-
tasted breakfast, and went and rested my head on another table in a corner
of the little room, which Minnie hastily cleared, lest I should spot the
mourning that was lying there with my tears. She was a pretty good-
natured girl, and put my hair away from my eyes with a soft kind touch ;
but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished her work and being in
good time, and was so different from me !
    Presently the tune left off, and a good-looking young fellow came across
 the yard into the room. He had a hammer in his hand, and his mouth was
 full of little nails, which he was obliged to take out before he could speak.
    " Well, Joram! " said Mr. Omer.        '' How do yo%get on? "
    " All right," said Joram. " Done, sir."
    Minnie colored a little, and the other two girls smiled at one another.
    " What ! you were at it by candle-light last night, when I was at the

club, then? Were you? " said Mr. Omer, shutting up one eye.
    "Yes," said Joram. '' As you said we could make a little trip of it,
and go over together, if it was done, Minnie and me-and you."
    " Oh! I thought you were going to leave me out altogether," said Mr.
Omer, laughing till he coughed.
    "-As       you was so good as to say that," resumed the young man,
"why I turned to with a will, you see. Will you give me your opinion
of i t ? "
    " I will," said Mr. Omer, rising. "My dear ;" and he stopped and
turned to me ; "would you like to see your-          "
    "No, father," Minnie interposed.
   "I thought it might be agreeable, my dear," said Mr. Omer. " But
perhaps you 're right."
   I can't say how I knew it was my dear, dear mother's coffin that they went
to look at. I had never heard one making ; I had never seen one that I
know of: but it came into my mind what the noise was, while it was
going on; and when the young man entered, I am sure I knew what he
had been doing.
   The work being now finished, the two girls, whose names I had not
heard, brushed the shreds and threads from their dresses, and went into
the shop to put that to rights, and wait for customers. Minnie stayed
behind to fold up what they had made, and pack it in two baskets. This
                            OF DAVLD COPPERFIELD.                           93
    she did upon her knees, humming a lively little tune the while. Joram,
    who I had no doubt was her lover, came in and stole a kiss from her
    while she was busy (he didn't appear to mind me, at all), and said her
    father was gone for the chaise, and he must make haste and get himself
    ready. Then he went out again; and then she put her thimble and
    scissors in her pocket, and stuck a needle threaded with black thread
    neatly in the bosom of her gown, and put on her outer clothing smartly,
    at a little glass behind the door, in which I saw the reflection of her
    pleased face.
       All this I observed, sitting at the table in the corner with my head
    leaning on my hand, and my thoughts running on very different things.
    The chaise soon came round to the front of the shop, and the baskets
    being put in first, I was put in next, and those three followed. I remember
    it as a kind of half chaise-cart, half piano-forte van, painted of a
    sombre color, and drawn by a black horse with a long tail. There was
    plenty of room for us all.
       I do not think I have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life
    (I am wiser now, perhaps) as that of being with them, remembering how
    they had been employed, and seeing them enjoy the ride. I was not
    angry with them; I was more afraid of them, as if I were cast away among
    creatures with whom I had no community of nature. They were very
    cheerful. The old man sat in front to drive, and the two young people
    sat behind him, and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward, the one
    on one side of his chubby face and the other on the other, and made a
    great deal of him. They would have talked to me too, but I held back,
    and moped in my corner; scared by their love-making and hilarity, though
    it was far from boisterous, and almost wondering that no judgment came
    upon them for their hardness of heart.
       So, when they stopped to bait the horse, and ate and drank and enjoyed
    themselves, I could touch nothing that they touched, but kept my fast
'   unbroken. So, when we reached home, I dropped out of the chaise behind,
    as quickly as possible, that I might not be in their company before those
    solemn windows, looking blindly on me like closed eyes once bright. And
    oh, how little need I had had to think what would move me to tears
    when I came back-seeing the window of my mother's room, and next it
    that which, in the better time, was mine !
       I was in Peggotty's arms before I got to the door, and she took me
    into the house. Her grief burst out when she first saw me; but she
    controuled it soon, and spoke in whispers, and walked softly, as if the
    dead could be disturbed. She had not been in bed, I found, for a long
    time. She sat up at night still, and watched. As long as her poor dear
    pretty was above the ground, she said, she would never desert her.
       Mr. Mnrdstone took no heed of me when I went into the parlor where
    he was, but sat by the fireside, weeping silently, and pondering in his
    elbow-chair. Miss Murdstoue, who was busy at her writing-desk, which
    was covered with letters and papers, gave me her cold finger-nails, and
    asked me, in an iron whisper, if I had been measured for my mourning.
       I said : " Yes."
       "And your shirts," said Miss Murdstone; " have you brought 'em
    home ? "
       "Yes, ma'am. I have brought home all my clothes.'

                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             95
 When we go out to the door, the Bearers and their load are in the
 garden; and they move before us down the path, and past the elms, and
 through the gate, and into the church-yard where I have so often heard
 the birds sing on a summer morning.
    We stand around the grave. The day seems different to me from every
 other day, and the light not of the same color-of a sadder color. Now
there is a solemn hush, which we have brought from home with what is
 resting in the mould; and while we stand bare-headed, I hear the voice of
 the clergyman, sounding remote in the open air, and yet distinct and
 plain, saying : " I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord ! "
 Then I hear sobs; and, standing apart among the lookers-on, I see that
 good and faithful servant, whom of all the people upon earth I love the
best, and unto whom my childish heart is certain that the Lord will one
day say : "Well done."
   There are many faces that I know, among the little crowd; faces that
I knew in church, when mine was always wondering there ; faces that first
saw my mother, when she came to the village in her youthful bloom. I do
not mind them-I mind nothing but my grief-and yet I see and know
them all ; and even in the background, far away, see Minnie looking on,
and her eye glancing on her sweetheart, who is near me.
   I t is over, and the earthis filled in, and we turn to come away. Before
us stands our house, so pretty and unchanged, so linked in my mind with
the young idea of what is gone, that all my sorrow has been nothing to
the sorrow it calls forth. But they take me on; and Mr. Chillip talks to me ;
and when we get home, puts some water to my lips ; and when I ask his
leave to go up to my room, dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman.
   All this, I say, is yesterday's event. Events of later date have floated
from me to the shore where all forgotten things will reappear, but this
stands like a high rock in the ocean.
   I knew that Peggotty would come to me in my room. The Sabbath
stillness of the time (the day was so like Sunday ! I have forgotten that)
was suited to us both. She sat down by my side upon my little bed;
and holding my hand, and sometimes putting it to her lips, and sometimes
smoothing it with hers, as she might have comforted my little brother,
told me, in her way, all that she had to tell concerning what had happened.

   "She was never well," said Peggotty, "for a long time. She was
uncertain in her mind, and not happy. When her baby was born, I
thought at first she would get better, but she was more delicate, and sunk
a little every day. She used to like to sit alone before her baby came, and
then she cried ; but afterwards she used to sing to it-so soft, that I once
thought, when I heard her, it was like a voice up in the air, that was rising
away.
   " I think she got to be more timid, and more frightened-like, of late ; and
that a hard word was like a blow to her. But she was always the same to
me. She never changed to her foolish Peggotty, didn't my sweet girl."
   Here Peggotty stopped, and softly beat upon my hand a little while.
   " The last time that I saw her like her own old self, was the night when
you came home, my dear. The day you went away, she said to me, ' I
never shall see my pretty darling again. Something tells me so, that tells
the truth, I know.'
96            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   "She tried to hold up after that ; and many a time, when they told her
she was thoughtless and light-hearted, made believe to be so ; but it was
all a bygone then. She never told her husband what she had told me-
she was afraid of saying it to anybody else-till one night, a little more
than a week before it happened, when she said to him : ' My dear, I think
I am dying.'
   " ' It's off my mind now, Peggotty,' she told me, when I laid her in her
bed that night. ' I-Ie will believe it more and more, poor fellow, every day
for a few days to come ; and then it will be past. I am very tired. If this
is sleep, sit by me while I sleep : don't leave me. God bless both my
children ! God protect and keep my fatherless boy ! '
   "I never left her afterwards," said Peggotty. "She often talked to
them two down stairs-for she loved them ; she couldn't bear not to love
any one who was about her-but when they went away from her bedside,
she always turned to me, as if there was rest where Peggotty was, and
never fell asleep in any other way.
   " On the last night, in the evening, she kissed me, and said : ' If my

baby should die too, Peggotty, please let them lay him in my arms, and
bury us together.' (It was done ;for the poor lamb lived but a day beyond
her.) ' Let my dearest boy go with us to our resting-place,' she said, 'and
tell him that his mother, when she lay here, blessed him not once, but a
thousand times.' "
   Another silence followed this, and another gentle beating on my hand.
   " I t was pretty far in the night," said Peggotty, " when she asked me

for some drink ; and when she had taken it, gave me such a patient smile,
the dear !-so beautiful !-
   "Daybreak had come, and the sun was rising, when she said to me,
how kind and considerate Mr. Copperfield had always been to her, and how
he had borne with her, and told her, when she doubted herself, that a
loving heart was better and stronger than wisdom, and that he was a
happy man in hers. ' Peggotty, my dear,' she said then, 'put me nearer
to you,' for she was very weak. ' Lay your good arm underneath my neck,'
she said, ' and turn me to you, for your face is going far off, and I want it
to be near.' I put it as she asked; and oh Davy! the time had come
when my first parting words to you were true-when she was glad to
lay her poor head on her stupid cross old Peggotty's arm-and she died
like a child that had gone to sleep ! "
   Thus ended Peggotty's narration. From the moment of my knowing
of the death of my mother, the idea of her as she had been of late had
vanished from me. I remembered her, from that instant, only as the young
mother of my earliest impressions, who had been used to wind her bright
curls round and round her finger, and to dance with me at twilight in the
parlor. What Peggotty had told me now, was so far from bringing me back
to the later period, that it rooted the earlier image in my mind. I t may
be curious, but it is true. I n her death she winged her way back to her
calm untroubled youth, and cancelled all the rest.
    The mother who lay in the grave, was the mother of my infancy ; the
little creature in her arms, was myself, as I had once been, hushed for ever
on her bosom.

                                                     THE PATENT

CORK FLOATING MATTRESS & BOAT CUSHION,
                                                                FOR

                  THE PRESERVATION OF LIFE ON THE WATER.

      THE FLOATING QUALITY,or buoyancy, of CORKis known by every body : it is needless to speak about it in
a Circular. The application of that quality in an available form at sea has never yet been achieved, and several
years of the Patentee's life have been spent in seeking the successful solution of that problem.
      Mattresses and Bolsters, Sofa-cushions, and Squabs, all articles of indispensable necessity in the cabin,
when stuffed with CORKFIBRE, in lieu of the ordinary material, BECOME LIFE-PRESERVERS in the hour of danger,
while they subserve all their usual purposes a t other times.
      The efficiency of these Life-preservers is indisputable as they form ARTICLES OF DAILY USE,ARE ALWAYS
AT HAND, and ready for service in the event of any cala&ity from accident, shipwreck, or fire, however sudden
that calamity may be, and whether by night or day. Moreover, THEY TAKE NO ADDITIONAL SPACE.
      The Mattresses and bedding do not depend upon a waterproof or any particular covering-nor upon the
exclusion of water-nor upon inflation by air-THE1~ BUOYANCY IS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE IMPAIRED
BY SATURATION, LEAKAGE, PERFORATION, OR DAMAGE OF ANY DESCRIPTION ; in fact, a Mattress torn in several
pieces will still float.
      Steam-boat and Ship-owners Yembers of Yacht Clubs, Passengers, Emigrants, all Innst be interested in
a n invention which laces humaniife beyond the risks incident to the sea.

      The loss of life, which i s constantly occurring on the rivers and lakes of England, from boat accidents, might
be wholly preventpd, by so simpb a n expedient as supplying all Boats afloat wcth Cushions stuffed with this
Cork jibre.
     But the advantages of the Cork Fibre are numerous for general application as: stuffing :-
   1st.-For cleanliness it is unsurpassed, as it affords no support for insect life.
   2nd.-It is a non-conductor of heat, and therefore eminently adapted for Invalids.
   3rd.-It is a non-absorbent. No moisture is retained, but all fluids instantly permeate.
   4th.-For India, and the Tropics generally, it is invaluable. Every one familiar with tropical grievances
        place foremost amongst them the ravages of the Moth and other insects of the like destructive habits.
        Reds, Sofas, Mattresses, Stools, Saddles, Horse-Collars, Carriage-linings-all perish in a comparatively
        short period of time before these devastating vermin. Cork is a natural repellent of insect life, as the
        oils which promote its development and sustenance are absent.
   5th.-Moreover, the best medical authorities agree that Cork possesses properties which are alike preventive
        and curative of certain affections to which the human frame is subject, such as rheumatism, cramp, &c.
        To any one acquainted with the customs peculiar to the Spanish Pen~nsula(the native soil of the Cork
        tree), the medical qualities of this hark are not unknown.
      For a11 these reasons the Patent Cork Fibre is peculiarly adapted for the Mattresses of Barracks, Unions,
Hospitals, Lunatic Asylums, Orphan Schools, and, indeed, for all Institutions where the first requisites are-
health and cleanliness.
      T o officers under canvas in campaign, the Cork Fibre Mattress will he invaluable, as it will preserve
them from the effects of sleeping upon damp bedding, to which they owe so much of their ill-health in
after life.
      The Floating Power of the Mattress in sustaining men in the water is daily exhibited at the Royal
Polytechnic Institution, Regent Street; and at the Company's Works, it may be tried by any applicant In a
bmiu appropriated to it, iilled with tepid water.
      Mattresses, Boat-Cushions, Fmigrants' BolsterB, and all other manufactured articles, may be obtained of
all respectable Upholsterers, Cabinet Makers, and Steam Boat Fitters.
      The Fibre can only be had a t the Company's Works, City Saw-Mills, Wenlock Basin, Regent's Canal,
City Road.
                                                                          T H E O . S H E A T H , SECRETARY.
    CAUTION.-No person should lash himself on to the top of the Mattress i n (he event of Shipwreck,. for,
being the heavier body, the wash of the waves would probably turn h i m underneath, and Vie extraordzna?y
buoyancy of the Cork would prevent h i m from ~ i g h t i n ghimself again.

     CORKMATTRESSESFOR SUIPS.-"A number of experiments were last summer exhibited on the Thames
and in the basin in Woolwich Dockyard, to prove the efficacy of a n invention by which the lives of sailors and
passengers in ships, Bc. could, in the event of shipwreck, he saved. The invention, which was very simple,
consisted in substituting cork cutlings or shreds in the place of horse hair, wool, or flock, as the stuffing for
mattresses, pillovvs, Bc., t o be employed in ships and nautical craft of all kinds. The experiments were perfectly
satisfactory, and were approved of by Sir G. Bremer and by many persons connected with the navy, and by
scientificmen who witnessed them. The cork was cut into small vermicular shreds of various fineness, and a
few pounds of this material were found to possess a most extraordinary buoyant power. The difficulty a t that
time was to procure the article so manufactured in such quantities as to render it generally serviceable; the
instruments emplo ed to cut the shreds, from the toughness of the cork, not possessing sufficient power, or being
sufficiently adapte$ to cut large quantities, except by a very slow process. The consequence was, the invention
did not become very generally known or used. Since that time machinery has been contrived, and is now a t
work o n the premises of the patentees, a t the          Saw Mills, Regent's-canal, by which the cork is cut with
the greatest dispatch and facility, and can be furnished to any extent. The recent lamentable loss of 170 Lives
on the coast of Essez would not have happened had the unfortunate vessel tuhich was wrecked had mattresses of
this materiud on board. The majority ofthe stcrerers mighlprobably have escaped by meansof it."-The Times.

      PRESERVATION      OF LIFE FROM SHIPWRECK.-PATENTCORKSTUFFING.-(' Our colnmns have again recorded
one of those vast losses of human life by the shipwreck of the ' Floridian,' emigrant ship, which have so often
appalled the public, and which as oft& have been passed over without effort to prevent their recurrence or to
lessen their effects. On laud we have our inquests, public attention is enforced, and thence results a tendency
to obviate the possibility of the same calamities. With disasters a t sea it is otherwise. W e practise the fatalism
of the Turks, which we so easily condemn-our feelings soothe themselves by a few pathetic exclamations, and
all is forgotten. I n the unhappy case of the Floridia~h the first boat capsized ; the second was overfilled by a
frantic rush of the passengers and shared the same fat;. So it always has been. The Ocean Momrch gave the
same melancholy proof of thelinsufficiency of boats, in moderate weather, in sight of our shores, and in broad
daylight. I t is evident we must turn to something else-we must try a new plan : the old plans do nothing for
Us. We have endeavoured to recall all the new ideas we have heard on this subject. W e find amongst them
one which is not only a novel but very ingenious application of a fact known to every schoolboy-one rationally
entitled to attention, becauie it is founded on the experience of everybody. W e learn to swim by cork; its
 indestructable buoyancy is known by all the world.
       " On Saturday last we observed a very able article in a n influential weekly contemporary, from which we
extract the following :-
       " ' I n the early part of last year public attention was very generally directed to a n invention for saving life
 and property a t sea in cases of shipwreck or sudden calamity, which appeared a t once so simple and efficacious
 a s to lead to the belief that a mode a t last had been discovered of avoiding or mitigating the unspeakable
 horrors Of shipwreck. W e allude to numerous experiments which took place before distinguished naval autbo-
 rities and the public a t large on the Serpentine at Woolwich Dock-yard and a t various sea-ports of the
 kingdom, to test the ability of k o ~ kshredded,
                                          ,          so a: to adapt it for the ordin& stuffing of mattresses, bolsters,
 squabs, and the common furniture and bedding of a ship's company ; t o afford ready and, humanly speaking,
 certain means of saving the lives of passengers and crew, and possibly the cargo of a vessel, when threatened
 wlth destruction by storm and shipwreck. Those experiments were, in all cases, so eminently successful, and
 the approbation of the naval men so universally acceded ; that it was fairly assumed that not only government,
 but the whole shipping interest, would lose no time in coming t o a n arrangement with the patentees for the
 application and adoption of such an invaluable invention in our magnificent navy and vast mercantile marine.
 W e beard, with much satisfaction, that the Admiralty had made a beginning by ordering that one of the Arctic
 vessels Sent in search of Sir J. Franklin should be supplied with these patent life-preserving mattresses, and
 that more than one foreign government)had sent orders to this country for a quantity of the same articles,
 with the avowed purpose, if found to answer the end for which they were invented, of introducing them gene-
 rally into their war ships and their commercial marine. For some months, however, we lost sight of this
 admirable invention, and we presumed that either the political and social hurricane which shattered so many
 sound and hopeful projects had shelvedit for a while or that the production of the material was too Costly
 for general application. The delay in bringing forwa;d this invention prominently it now seems, was owing
 t o difficulties of a purely mechanical nature, which, after much time, large expense1and scientific labour, have
 been thoroughly overcome. W e need hardly say that cork is not a very manageable substance. To produce it
 shredded, of various length of staple and fineness-if we may use these terms-it is essential to have very
 ingenious and complicated machinery. I t is no detriment to any popular invention whatever, to say, that it
 i s seldom produced in perfection a t once. and so it happened with reference to the cork stuffing ; it being
 found that the machinery first constructed <or the purpose of shredding the cork was defective in certain essential
 qualities, that it could not produce the material in quantity sufficient to meet the extensive orders which
 came pouring in as soon as the importance and efficacy of the life-preserving mattresses were known, and
 further, that the quantity produced was, of necessity, a t an enhanced cost, not contemplated by the patentees.
 W e now find that the machinery for the production of the corkstuffing is perfect, Any quantity can he furnished,
 and any fibre--to use a familiar illustration, from the size of a maccaroni to vermicelli-can he produced with
 facility. As far as what we may term the principle of this patent cork stuffing is concerned, the perfect
 adaptation to its purpose is beyond all question. Let us just remind the reader of one or two results attamed
 a t some of the public experiments. I t has already been stated that one of the great and important uses of the
 cork stuffing is, T H A T I T R E Q U I R E S NO E X T R A STOWAGE ROOM I N VESSELS. Thesailors'sea-
 bedding, thecushions of the seats and benches in ships or pleasure boats, pfovided with this patent stpffing, become
 i n an instant,in case of need so many life preservers. Each sailor, oihcer, or passenger, is furnished wlth a n
                               d
 instantaneous means, if not saving life in all cases, yet of sustaining life in the vast majority of vases until ~ s i s t -
  ance from other sources arrives or can he obtained. Now, the problem to be solved by these expepments was, what
  quantity of the stuffing, either in a mattress or a squab, would suffice to sustain a single person In the water, and
 how many could be saved in company, provided several of these mattresses were together converted into a raft.
 Among the experiments before Sir Gordon Bremer and a select party a t the Woolwich Dockyard, was that of
 lashing six of the mattresses together with boat oars, a process almost instantly effected. This raft was thrown
into the dock, and Captain Stevens, the swimming master at the Royal Baths. jumped on it, and floated about
 the dock, quite a t his ease. His son (of course an expert swimmer) performed the feat of a n accidental fall
overboard. The captain, on his raft, made his way instantly to the spot, pulled his son on it, and landed him
again, amid general applause, in the vessel. This was done without depressing the raft perceptibly in the water.
 The quality which belongs exclusively to this kind of raft is, that it can sustain no injury from coming in violent
collision with any part of the wreck, or from grounding upon rock. The huoyancy of the cork remains unaffected,
however much the exterior coverings may he damaged. A BOLSTER,           34lbs. WEIGHT,was next thrown overboard,
and Captain Stevens's son placed himself upon it, and showed that E V E N THIS SMALL HELP WAS PERFECTLY
CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING H I S WEIGHT IN THE WATER FOR A N UNLIMITED SPACE OF TIME. A BOAT-CUSHION, OF
THE SAME WEIGHT, WAS FOUND TO BE QUITE AS EFFICIENT.            Asingle mattress, 131b. in weight, the ordinary size
o f a seaman's bed was then thrown into the water; Captain Stevens, a heavy man, sat, lay a t length, and roiled
about on it, quite)at his ease being supported entirely out of the water. The indestructable buoyancy of the
Patent Cork Stuffingmay he :aid to he now incontestably established. Its applicability, in every emergency, is
also hevond ouestion. Humanitv and interest, seldom found in connection. here iointlv combine to demand i t s
adoption, noi only~hytheship-o&ners but by ihe government. We hope shortly to be able to give some explana-
tion of the many other important saniiary purposes to which this singularsubstance can be adapted."

      THE LATE APPALLING LOSSOF LIFE ON ROARDTHE EATTGRANT                SHIP FLORIDIAN.-THE PATENTCORK
FIBRE.-"Unfortunately for humanity, but fortunately for the humane object we had in view last week, in
drawing attention to the extraordinary properties cork fihre possesses off affording instant assistance in cases of
shipwreck, we have to point to one of the most terrible sacrifices of human life which have recently come under
our notice. An emigrant ship, crammed with human beings from the age of infancy to manhood, is driven by
stress of weather on a sand-bank, in sight of our own coasts, in sight of other vessels, and in a few unavailing
prayers and shrieks for help are hurried into eternity. Can it for a moment be doubted, had this ill-fated vessel
been fitted up in that mode which, last week, we proved the cork fihre could best display its life-sustaining and
buoyant properties namely used as ordinary stuffing for the mattresses, the cushions, the seats in common
use on board that ;he efficient and immediate aid which these instantaneous life-preservers would have afforded,
would in all i u m a n probability have proved the means of rescuing scores from the awful and unprepared fate
which suddenly overtook them. I n the name of humanity, we are entitled to demand that no more time he lost
before this cork fihre or something of equal buoyancy and indestructahility, andcapable of similar adaptation, if
i t is possible to find such another material (which we doubt), he immediately made the ready instrument of
assisting to save life in case of shipwreck, so that we may no more have our feelings harrowed from reading details
like those furnished by the Floridian catastrophe, with the knowledge in our minds that a simple substance such
as the cork fibre could have rendered effectual aid, had it been a t hand, as it ought to have been."-Railway
Gazette.

     PRESERVATION     OF LIFE FROM SHIPWRECK.-PATENT        CORKSTUFFING.-" W e have frequently had occasion
t o notice various inventions from time to time brought before the public for the purpose of saving life in case of
shipwreck and other accidents arising from 'the perils of the deep'; but we have certainly met with none which
appears t; he so effective as the means lately adopted of shredding cork, and applying it to the stuffing of
mattresses, bolsters, cushions, and other portions of furniture used in a ship's fitting. The great buoyancy of
cork is too well known to require comment-the only objection hitherto raised against its adoption as a life
preserver has been its bulk, and consequent inconvenience, but itsutility for the purpose above mentioned having
been thoroughly tested, the previous objections are entirely obviated. I n fitting a vessel with furniture composed
as much as possible of cork, the buoyant body thrown upon the water, in a case of wreck, would he very great ;
and, consequently, the chance of escape to the persons on board would be increased in an equal, if not greater,
ratio."-Shipping Gasette.

    SHIPWRECKS      A N D THE MEANSOF PRESERVING       LIFE.-" The catalogue of the numerous wrecks, and the
particulars of the awful loss of human life which have appeared in the daily journals during the last ten days,
would almost fill the eight pages of our Gazefie. The loss of the West India mail packet Forthhas been more than
confirmed by startling details from officers and passengers. happily, the destruction of property is the only
circumstaAce to be regretted. On the coast of Scotland, abou; a score of poor fishermen have become victims to
their perilous calling and from the M'elsh coast reports reach us daily of missing vessels and crews ; hut the
harrowing tale of the)week is the total loss of another emigrant ship on the Long Sands, coast Of Essex-(the
Floridian, boundto New York)-when, out of crew and passengers amounting to 174, no less than 170 perished,
the only survivors in this dreadful catastrophe being three seamen and one passenger, who were saved by the
Peterel, revenue cutter, and taken to Harwich. With these heart-rending details hourly before us-disasters in
fine weather, as well as such awful accidents as happened to the Floridian in the stormy seasons of the year-we
fear we become too indifferent to the calls of humanity, and callous to the sense of duty whlch ought to lmpel us,
a s Christians and Englishmen, to attempt a t least, with the means which science, ingenuity, and experience have
provided, t o save the lives of our fellow-creatures. On shore we have life-boats wlthout end, and we have stout
hearts to man them, hut they are unfortunately seldom or never a t the point of danger, or a t hand a t the call of
the helpless passenger or worn-out mariner. W e insist upon all our shipping craft, royal or mercantile, being
provided with well-found boats ; but with the mere sustaining principles of flotation which are derived from the
form, the structure, and the material of which they are composed, although adapted in fine weather to answer the
purpose required of them, yet they are in constant danger of being swamped by over-croadlng ; and in rough
weatirer howrarely do they ever come up to expectation. I t is clear, then, that something beyond boats isrequired
to preserve life, and to give an assurance of safety and that presence of mind so vital to the welfare of individuals
as well as to crews. W e want an auxiliary to boats-a last resource-a means of continuous SuSteniation in a n
element like water, which may recal, intuitively, the despairing wretch from the wild shriek of departing exist-
ence, to a sense of animation and hope, and confidence, that may induce him to prolong his struggles with the
K I I Iof~ Terrors.
      '' Jt would be unjust to those philnnthropic indiviJ~:als who have spent tlleir lives, as well ns their fdrtunes,
i n the attempt to nvuturc sucll an ever nvoilaLle support for the hourof danger, if wedid not notice their lautlnble
efiorts. Captain Slnith, 1t.S. ; Jlr. Holdsaortl~,of J).irt~nouth; Mr. Alfred Helg, inventor of the catamaran ;
aud a scoreuf other e~ninentprojcctors, have brougllt forward various contrivances and appl~ancesmost i~lgenious
and most useful for the purpose of preserving life from shipwreck ; but, imfortuuately, each and all require that
degree of preparation which in moments of frantic terror is never thought of. Their schemes areexcellent in their
way, but theyare not of universal application. No, the desideratum is to be found in some other means, simple,
natural, and forcible, and self-suggestive when once pointed out. W e believe it a t once apparent, in the invention
manufacture, or adaptation of a preparation of cork, called the Patent Stuffing-cork separated by Machine intd
shreds-fibre-applicable     to anything, everything, assuring safety in every article on board a ship, whose specific
gravity is lighter than water-to hammocks, bedding, cushions, bolsters. in the pockets of trousers in caps hats
vests, great coats. in bonnets ay and 'bustles'-even            a n umbrell; or parasol-ought to he'so filled as t;
possess in itself t h i means of & i n i t h e owner or possessor. I t has been tested by experiment, proved by high
authority ; and will, we are persuaded, be adopted ere long by Act of Parliament. Had any of the bedding, or
bolsters, cushions of boats or seats, of the ill-fated Avenger steam frigate been stuffed with this material, the
country would not have mourned the loss of 240 brave and gallant officers and seamen. had the furniture of the
Forth packet been fitted with this cork stuffing, a vast amount of agony of feeling w o n k have been spared. had
Her Majesty's ship Nufine been supplied with it, we are assured that not a single man of the orew would'have
perished,
     " I n a word, for defence in war, or for preservation of life in shipwreck-and, in fact. for a11 the purposes of
humanity, it has been invented and manufactured, and it must work its way."-United Service Gazette, loth
March, 1849.

     ADVANTAGES        OF THE PATENTCORKFIBRE         IN BoATING.-W~ copy from that portion of the columns of tho
Times devoted to the records of mortality, the following melancholy paragraph :-
      "Drowned on Saturday afternoon, caused by the upsetting of a boat on the River Lea a t Ugper CZapton,
                     M r . J . J.R
                                 -,      a%d Mr. T.6'. H,-       Students a t Bartholomew ~ o s i i t a l .
      " I t is precisely in the case of such sudden accidents as these that the cork fibre best displays its value. Had
the boat in which these unhappy young men took their recreation been provided with a seat supplied with the
cork fibre, therecan be no reasonable doubt that the parentsand friends of these young men would not now have
had to mourn their irreparable bereavement. I t is lessons of this sort which teach us the criminality of supineness
in not adopting immediate precautions against fatal accidents, which are a t the commandof every one. W e have
already bestowed some notice on one most important quality of cork, when applied to the purpose of saving life
a t sea. we now devote a few lines to the task of showing that cork may be made available on land if not for
saving7life,a t least for mitigating some of its petty tortures and annoyances. W e learn from very goodjuthority
good we say, because from the testimony of those who have in their own persons experienced the fact that in case;
of rheumatism, thin sheets of cork placed next the skin have an almost magical effect in procuring relief to the
sufferer. W e can easily understand how this should be so : cork not only shields the skin from these sudden
atmospheric changes, so dreaded by the afflicted, but it also excites a salutary action which is thus able to employ
its whole force in expelling the rheumatic pains. This is a matter, we think, well worthy of medico-scientific
investigation, and we shall be glad to find that some skilful and impartial mind has made this matter the subject
of study. We also understand that the cork fibre used for bedding, bolsters and pillows has sanatory properties
of a very high character. The miasmata arising from infectious disease is'not absorbedor retained by the cork
substances the same as in the case of the ordinary kinds of bedding, and this, therefore renders it most suitable
for all large buildings, where many indhiduals sleep under the same roof, such as hosp'itals, union workhouses
barracks, and police stations. There is another quality which must not be overlooked,-the cork fibre neithe;
sustains nor harbours insect life,-an invaluable piece of information t o those who desire undisturbed rest in the
dog days."-Raidway Gazetle,l7th March, 1849.

     THELOSS01"EMIGRANT        SHIPS.-"In calling the attentionof our readers to the loss-if not frequent, yet too
frequent-of passenger and emigrant ships, we are sensible of theinexpediency of alarming timid minds withia vivid
representation of dangen which must be encountered. If the contemplation of danger can do nothing in the way
of enabling us to evade it, it may then be well to close our eyes to its existence.
                                    "Twere well--we fhen had blithly lau.gh'd,
                                     TiZZgtclphingseas had whelmed us o'er :'-
but, the way to be prepared for danger, is to look it boldly in the face. W e have never chanced to sail or
steam it in a passenger vessel without occupying ourselves with asomewhat serious comparison of the number of
passengers on board, with the accommodation afforded by the boats in the event of amishap. Wehave frequently
heard remarks from fellow passengers, indicating that their thoughts were occupied with the same calculation.
Those unsightly things above the paddle-wheels of sea-going steamers, are in the nature of a tribute t o the public
apprehensiveness on this point, but though good so far as they go, they afford but a trifling a,mount of additional
security. EVERYPASSENGER VESSEL OUGHT TO CARRY THE MEANS OF KEEPING ITS WHOLE COMPLEMENT OF
PASSENGERS, TOGETHER WITH I T S CREW, ABOVE WATER FOR A TIME, IN CASE OF ACCIDENT.
     " The first and most obvious requisite would be, that every person should possess a t least so much knowledge
of the art of swimming as would enable him to sustain himself on the water for a short time, and would secure to
him presence of mind to avail himself of the facilities for safety which might be afforded.
     "Suppose then each passenger sufficiently collected to provide for himself, when the hour of danger arrives
then follows the duty of the owners of steam vessels to provide appliances for keeping those who so readily trusi
their lives in their hands, on the surface of the water,until succour may arrive. The avidity with which in those
awful hours everything that will float is seized upon, suggests at once the value of a provision of well-conceived
life-buoys. Every moveable in the ship should be invested with the greatest possible amount of sustaining power.
Much ingenuity has been applied t o this object, and not without considerable effect.
     <'A Hackney Coach is licensed to carry four passengers. W e might consent to a tax upon steam-vessels to
ensure a similar adaptation of the number of passengers to the capacity of the vessel, attended with an efficiknt
inspection to ensure attention to the regulation. How easy it would be t o append to such a system a provision
that, for each passenger, according to the number for which the vessel was licensed, it should carry, SAY A CORK
FLOATING MATTRESS.       These mattresses from the ingenious manipulation which the cork undergoes form com-
fortable beds, andwould therefore cause Ao addition to the ordinary provision for the passengers'acco~modation,
and take no extra room for stowage.'-The Emigran,t, 31st March, 1849.

     COME,Father Neptune ! I 'm disposed to be                         I want to ask what thy opinion is
      A little chatty, for a certain reason:                             Of MOSES'Mart, so famed in this dominion?
     Thou knowest well, as monarch of the sea,                         I know thou art a tolerable quiz,
      That this is what I l l term " a ducking season,"                  Well capable of forming an opinion :
     When multttudes of Britain's sons and dauehters                   Thou'st seen what Messrs. MOSEShave been at. Sir.
/I   Recruit their health and strength beside thy waters.          I   And, therefore, hast thy notion, this or that, Sir.

        CAUTION.-E MOSES & SON regret having to guard the public against imposition, but having Read
     that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or it is the same concern, has been
     resorted to in many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion withany
     other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 36, Fargate, Sheffield, and 19,
     Thornton's Buildings, Bradford, Yorkshire ; and those who desire genuine and cheap Clothing, &c., should
     call at or send to Minories and Aldgate, City, London ; or to the Branch Establishments as above.
        TAKE  NOTICE.-T~~SEstablishment is closed from sunset Friday, till sunset Saturday, when business is
     resumed till 12 o'clock.
       BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NIUOLL), there is
     another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
     name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
     wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
     be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUlNEAS.




       .--
          The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                              Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
    T H E REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Spring Months, with all
 the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two
 GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,
 but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the
 intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,
 within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,
 with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be seen, ready for
 immediate wear, in every size, at the Patentees' Warerooms.

T   H E peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
              FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest material, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,
             GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
  These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
  And also the PATENT CORK FIBRE                               MATTRESS.
FOR T H E PRESERVATION OF L I F E A T SEA.

                  THE EIDER DOWN QUILT
also, is to be seen only at their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
Carriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
  perfect luxury. Their
                            BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, W I T H PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable.
   OLD FEATHER-BEDS re-dressed by this process are perfectly freed from all
impurities ; and, by expanding the Feathers, the bulk is greatly increased, and the
Bed consequently rendered much fuller and softer, a t 3d. per lb.
   OLD AND MOTHY MATTRESSES effectually cured and re-made.

   So long held in high public estimation, the LITERARY     GAZETTE   contillues to afford a
 complete view and record of the National Literature, Science, and the Fine Arts, with the
 addition of Foreign Intelligence on the same subjects from every part of the Civilised
 World. I t has, also, of late, made liberal improvements in the various branches which its
plan has embraced. I n every department of Literature peculiar to Learned Research,
Medical Practice, Philosophy, important Works in Foreign Languages, &c. &c., in addition
to Publications of more general character :-in Science, Voyages, Travels, History, Poetry,
the Fine Arts, Dramatic and Musical Criticism, Gentlemen of ability and experience in
these matters have been incorporated with the regular staff of the JOURNAL        OF BELLES
LETTRES,  and under the same Editorial supervision which has, from 1817, sustained its
Reputation and Influence, and i t is consequently hoped that increased energy and talent
will be manifest throughout the whole, and a Weekly Sheet acknowledged which may justly
challenge comparison with the greatest and best of Periodical Publications.
   During the current year, the most interesting Papers on the Earliest Records of the
Human Race, Philological investigations of the highest importance, and Antiquarian
discoveries and proceedings at home and abroad, have formed a very prominent feature in
nearly every Weekly Number.
   Of these, and all other Literary matters, this Journal is, in fact, the only comprehensive
Exponent in the Periodical Press; and Members of Literary and Scientific Societies, as
well as intelligent readers of every class, who reside in remote parts, may through its
columns be promptly made acquainted with everything that is done or heard of at Head
Quarters. For rising families i t is peculiarly adapted, as i t conveys instruction of every
practical and intellectual kind, mingled with the more amusing literature which is calculated
to attract and interest youthfulminds, till they are filled with the information and knowledge
of the passing time.

                              CHAPTER X.
            I BECOME NEGLECTED, AND AM PROVIDED FOR.

    THE first act of business Miss Murdstone performed when the day of
the solemnity was over, and light was freely admitted into the house, was
to give Peggotty a month's warning. Much as Peggotty would have dis-
liked such a service, I believe she would have retained it, for my sake, in
preference to the best upon earth. She told me we must part, and told
me why; and we condoled with one another, in all sincerity.
    As to me or my future, not a word was said, or a step taken. Happy
they would have been, I dare say, if they could have dismissed me at a
month's warning too. I mustered courage once, to ask Miss Murdstone
when I was going back to school; and she answered dryly, she believed I
was not going back at all. I was told nothing more. I was very anxious
to know what was going to be done with me, and so was Peggotty ; but
neither she nor I could pick up any information on the subject.
    There was one change in my condition, which, while it relieved me of a
great deal of present uneasiness, might have made me, if I had been
capable of considering it closely, yet more uncomfortable about the future.
I t was this. The constraint that had been put upon me, was quite aban-
doned. I was so far from being required to keep my dull post in the
parlor, that on several occasions, when I took my seat there, Miss Murd-
stone frowned to me to go away. I was so far from being warned off
from Peggotty's society, that, provided I was not in Mr. Murdstone's, I
was never sought out or inquired for. At first I was in daily dread of
his taking my education in hand again, or of Miss Murdstone's devoting
herself to it ; but I soon began to think that such fears were groundless,
and that all I had to anticipate was neglect.
    I do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then. I was
still giddy with the shockof my mother's death, and in a kind of stunned
state as to all tributary things. I can recollect, indeed, to have speculated,
at odd times, on the possibility of my not being taught any more, or cared
for any more ; and growing up to be a shabby moody man, lounging an
idle life away, about the village ; as well as on the feasibility of my getting
rid of this picture by going away somewhere, like the hero in a story,
to seek my fortune : but these were transient visions, day dreams I sat
looking at sometimes, as if they were faintly painted or written on the
wall of my room, and which, as they melted away, left the wall blank
again.
    "Peggotty," I said in a thoughtful whisper, one evening, when I was
warming my hands at the kitchen fire, "Mr. Murdstone likes me less than
he used to. He never liked me much, Peggotty; but he would rather not
even see me now, if he can help it."
    " Perhaps it's his sorrow," said Peggotty, stroking my hair.

    " I am sure, Peggotty, I am sorry too. If I believed it was his sorrow,
I should not think of it at all. But it's not that; oh, no, it's not that."
                                                                 H
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPlRIENCE

  "   How do you know it's not that ? " said Peggotty, after a silence.
   "  Oh, his sorrow is another and quite a different thing. He is sorry at
this moment, sitting by the fireside with Miss Murdstone ; but if I was to
go in, Peggotty, he would be something besides."
    " What would he be ? " said Peggotty.
   " Angry," I answered, with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown.
" If he was only sorry, he wouldn't look at me as he does. 1am only
sorry, and it makes me feel kinder."
   Peggotty said nothing for a little while; and I warmed my hands, as
silent as she.
    " Davy," she said at length.
   " Yes, Peggotty ?"
    " I have tried, my dear, all ways I could think of-all     the ways there
are, and all the ways there ain't, in short-to get a suitable service here,
in Blunderstone ; but there 's no such a thing, my love."
   " And what do you mean to do, Peggotty ?" says I, wistfully. " Do
you mean to go and seek your fortune ? "
   " I expect I shall be forced to go to Yarmouth," replied Peggotty, "and
live there."
   " You might have gone farther off," I said, brightening a little, " and
been as bad as lost. I shall see you sometimes, my dear old Peggotty,
there. You won't be quite at the other end of the world, will you?"
   " Contrary ways, please God ! " cried Peggotty, with great animation.
 " As long as you are here, my pet, I shall come over every week of my
life to see you. One day, every week of my life !"
   I feIt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise; but even this
was not all, for Peggotty went on to say :
   " I ' m a going, Davy, you see, to my brother's, first, for another fort-
night's visit-just till I have had time to look about me, and g e t to be
something like myself again. Now, I have been thinking, that perhaps, as
they don't want you here at present, you might be let to go along with
me."
   If anything, short of being in a different relation to every one about
me, Peggotty excepted, could have given me a sense of pleasure at that
time, it would have been this project of all others. The idea of being
again surrounded by those honest faces, shining welcome on me ; of re-
newing the peacefulness of the sweet Sunday morning, when the bells
were ringing, the stones dropping in the water, and the shadowy ships
breaking through the mist ; of roaming up and down with little Em'ly,
telling her my troubles, and finding charms against them in the shells and
pebbles on the beach; made a calm in my heart. It was ruffled next
 moment, to be sure, by a doubt of Miss Murdstone's giving her consent;
but even that was set at rest soon, for she came out to take an evening
grope in the store-closet while we were yet in conversation, and Peggotty,
with a boldness that amazed me, broached the topic on the spot.
   " The boy will be idle there," said Miss Murdstone, looking into a
pickle-jar, " and idleness is the root of all evil. But, to be sure, he would
be idle here-or anywhere, in my opinion."
   Peggotty had an angry answer ready, I could see; but she swallowed it
for my sake, and remained silent.
    "Humph ! " said Miss Murdstone, still keeping her eye on the pickles ;
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             99
"  it is of more importance than anything else-it is of paramount import-
ance-that my brother should not be disturbed or made uncomfortable.
I suppose I had better say yes."
    I thanked her, without making any demonstration of joy, lest it should
induce her to withdraw her assent. Nor could I help thinking this a
prudent course, when she looked at me out of the pickle-jar, with as great
an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents.
However, the permission was given, and was never retracted; for when the
month was out, Peggotty and I were ready to depart.
    Mr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty's boxes. I had never
known him to pass the garden-gate before, but on this occasion he came
into the house. And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box
and went out, which I thought had meaning in it, if meaning could ever
be said to find its way into Mr. Barkis's visage.
    Peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her
home so many years, and where the two strong attachments of her life-
for my mother and myself-had been formed. She had been walking in
the churchyard, too, very early; and she got into the cart, and sat in it
with her handkerchief at her eyes.
    So long as she remained in this condition, Mr. Barkis gave no sign
of life whatever. He sat in his usual place and attitude, like a great
stuffed figure. But when she began to look about her, and to speak to
me, he nodded his head and grinned several times. I have not the least
notion at whom, or what he meant by it.
    " It's a beautiful day, Mr. Barkis ! " I said, as an act of politeness.

    " I t ain't bad," said Mr. Barkis, who generally qualified his speech, and

rarely committed himself.
    " Peggotty is quite comfortable now, Mr. Barkis," I remarked, for his
satisfaction.
    " I s she, though ! " said Mr. Barkis.
    After reflecting about it, with a sagacious air, Mr. Barkis eyed her, and
said :
    "Are you pretty comfortable? "
    Peggotty laughed, and answered in the affirmative.
    "But really and truly, you know. Are you?" growled Mr. Barkis,
sliding nearer to her on the seat, and nudging her with his elbow. "Are
you? Really and truly pretty comfortable ? Are you? Eh?" At each of these
inquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer to her, and gave her another nudge;
so that at last we were all crowded together in the left-hand corner of the
cart, and I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear it.
    Peggotty calling his attention to my sufferings, Mr. Barkis gave me
a little more room at once, and got away by degrees. But
I could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a
wonderful expedient for expressing himself in a neat, agreeable, and
pointed manner, without the inconvenience of inventing conversation. H e
manifestly chuckled over it for some time. By-and-by he turned to
Peggotty again, and repeating, " Are you pretty comfortable though? "
bore down upon us as before, until the breath was nearly wedged out of
my body. By-and-by he made another descent upon us with the same
inquiry, and the same result. At length, I got up whenever I saw him
                                     H   2
100           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

coming, and standing on the footboard, pretended to look at the prospect;
after which I did very well.
   H e was so polite as to stop at a public-house, expressly on our
account, and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer. Even when
Peggotty was in the act of drinking, he was seized with one of those
approaches, and almost choked her. But as we drew nearer to the end
of our journey, he had more to do and less time for gallantry; and when
we got on Yarmouth pavement, we were all too much shaken and jolted,
I apprehend, to have any leisure for any thing else.
   Mr. Peggotty and Ham waited for us at the old place. They received
me and Peggotty in an affectionate manner, and shook hands with Mr.
Barkis, who, with his hat on the very back of his head, and a shame-faced
leer upon his countenance, and pervading his very legs, presented but a
vacant appearance, I thought. They each took one of Peggotty's trunks,
and we were going away, when Mr. Barkis solemnly made a sign to me
with his forefinger to come under an archway.
   " I say," growled Mr. Barkis, " it was all right."
   I looked up into his face, and answered, with an attempt to be very
profound : " Oh ! "
   " It didn't come to a end there," said Mr. Barkis, nodding con-
fidentially. " I t was all right."
   Again I answered : c c Oh ! "
   " You know who was willin'," said my friend. " I t was Barkis, and
Barkis only."
   I nodded assent.
   " It's all right," said Mr. Barkis, shaking hands ; " I 'm a friend of
your'n. You made it all right, first. I t ' s all right."
   I n his attempts to be particularly lucid, Mr. Barkis was so extremely
mysterious, that I might have stood looking in his face for an hour, and
most assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out of
the face of a clock that had stopped, but for Peggotty's calling me away.
As we were going along, she asked me what he had said; and I told her
he had said it was all right.
   " Like his impudence," said Peggotty, "but I don't mind that!
Davy dear, what should you think if I was to think of being married? "
   " Why-I     suppose you would like me as much then, Peggotty, as you
do now ? " I returned, after a little consideration.
   Greatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street, as well as
of her relations going on before, the good soul was obliged to stop and
embrace me on the spot, with many protestations of her unalterable love.
   " Tell me what should you say, darling? " she asked again, when this

was over, and we were walking on.
   'r If you were thinking of being married-to     Mr. Barkis, Peggottg? "
   " Yes," said Peggotty.
   c6 I should think it would be a very good thing.      For then you know,
Peggotty, you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to
see me, and could come for nothing, and be sure of coming."
    cr The sense of the dear ! " cried Peggotty.       " What I have been
thinking of, this month back ! Yes, my precious ; and I think I should
be more independent altogether, you see ; let alone my working with a
better heart in my own house, than I could in anybody else's now. I

  don't know what I might be fit for, now, as a servant to a stranger.
  And I shall be always near my pretty's resting-place," said Peggotty
  musing, " and able to see it when I like ; and when I l i e down to rest, I
  may be laid not far off from my darling girl ! "
     We neither of us said anything for a little while.
     " But I wouldn't so much as give it another thought," said Peggotty,

  cheerily, "if my Davy was anyways against it-not if I had been asked
 in church thirty times three times over, and was wearing out the ring in
 my pocket."
     " Look at me, Peggotty," I replied ; " and see if I am not really glad,
 and don't truly wish it ! " As indeed I did, with all my heart.
     " Well, my life,"  said Peggotty, giving me a squeeze, " I have thought of
 it night and day, every way I can, and I hope the right way; but I'll think
 of it again, and speak to my brother about it, and in the meantime we 11keep
 it to ourselves, Davy, you and me. Barkis is a good plain creetur'," said Peg-
 gotty, " and if I tried to do my duty by him, I think it would be my fault if
 I wasn't -if I wasn't pretty comfortable," said Peggotty, laughing heartily.
     This quotation from Mr. Barkis was so appropriate, and tickled us both
 so much, that we laughed again and again, and were quite in a pleasant
 humour when we came within view of Mr. Peggotty's cottage.
     I t looked just the same, except that it may, perhaps, have shrunk a little
 in my eyes; and Mrs. Gummidge was waiting at the door as if she had
 stood there ever since. All within was the same, down to the seaweed in
 the blue mug in my bedroom. I went into the out-house to look about
me ;and the very same lobsters, crabs, and crawfish possessed by the same
 desire to pinch the world in general, appeared to be in the same state of
conglomeration in the same old corner.
    But there was no little Em'ly to be seen, so I asked Mr. Peggotty
where she was.
    " She's at school, sir," said Mr. Peggotty, wiping the heat consequent

on the porterage of Peggotty's box from his forehead ; " she '11 be home,"
looking at the Dutch clock, "in from twenty minutes to half-an-hour's
time. We all on us feel the loss of her, bless ye !"
    Mrs. Gummidge moaned.
    " Cheer up, Mawther ! " cried Mr. Peggotty.

    " I feel it more than anybody else," said Mrs. Gummidge ; cc I 'm a

lone lorn creetur', and she used to be a'most the only think that didn't go
contrairy with me."
    Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering and shaking her head, applied herself to
blowing the fire. Mr. Peggotty, looking round upon us while she was so
engaged, said in a low voice, which he shaded with his hand : " The old
'un ! " From this I rightly conjectured that no improvement had taken
place since my last visit in the state of Mrs. Gummidge's spirits.
    Now, the whole place was, or it should have been, quite as delightful a
place as ever; and yet it did not impress me in the same way. I felt
rather disappointed with it. Perhaps it was because little Em'ly was not
at home. I knew the way by which she would come, and presently found
myself strolling along the path to meet her.
    A figure appeared in the distance before long, and I soon knew it to be
Em'ly, who was a little creature still in stature, though she was grown. But
when she drew nearer, and I saw her blue eyes looking bluer, and her dimpled
10%            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

face looking brighter, and her whole self prettier and gayer, a curious
feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her, and pass by
as if I were looking at something a long way off. I have done such a
thing since in later life, or I am mistaken.
   Little Em'ly didn't care a bit. She saw me well enough ;but instead of
turning round and calling after me, ran away laughing. This obliged me
to run after her, and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage
before I caught her.
   " Oh, it's you, is it ? " said little Em'ly.
   "Why, you knew who it was, Em'ly," said I.
   " And didn't you know who it was ?" said Em'ly. I was going to kiss
her, but she covered her cherry lips with her hands, and said she wasn't a
baby now, and ran away, laughing more than ever, into the house.
   She seemed to delight in teasing me, which was a change in her I won-
dered at very much. The tea-table was ready, and our little locker
was put out in its old place, but instead of coming to sit by me, she went
and bestowed her company upon that grumbling Mrs. Gummidge : and
on Mr. Peggotty's inquiring why, rumpled her hair all over her face to
hide it, and would do nothing but laugh.
   " A little puss, it is! " said Mr. Peggotty, patting her with his great hand.
   " So sh' is ! so sh' is ! " cried Ham. " Mas'r Davy boy, so sh' is ! "
and he sat and chuckled at her for some time, in a state of mingled admira-
tion and delight, that made his face a burning red.
   Little Em'ly was spoiled by them all, in fact; and by no one more than
Mr. Peggotty himself, whom she could have coaxed into anything, by only
going andlaying her cheek against his rough whisker. That was my opinion,
at least, when I saw her do i t ; and I held Mr. Peggotty to be thoroughly
in the right. But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured, and had such
a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once, that she captivated
me more than ever.
   She was tender-hearted, too ; for when, as we sat round the fire after tea,
an allusion was made by Mr. Peggotty over his pipe to the loss I had sus-
tained, the tears stood in her eyes, and she looked at me so kindly across
the table, that I felt quite thankful to her.
   "Ah ! " said Mr. Peggotty, taking up her curls, and running them over
his hand like water, " here's another orphan, you see, sir. And here,"
said Mr. Peggotty, giving Ham a back-handed knock in the chest, "is
another of 'em, though he don't look much like it."
   " If I had you for my guardian, Mr. Peggotty," said I, shaking my head,
" I don't think I should feel much like it."
   "Well said, Mas'r Davy bo' ! " cried Ham, in an ecstasy. '(Hoorah !
Well said ! Nor more you wouldn't ! Hor ! Hor ! "--Here             he returned
Mr. Peggotty's back-hander, and little Em'ly got up and kissed Mr.
Peggotty.
   "And how's your friend, sir ? " said Mr. Peggotty to me.
   " Steerforth? " said I.
   " That 's the name ! " cried Mr. Peggotty, turning to Ham. " I knowed
it was something in our way."
   "You said it was Rudderford," observed Ham, laughing.
   "Well ? " retorted Mr. Peggotty. "And ye steer with a rudder,
don't ye? I t ain't fur off. How is he, sir? "
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   " He was very well indeed when I came away, Mr. Peggotty."
   "   There's a friend ! " said Mr. Peggotty, stretching out his pipe.
" There's      a friend, if you talk of friends ! Why, Lord love my heart
 alive, if it ain't a treat to look at him ! "
    " He is very handsome, is he not ? " said I, my heart warming with this
 praise.
    " Handsome ! " cried Mr. Peggotty. " He stands up to you like-like a
 -why, I don't know what he don't stand up to you like. He's so
 bold ! "
    " Yes ! That 's just his character," said I.   "He's as brave as a lion,
 and you can't think how frank he is, Mr. Peggotty."
    "And I do suppose, now," said Mr. Peggotty, looking at me through
 the smoke of his pipe, "that in the way of book-learning he'd take the
 wind out of a'most anything."
    "Yes," said I, delighted; "he knows everything. He is astonishingly
 clever."
    "There's a friend !" murmured Mr. Peggotty, with a grave toss of his
head.
    " Nothing seems to cost him any trouble," said I. " He knows a task
if he only looks at it. He is the best cricketer you ever saw. H e will give
you almost as many men as you like at draughts, and beat you easily."
    Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say : " Of
 course he will."
    " He is such a speaker," I pursued, "that he can win anybody over ;
and I don't know what you'd say if you were to hear him sing, Mr.
Peggotty."
    Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: "I have
no doubt of it."
    "Then, he's such a generous, fine, noble fellow," said I, quite carried
away by my favorite theme, "that it's hardly possible to give him as
much praise as he deserves. I am sure I can never feel thankful enough
for the generosity with which he has protected me, so much younger and
lower in the school than himself."
    I was running on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little Em'ly's
face, which was bent forward over the table, listening with the deepest
attention, her breath held, her blue eyes sparkling like jewels, and the
color mantling in her cheeks. She looked so extraordinarily earnest and
pretty, that I stopped in a sort of wonder; and they all observed her at
the same time, for, as I stopped, they laughed and looked at her.
    "Em'ly is like me," said Peggotty, "and would like to see him."
    Em'ly was confused by our all observing her, and hung down her head,
and her face was covered with blushes. Glancing up presently through
her stray curls, and seeing that we were all looking at her still (I am
sure, I, for one, could have looked at her for hours), she ran away, and
kept away till it was nearly bedtime.
    I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat, and the wind
came moaning on across the flat as it had done before. But I could not
help fancying, now, that it moaned of those who were gone ; and instead
of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat away,
I thought of the sea that had risen, since I last heard those sounds, and
 drowned my happy home. I recollect, as the wind and water began to
104            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERLENCE

 sound fainter in my ears, putting a short clause into my prayers, petitioning
 that I might grow up to marry little Em'ly, and so dropping lovingly asleep.
    The days passed pretty much as they had passed before, except-it
 was a great exception-that little Em'ly and I seldom wandered on the
beach now. She had tasks to learn, and needle-work to do; and was
 absent during a great part of each day. But I felt that we should not have
had those old wanderings, even if it had been otherwise. Wild and full
of childish whims as Em'ly was, she was more of a little woman than I
had supposed. She seemed to have got a great distance away from me,
inlittle more than a year. She liked me, but she laughed at me, and
 tormented me ;and when I went to meet her, stole home another way, and
was laughing at the door when I came back, disappointed. The best
times were when she sat quietly at work in the doorway, and I sat on the
wooden step at her feet, reading to her. I t seems to me, at this hour, that
I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons ; that
I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see, sitting in
the doorway of the old boat ; that I have never beheld such sky, such
water, such glorified ships sailing away into golden air.
    On the very &st evening after our arrival, Mr. Barkis appeared in an
 exceedingly vacant and awkward condition, and with a bundle of oranges
tied up in a handkerchief. As he made no allusion of any kind to this
property, he was supposed to have left it behind him by accident when he
went away; until Ham, running after him to restore it, came back with
the information that it wasintended for Peggotty. After that occasion he
appeared every evening at exactly the same hour, and always with a little
bundle, to which he never alluded, and which he regularly put behind the
door, and left there. These offerings of affection were of a most various
and eccentric description. Among them I remember a double set of
pig's trotters, a huge pin-cushion, half a bushel or so of apples, a pair of
jet earrings, some Spanish onions, a box of dominoes, a canary bird and
cage, and a leg of pickled pork.
    Mr. Barkis's wooing, as I remember it, was altogether of a peculiar
kind. H e very seldom said anything ; but would sit by the fire in much the
same attitude as he sat in, in his cart, and stare heavily at Peggotty, who
was opposite. One night, being, as I suppose, inspired by love, he made a
dart at the bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread, and put it in his
waistcoat-pocket and carried it off. After that, his great delight was to
produce it when it was wanted, sticking to the lining of his pocket, in a
partially-melted state, and pocket it again when it was done with. H e
seemed to enjoy himself very much, and not to feel at all called upon to
talk. Even when he took Peggotty out for a walk on the flats, he had no
uneasiness on that head, I believe ; contenting himself with now and then
asking her if she was pretty comfortable; and I remember that sometimes,
after he was gone, Peggotty would throw her apron over her face, and
laugh for half-an-hour. Indeed, we were all more or less amused, ex-
cept that miserable Mrs. Gummidge, whose courtship would appear to
have been of an exactly parallel nature, she was so continually reminded
by these transactions of the old one.
   At length, when the term of my visit was nearly expired, it was given
out that Peggotty and Mr. Barkis were going to make a day's holiday
together, and that little Em'ly and I were to accompany them. I had
                        OF DAVID C O P P E R F ~ L D .                 105
but a broken sleep the night before, in anticipation of the pleasure of a
whole day with Em'ly. We were all astir betimes in the morning; and
while we were yet at breakfast, Mr. Barkis appeared in the distance,
driving a chaise-cart towards the object of his affections.
   Peggotty was drest as usual, in her neat and quiet mourning; but
Mr. Barkis bloomed in a new blue coat, of which the tailor had given him
such good measure, that the cuffs would have rendered gloves unnecessary
in the coldest weather, while the collar was so high that it pushed his hair
u p on end on the top of his head. His bright buttons, too, were of the
largest size. Rendered complete by drab pantaloons and a buff waistcoat,
I thought Mr. Barkis a phenomenon of respectability.
   When we were all in a bustle outside the door, I found that
Mr. Peggotty was prepared with an old shoe, which was to be thrown
after us for luck, and which he offered to Mrs. Gummidge for that
purpose.
   "No.       I t had better be done by somebody else, Dan'l," said
Mrs. Gummidge. " I 'm a lone lorn creetur' myself, and everythink that
reminds me of creetur's that ain't lone and lorn, goes contrairy with me."
   " Come, old gal ! " cried Mr. Peggotty. " Take and heave it ! "
    " No, Dan'l," returned Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering and shaking her
head. "If I felt less, I could do more. You don't feel like me, Dan'l ;
thinks don't go contrairy with you, nor you with them ; you had better do
it yourself."
   But here Peggotty, who had been going about from one to another in a
hurried way, kissing everybody, called out from the cart, in which we all
were by this time (Em'ly and I on two little chairs, side by side), that
Mrs. Gummidge must do it. So Mrs. Gummidge did it ; and, I am sorry
to relate, cast a damp upon the festive character of our departure, by
immediately bursting into tears, and sinking subdued into the arms of
Ham, with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden, and had
better be carried to the House at once. Which I really thought was a
sensible idea, that Ham might have acted on.
   Away we went, however, on our holiday excursion; and the first thing
we did was to stop at a church, where Mr. Barkis tied the horse to some
rails, and went in with Peggotty, leaving little Em'ly and me alone in the
chaise. I took that occasion to put my arm round Em'ly's waist, and
propose that as I was going away so very soon now, we should determine to
be very affectionate to one another, and very happy, all day. Little Em'ly
consenting, and allowing me to kiss her, I became desperate ; informing
her, I recollect, that I never could love another, and that I was prepared
to shed the blood of anybody who should aspire to her affections.
   How merry little Em'ly made herself about it ! With what a demure
assumption of being immensely older and wiser than I, the fairy little
woman said I was "a silly boy ;" and then laughed so charmingly that I
forgot the pain of being called by that disparaging name, in the pleasure
of looking at her.
   Mr. Barkis and Peggotty were a good while in the church, but came
out at last, and then we drove away into the country. As we were going
along, Mr. Barkis turned to me, and said, with a wink,-by-the-by,          I
 should hardly have thought, before, that he could wink :
    "What name was it as I wrote up in the cart ? "
106            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   " Clara Peggotty," I answered.
     "What name would it be as I should write up now, if there was a
 tilt here ? "
     " Clara Peggotty, again ? " I suggested.
     "Clara Peggotty BARKIS! " he returned, and burst into a roar of
laughter that shook the chaise.
    I n a word, they were married, and had gone into the church for no
 other purpose. Peggotty was resolved that it should be quietly done ; and
the clerk had given her away, and there had been no witnesses of the
ceremony. She was a little confused when Mr. Barkis made this abrupt
 announcement of their union, and could not hug me enough in token of
 her unimpaired affection; but she soon became herself again, and said she
 was very glad it was over.
    We drove to a little inn in a bye road, where we were expected, and
where we had a very comfortable dinner, and passed the day with great
satisfaction. If Peggotty had been married every day for the last ten
years, she could hardly have been more at her ease about it; it made no
sort of difference in her : she was just the same as ever, and went out for
a stroll with little Em'ly and me before tea, while Mr. Barkis philosophi-
cally smoked his pipe, and enjoyed himself, I suppose, with the contem-
plation of his happiness. If so, it sharpened his appetite; for I distinctly
call to mind that, although he had eaten a good deal of pork and greens at
 dinner, and had finished off with a fowl or two, he was obliged to have cold
boiled bacon for tea, and disposed of a large quantity without any emotion.
    I have often thought, since, what an odd, innocent, out-of-the-way kind
of wedding it must have been ! We got into the chaise again soon after
dark, and drove cosily back, looking up at the stars, and talking about
them. I was their chief exponent, and opened Mr. Barkis's mind to an
amazing extent. I told him all I knew, but he would have believed any-
thing I might have taken it into my head to impart to him; for he had
a profound veneration for my abilities, and informed his wife in my hear-
ing, on that very occasion, that I was " a young Roeshus "-by which I
think he meant, prodigy.
    When we had exhausted the subject of the stars, or rather when I had
exhausted the mental faculties of Mr. Barkis, little Em'ly and I made a
cloak of an old wrapper, and sat under it for the rest of the journey.
Ah, how I loved her ! What happiness (I thought) if we were married, and
were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields, never
growing older, never growing wiser, children ever, rambling hand in hand
through sunshine and among flowery meadows, laying down our heads
on moss at night, in a sweet sleep of purity and peace, and buried by the
birds when we were dead ! Some such picture, with no real world in it,
bright with the light of our innocence, and vague as the stars afar off, was
in my mind all the way. I am glad to think there were two such guileless
hearts at Peggotty's marriage as little Em'ly's and mine. I am glad to think
the Loves and Graces took such airy forms in its homely procession.
    Well, we came to the old boat again in good time at night; and there
Mr. and Mrs. Barkis bade us good-bye, and drove away snugly to their
own home. I felt then, for the first time, that I had lost Peggotty. I
should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but
that which sheltered little Em'ly's head.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           107
   Mr. Peggotty and Ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as
I did, and were ready with some supper and their hospitable faces to drive
it away. Little Em'ly came and sat beside me on the locker, for the
only time in all that visit; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a
wonderful day.
    I t was a night tide; and soon after we went to bed, Mr. Peggotty and
Ham went out to fish. I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary
house, the protector of Em'ly and Mrs. Gummidge, and only wished that
a lion or a serpent, or any ill-disposed monster, would make an attack
upon us, that I might destroy him, and cover myself with glory. But as
nothing of the sort happened to be walking about on Yarmouth flats that
night, I provided the best substitute I could by dreaming of dragons until
morning.
     With morning came Peggotty ; who called to me, as usual, under my
window as if Mr. Barkis the carrier had been from first to last a dream
too. After breakfast she took me to her own home, and a beautiful
 little home it was. Of all the moveables in it, I must have been most
impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlor
 (the tile-floored kitchen was the general sitting-room), with a retreating
 top which opened, let down, and became a desk, within which, was a large
 quarto edition of Fox's Book of Martyrs. This precious volume, of
 which I do not recollect one word, I immediately discovered and imme-
 diately applied myself to ; and I never visited the house afterwards, but
 I kneeled on a chair, opened the casket where this gem was enshrined,
 spread my arms over the desk, and fell to devouring the book afresh.
 I was chiefly edified, I am afraid, by the pictures, which were numerous,
 and represented all kinds of dismal horrors ; but the Martyrs and
Peggotty's house have been inseparable in my mind ever since, and are
 now.
     I took leave of Mr. Peggotty, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge, and little
 Em'ly, that day ; and passed the night at PeggottyJs,in a little room in the
 roof (with the crocodile-book on a shelf by the bed's head) which was to
be always mine, Peggotty said, and should always be kept for me in
exactly the same state.
     '' Young or old, Davy dear, as long as I am alive and have this house
 over my head," said Peggotty, "you shall find it as if I expected you here
 directly minute. I shall keep it every day, as I used to keep your old little
room, my darling ; and if you was to go to China, you might think of it as
being kept just the same, all the time you were away."
    I felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse, with all my heart,
and thanked her as well as I could. That was not very well, for she spoke
to me thus, with her arms round my neck, in the morning, and I was
going home in the morning, and I went home in the morning, with her-
self and Mr. Barkis in the cart. They left me at the gate, not easily or
lightly; and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on, taking
Peggotty away, and leaving me under the old elm-trees looking at the
house, in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking any
more.
    And now I fell into a state of neglect, which I cannot look back upon
without compassion. I fell at once into a solitary condition,-apart from all
friendly notice, apart from the society of all other boys of my own age,
108            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  apart from all companionship but my own spiritless thoughts,-which seems
 to cast its gloom upon this paper as I write.
     What would I have given, to have been sent to the hardest school that
  ever was kept !-to have been taught something, anyhow, anywhere ! No
 such hope dawned upon me. They disliked me ; and they sullenly, sternly,
 steadily, overlooked me. I think Mr. Murdstone's means were straitened
 at about this time ; but it is little to the purpose. He could not bear me;
 and in putting me from him he tried, as I believe, to put away the notion
 that I had any claim upon him-and succeeded.
     I was not actively ill-used. I was not beaten, or starved; but the
 wrong that was done to me had no intervals of relenting, and was done
 in a systematic, passionless manner. Day after day, week after week,
 month after month, I was coldly neglected. I wonder sometimes, when
 I think of it, what they would have done if I had been taken with an
 illness; whether I should have lain down in my lonely room, and lan-
guished through it in my usual solitary way, or whether anybody would
have helped me out.
    When Mr. and Miss Murdstone were at home, I took my meals with
them; in their absence, I ate and drank by myself. At all times I lounged
about the house and neighbourhood quite disregarded, except that they
were jealous of my making any friends : thinking, perhaps, that, if I did,
I might complain to some one. For this reason, though Mr. Chillip often
 asked me to go and see him (he was a widower, having, some years before
that, lost a little small light-haired wife, whom I can just remember con-
necting in my own thoughts with a pale tortoise-shell cat), it was but seldom
that I enjoyed the happiness of passing an afternoon in his closet of a
surgery; reading some book that was new to me, with the smell of the
whole pharmacopceia coming up my nose, or pounding something in a
mortar under his mild directions.
    For the same reason, added no doubt to the old dislike of her, I was
seldom allowed to visit Peggotty. Faithful to her promise, she either
 came to see me, or met me somewhere near, once every week, and never
 empty-handed; but many and bitter were the disappointments I had, in
being refused permission to pay a visit to her at her house. Some few
times, however, at long intervals, I was allowed to go there; and then I
found out that Mr. Barkis was something of a miser, or as Peggotty
dutifully expressed it, was " a little near," and kept a heap of money in a
box under his bed, which he pretended was only full of coats and trousers.
I n this coffer, his riches hid themselves with such a tenacious modesty,
that the smallest instalments could only be tempted out by artifice; so
that Peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate scheme, a very Gun-
powder Plot, for every Saturday's expenses.
    All this time I was so conscious of the waste of any promise I had
given, and of my being utterly neglected, that I should have been perfectly
miserable, I have no doubt, but for the old books. They were my only
comfort; and I was as true to them as they were to me, and read them
over and over I don't know how many times more.
    I now approach a period of my life, which I can never lose the remem-
brance of, while I remember any thing; and the recollection of which has
often, without my invocation, come before me like a ghost, and haunted
happier times.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          109
    I had been out, one day, loitering somewhere, in the listless, meditative
 manner that my way of life engendered, when, turning the corner of a
 lane near our house, I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking with a gentle-
 man. I was confused, and was going by them, when the gentleman cried:
    " What ! Brooks ! "
    "No, sir, David Copperfield," I said.
    "Don't tell me. You are Brooks," said the gentleman. " You are
Brooks of Sheffield. That's your name."
    At these words, I observed the gentleman more attentively. His laugh
 coming to my remembrance too, I knew him to be Mr. Quinion, whom I
 had gone over to Lowestoft with Mr. Murdstone to see, before-it is no
matter-I need not recall when.
    "And how do you get on, and where are you being educated, Brooks ? "
said Mr. Quinion.
    He had put his hand upon my shoulder, and turned me about, to walk
with them. I did not know what to reply, and glanced dubiously at
Mr. Murdstone.
    " He is at home at present," said the latter.   " H e is not being edu-
cated anywhere. I don't know what to do with him. H e is a difficult
subject."
   That old, double look was on me for a moment; and then his eye
darkened with a frown, as it turned, in its aversion, elsewhere.
    "Humph ! " said Mr. Quinion, looking at us both, I thought. "Fine
weather ! "
    Silence ensued, and I was considering how I could best disengage my
shoulder from his hand, and go away, when he said :
    " I suppose you are a pretty sharp fellow still? Eh, Brooks ? "
    "Aye! He is sharp enough," said Mr. Murdstone, impatiently.
"You had better let him go. l i e will not thank you for troubling him."
    On this hint, Mr. Quinion released me, and I made the best of my way
home. Looking back as I turned into the front garden, I saw Mr.
Murdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard, and Mr. Quinion
talking to him. They were both looking after me, and I felt that they
were speaking of me.
   Mr. Quinion lay at our house that night. After breakfast, the next
morning, I had put my chair away, and was going out of the room, when
Mr. Murdstone called me back. He then gravely repaired to another
table, where his sister sat herself at her desk. Mr. Quinion, with his
hands in his pockets, stood looking out of window ; and I stood looking
at them all.
    "David," said Mr. Murdstone, "to the young this is a world for
action ; not for moping and droning in."
   -"As you do," added his sister.
    "Jane Murdstone, leave it to me, if you please. I say, David, to the
young this is a world for action, and not for moping and droning in. I t
is especially so for a young boy of your disposition, which requires a
great deal of correcting ; and to which no greater service can be done than
to force it to conform to the ways of the working world, and to bend it
and break it."
    " For stubbornness won't do here," said his sister.     "What it wants,
is, to be crushed. And crushed it must be. Shall be, too ! "
110            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   H e gave her a look, half in remonstrance, half in approval, and went on :
    "I suppose you know, David, that I am not rich. At any rate, you
know it now. You have received some considerable education already.
Education is costly ; and even if it were not, and I could afford it, I am of
opinion that it would not be at all advantageous t o you to be kept at a
school. What is before you, is a fight with the world; and the sooner
you begin it, the better."
   I think it occurred to me that I had already begun it, in my poor way :
but it occurs to me now, whether or no.
    " You have heard ' the counting-house' mentioned sometimes," said
Mr. Murdstone.
    " The counting-house, sir ? " I repeated.
    "Of Murdstone and Grinby, in the wine trade," he replied.
   I suppose I looked uncertain, for he went on hastily :
    " You have heard the ' counting-house ' mentioned, or the business, or
the cellars, or the wharf, or something about it."
    "I think I have heard the business mentioned, sir," I said, remembering
what I vaguely knew of his and his sister's resources. "But I don't
know when."
   "It does not matter when," he returned. "Mr. Quinion manages that
business."
    I glanced at the latter deferentially as he stood looking out of window.
    "Mr. Quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other
boys, and that he sees no reason why it shouldn't, on the same terms,
give employment to you."
    " H e having," Mr. Quinion observed in a low voice, and half turning
round, " no other prospect, Murdstone."
   Mr. Murdstone, with an impatient, even an angry gesture, resumed,
without noticing what he had said :
    "Those terms are, that you will earn enough for yourself to provide
for your eating and drinking, and pocket-money. Your lodging (which I
have arranged for) will be paid by me. So will your washing-"
    "--Which     will be kept down to my estimate," said his sister.
    "Your clothes will be looked after for you, too," said Mr. Murdstone ;
"as you will not be able, yet awhile, to get them for yourself. So you
are now going to London, David, with Mr. Quinion, to begin the world
on your own account."
    " In short, you are provided for," observed his sister ; "and will please
to do your duty."
   Though I quite understood that the purpose of this announcement was
to get rid of me, I have no distinct remembrance whether it pleased or
frightened me. My impression is, that I was in a state of confusion about
it, and, oscillating between the two points, touched neither. Nor had I
much time for the clearing of my thoughts, as Mr. Quinion was to go upon
the morrow.
   Behold me, on the morrow, in a much-worn little white hat, with a
black crape round it for my mother, a black jacket, and a pair of hard stiff
corduroy trousers-which Miss Murdstone considered the best armour for
the legs in that fight with the world which was now to come off: behold
 me so attired, and with my little worldly all before me in a small trunk,

chaise that was carrying Mr. Quinion to the London coach at Yarmouth!
See, how our house and church are lessening in the distance; how the
grave beneath the tree is blotted out by intervening objects; how the
spire points upward from my old playground no more, and the sky is
empty !




                             CHAPTER XI.

   I KNOW enough of the world now, to have almost lost the capacity of
being much surprised by anything ; but it is matter of some surprise to me,
 even now, that I can have been so easily thrown away at such an age.
A child of excellent abilities, and with strong powers of observation,
 quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt bodily or mentally, it seems wonder-
ful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf. But
none was made ; and I became, at ten years old, a little labouring hind
in the service of Murdstone and Grinby.
   Murdstone and Grinby's warehouse was at the water side. I t was
 down in Blackfriars. Modern improvements have altered the place ; but
it was the last house at the bottom of a narrow street, curving down hill
to the river, with some stairs at the end, where people took boat. I t was
a crazy old house with a wharf of its own, abutting on the water when
the tide was in, and on the mud when the tide was out, and literally over-
run with rats. Its panelled rooms, discolored with the dirt and smoke
of a hundred years, I dare say; its decaying floors and staircase; the
squeaking and scuffling of the old grey rats down in the cellars ; and the
dirt and rottenness of the place ; are things, not of many years ago, in my
mind, but of the present instant. They are all before me, just as they
were in the evil hour when I went among them for the first time, with
my trembling hand in Mr. Quinion's.
   Murdstone and Grinby's trade was among a good many kinds of people,
but an important branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits to
certain packet ships. I forget now where they chiefly went, but I think
there were some among them that made voyages both to the East and
West Indies. I know that a great many empty bottles were one of the
consequences of this traffic, and that certain men and boys were employed
to examine them against the light, and reject those that were flawed, and
to rinse and wash them. When the empty bottles ran short, there were
labels to be pasted on full ones, or corks to be fitted to them, or seals to
be put upon the corks, or finished bottles to be packed in casks. All this
work was my work, and of the boys employed upon it I was one.
   There were three or four of us, counting me. My working place was
established in a corner of the warehouse, where Mr. Quinion could see
me, when he chose to stand up on the bottom rail of his stool in the
counting-house, and look at me through a window above the desk.
112           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

Hither, on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my
own account, the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me
my business. His name was Mick Walker, and he wore a ragged apron
and a paper cap. H e informed me that his father was a bargeman, and
walked, in a black velvet head-dress, in the Lord Mayor's Show. He
also informed me that our principal associate would be another boy whom
he introduced by the-to me-extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes.
I discovered, however, that this youth had not been christened by that
name, but that it had been bestowed upon him in the warehouse, on
account of his complexion, which was pale or mealy. Mealy's father was
a waterman, who had the additional distinction of being a fireman, and was
engaged as such at one of the large theatres ; where some young relation of
Mealy's-I think his little sister-did Imps in the Pantomimes.
    No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this
companionship ; compared these henceforth every-day associates with those
of my happier childhood-not to say with Steerforth, Traddles, and the rest
of those boys ; and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and dis-
tinguished man, crushed in my bosom. The deep remembrance of the sense
I had, of being utterly without hope now ;of the shame I felt in my position ;
of the misery it was to my young heart to believe that day by day what I
had learned, and thought, and delighted in, and raised my fancy and my
emulation up by, would pass away from me, little by little, never to be
brought back any more; cannot be written. As often as Mick Walker
went away in the course of that forenoon, I mingled my tears with the
water in which I was washing the bottles; and sobbed as if there were a
flaw in my own breast, and it were in danger of bursting.
    The counting-house clock was at half-past twelve, and there was general
preparation for going to dinner, when Mr. Quinion tapped at the
counting-house window, and beckoned to me to go in. I went in, and
found there a stoutish, middle-aged person, in a brown surtout and black
 tights and shoes, with no more hair upon his head (which was a large
 one, and very shining) than there is upon an egg, and with a very exten-
 sive face, which he turned full upon me. His clothes were shabby, but
 he had an imposing shirt-collar on. He carried a jaunty sort of a stick,
 with a large pair of rusty tassels to it ; and a quizzing-glass hung outside
 his coat,-for ornament, I afterwards found, as he very seldom looked
 through it, and couldn't see anything when he did.
     "This," said Mr. Quinion, in allusion to myself, "is he."
     "This," said the stranger, with a certain condescending roll in his voice,
 and a certain indescribable air of doing something genteel, which impressed
  me very much, "is Master Copperfield. I hope I see you well, sir ?"
     I said I was very well, and hoped he was. I was sufficiently ill at
  ease, Heaven knows; but it was not in my nature to complain much at
 that time of my life, so I said I was very well, and hoped he was.
     " I am," said the stranger, " thank Heaven, quite well. I have received a
 letter from Mr. Murdstone, in which he mentions that he would desire me
  to receive into an apartment in the rear of my house, which is at
  present unoccupied-and is, in short, to be let as a-in short," said the
  stranger, with a smile and in a burst of confidence, "as a bed-room-the
  young beginner whom I have now the pleasure to-"           and the stranger
  waved his hand, and settled his chin in his shirt collar.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

  cc    This is Mr. Micawber," said Mr. Quinion to me.
    <' Ahem !" said the stranger, cc that is my name."
    c c Mr. Micawber," said Mr. Quinion, " is known to Mr. Murdstone.
H e takes orders for us on commission, when he can get any. H e has
been written to by Mr. Murdstone, on the subject of your lodgings, and
he will receive you as a lodger."
    I c My address," said Mr. Micawber, "is Windsor Terrace, City Road.

I-in       short," said Mr. Micawber, with the same genteel air, and in
another burst of confidence-" I live there."
    I made him a bow.
        Under the impression," said Mr. Micawber, that your peregrinations
in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive, and that you might have
some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the Modern Babylon in the direc-
tion of the City Road-in short," said Mr. Micawber, in another burst of
confidence, " that you might lose yourself-I shall be happy to call this
evening, and install you in the knowledge of the nearest way."
    I thanked him with all my heart, for it was friendly in him to offer to
take that trouble.
    cc At what hour," said Mr. Micawber, " shall I -"
     c c At about eight," said Mr. Quinion.
     I CAt about eight," said Mr. Micawber.      I beg to wish you good day,
Mr. Quinion. I will intrude no longer."
     So he put on his hat, and went out with his cane under his arm: very
upright, and humming a tune when he was clear of the counting-house.
     Mr. Quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as I could in
the warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby, at a salary, I think, of six shil-
lings a week. I am not clear whether it was six or seven. I am inclined
to believe, from my uncertainty on this head, that it was six at first and
seven afterwards. He paid me a week down (from his own pocket, I
 believe), and I gave Mealy sixpence out of it to get my trunk carried to
Windsor Terrace at night: it being too heavy for my strength, small as
it was. I paid sixpence more for my dinner, which was a meat pie and a
turn at a neighbouring pump ; and passed the hour which was allowed for
that meal, in walking about the streets.
     At the appointed time in the evening, Mr. Micawber reappeared. I
washed my hands and face, to do the greater honour to his gentility, and
we walked to our house, as 1 suppose I must now call it, together;
 Mr. Micawber impressing the names of streets, and the shapes of corner
 houses upon me, as we went along, that I might find my way back,
easily, in the morning.
     Arrived at his house in Windsor Terrace (which I noticed was shabby
like himself, but also, like himself, made all the show it could), he pre-
 sented me to Mrs. Micawber, a thin and faded lady, not at all young, who
 was sitting in the parlor (the first floor was altogether unfurnished, and
 the blinds were kept down to delude the neighbours), with a baby at her
 breast. This baby was one of twins; and I may remark here that I
hardly ever, in all my experience of the family, saw both the twins detached
 from Mrs. Micawber at the same time. One of them was always taking-
 refreshment.
    There were two other children; Master Micawber, aged about four,
 and Miss Micawber, aged about three. These, and a dark-complexioned
                                                                 I
114           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

young woman, with a habit of snorting, who was servant to the family,
and informed me, before half-an-hour had expired, that she was " a
 Orfling," and came from St. Luke's workhouse, in the neighbourhood,
completed the establishment. My room was at the top of the house, at
the back : a close chamber ; stencilled all over with an ornament which my
young imagination represented as a blue muffin; and very scantily furnished.
    " I never thought," said Mrs. Micawber, when she came up, twin and
all, to show me the apartment, and sat down to take breath, "before
I was married, when I lived with papa and mama, that I should
ever find it necessary to take a lodger. But Mr. Micawber being in
difficulties, all considerations of private feeling must give way."
    I said : "Yes, ma'am."
    " Mr. Micawber's difficulties are almost overwhelming just at present,"
said Mrs. Micawber ; "and whether it is possible to bring him through
them, I don't know. When I lived at home with papa and mama, I
really should have hardly understood what the word meant, in the sense
in which I now employ it, but experientia does it-as papa used to say."
   I cannot satisfy myself whether she told me that Mr. Micawber had
been an officer in the Marines, or whether I have imagined it. I only know
that I believe to this hour that he was in the Marines once upon a time,
without knowing why. He was a sort of town traveller for a number of
miscellaneous houses, now ; but made little or nothing of it, I am afraid.
    "If Mr. Micawber's creditors will not give him time," said Mrs.
Micawber, " they must take the consequences ; and the sooner they bring
it to an issue the better. Blood cannot be obtained from a stone, neither can
anything on account be obtained at present (not to mention law expenses)
from Mr. Micawber."
    I never can quite understand whether my precocious self-dependence
confused Mrs. Micawber in reference to my age, or whether she was so full
of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very twins if
there had been nobody else to communicate with, but this was the strain
in which she began, and she went on accordingly all the time I knew her.
    Poor Mrs. Micawber ! She said she had tried to exert herself; and so,
I have no doubt, she had. The centre of the street-door was perfectly
covered with a great brass-plate, on which was engraved " Mrs. Micawber's
Boarding Establishment for Young Ladies :" but I never found that any
young lady had ever been to school there; or that any young lady
ever came, or proposed to come; or that the least preparation was
ever made to receive any young lady. The only visitors I ever saw or
heard of, were creditors. They used to come at all hours, and some of
them were quite ferocious. One dirty-faced man, I think he was a boot-
maker, used to edge himself into the passage as early as seven o'clock in
the morning, and call up the stairs to Mr. Micawber-'I Come ! You ain't
out yet, you know. Pay us, will you? Don't hide, you know; that's
mean. I wouldn't be mean if I was you. Pay us, will you? You just
pay us, d 'ye hear? Come ! " Receiving no answer to these taunts, he
would mount in his wrath to the words " swindlers " and "robbers ;" and
these being ineffectual too, would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing
the street, and roaring up at the windows of the second floor, where he
 knew Mr. Micawber was. At these times, Mr. Micawber would be trans-
 ported with grief and mortification, even to the length (as I was once
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          115
made aware by a scream from his wife) of making motions at himself with
a razor; but within half an hour afterwards, he would polish up his shoes
with extraordinary pains, and go out, humming a tune with a greater air
of gentility than ever. Mrs. Micawber was quite as elastic. I have known
her to be thrown into fainting fits by the king's taxes at three o'clock, and
to eat lamb-chops, breaded, and drink warm ale (paid for with two tea-
spoons that had gone to the pawnbroker's) at four. On one occasion,
when an execution had just been put in, coming home through some
chance as early as six o'clock, I saw her lying (of course with a twin)
under the grate in a swoon, with her hair all torn about her face; but
I never knew her more cheerful than she was, that very same night, over
a veal-cutlet before the kitchen fire, telling me stories about her papa and
mama, and the company they used to keep.
   I n this house, and with this family, I passed my leisure time. My own
exclusive breakfast of a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk, I provided
myself. I kept another small loaf, and a modicum of cheese, on a particu-
lar shelf of a particular cupboard, to make my supper on when I came back
at night. This made a hole in the six or seven shillings, I know well ; and
I was out at the warehouse all day, and had to support myself on that
money all the week. From Monday morning until Saturday night, I had
no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no
support, of any kind, from any one, that I can call to mind, as I hope to
go to heaven !
   I was so young and childish, and so little qualified-how could I be
otherwise?-to undertake the whole charge of my own existence, that
often, in going to Murdstone and Grinby's, of a morning, I could not resist
the stale pastry put out for sale at half-price at the pastrycook's doors,
and spent in that, the money I should have kept for my dinner. Then,
I went without my dinner, or bought a roll or a slice of pudding. I
remember two pudding-shops, between which I was divided, according
to my finances. One was in a court close to St. Martin's Church-at the
back of the church,-which is now removed altogether. The pudding at
that shop was made of currants, and was rather a special pudding, but
was dear, twopennyworth not being larger than a pennyworth of more
ordinary pudding. A good shop for the latter was in the Strand-some-
where in that part which has been rebuilt since. I t was a stout pale
pudding, heavy and flabby, and with great flat raisins in it, stuck in whole
at wide distances apart. I t came up hot at about my time every day, and
many a day did I dine off it. When I dined regularly and handsomely, I had
a saveloy and a penny-loaf, or a fourpenny plate of red beef from a cook's
shop ;or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer, from a miserable
old public-house opposite our place of business, called the Lion, or the
Lion and something else that I have forgotten. Once, I remember
carrying my own bread (which I had brought from home in the morning)
under my arm, wrapped in a piece of paper, like a book, and going to a
famous alamode beef-house near Drury Lane, and ordering a "small plate"
of that delicacy to eat with it. What the waiter thought of such a
strange little apparition coming in all alone, I don't know; but I can see
him now, staring at me as I ate my dinner, and bringing up the other
waiter to look. I gave him a halfpenny for himself, and I wish he hadn't
taken it.
                                      I2
116           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   We had half-an-hour, I think, for tea. When I had money enough, I
used to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread and
butter. When I had none, I used to look at a venison-shop in Fleet-
street ; or I have strolled, at such a time, as far as Covent Garden Market,
and stared at the pine-apples. I was fond of wandering about the
Adelphi, because it was a mysterious place, with those dark arches. I
see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches, on a little
public-house close to the river, with an open space before it, where
some coal-heavers were dancing; to look at whom, I sat down upon a
bench. I wonder what they thought of me !
   I was such a child, and so little, that frequently when I went into the
bar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter, to moisten what
I had had for dinner, they were afraid to give it me. I remember one hot
evening I went into the bar of a public-house, and said to the landlord :
   "What is your best-your very best-ale a glass? " For it was a
special occasion. I don't know what. It may have been my birth-day.
   " Twopence-halfpenny," says the landlord, "is the price of the Genuine
Stunning ale."
   " Then," says I, producing the money, "just draw me a glass of the
Genuine Stunning, if you please, with a good head to it."
   The landlord looked at me in return over the bar, from head to foot,
with a strange smile on his face ; and instead of drawing the beer, looked
round the screen and said something to his wife. She came out from
behind it, with her work in her hand, and joined him in surveying me.
Here we stand, all three, before me now. The landlord in his shirt
sleeves, leaning against the bar window-frame ; his wife looking over the
little half-door ; and I, in some confusion, looking up at them from out-
side the partition. They asked me a good many questions; as, what my
 name was, how old I was, where I lived, how I was employed, and how
 I came there. To all of which, that I might commit nobody, I invented,
I am afraid, appropriate answers. They served me with the ale, though
I suspect it was not the Genuine Stunning; and the landlord's wife,
opening the little half-door of the bar, and bending down, gave me my
money back, and gave me a kiss that was half admiring and half compas-
sionate, but all womanly and good, I am sure.
   I know I do not exaggerate, unconsciously and unintentionally, the scanti-
ness of my resources or the difficulties of my life. I know that if a shilling
were given me by Mr. Quinion at any time, I spent it in a dinner or a
tea. I know that I worked, from morning until night, with common men
and boys, a shabby child. I know that I lounged about the streets,
insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed. I know that, but for the mercy of
God, I might easily have been, for any care that was taken of me, a little
robber or a little vagabond.
   Yet I held some station at Murdstone and Grinby's too. Besides that
Mr. Quinion did what a careless man so occupied, and dealing with a
thing so anomalous, could, to treat me as one upon a different footing from
 the rest, I never said, to man or boy, how it was that I came to be
 there, or gave the least indication of being sorry that I was there. That
 I suffered in secret, and that I suffered exquisitely, no one ever knew but
 I. How much I suffered, it is, as I have said already, utterly beyond my
 power to tell. But I kept my own counsel, and I did my work. I knew
                         OP DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          117
 from the first, that, if I could not do my work as wellas any of the rest, I
 could not hold myself above slight and contempt. I soon became at least
 as expeditious and as skilful as either of the other boys. Though perfectly
 familiar with them, my conduct and manner were different enough from
 theirs to place a space between us. They and the men generally spoke of
 me as "the little gent," or "the young Suffolker." A certain man named
 Gregory, who was foreman of the packers, and another named Tipp, who
 was the carman, and wore a red jacket, used to address me sometimes as
 " David :" but I think it was mostly when we were very confidential, and

when I had made some efforts to entertain them, over our work, with
 some results of the old readings ; which were fast perishing out of my re-
membrance. Mealy Potatoes uprose once, and rebelled against my being
 so distinguished; but Mick Walker settled him in no time.
    My rescue from this kind of existence I considered quite hopeless, and
abandoned, as such, altogether. I am solemnly convinced that I never for
one hour was reconciled to it, or was otherwise than miserably unhappy;
but I bore it ; and even to Peggotty, partly for the love of her and partly
for shame, never in any letter (though many passed between us) revealed
the truth.
    Mr. Micawber's difficulties were an addition to the distressed state of
my mind. I n my forlorn state I became quite attached to the family, and
used to walk about, busy with Mrs. Micawber's calculations of ways and
means, and heavy with the weight of Mr. Micawber's debts. On a Satur-
day night, which was my grand treat,-partly because it was a great thing
to walk home with six or seven shillings in my pocket, looking into the
shops and thinking what such a sum would buy, and partly because I went
home early,--Mrs.Micawber would make the most heart-rendingconfidences
to me; also on a Sunday morning, when I mixed the portion of tea or coffee
I had bought over-night, in a little shaving pot, and sat late at my break-
fast. I t was nothing at all unusual for Mr. Micawber to sob violently at
the beginning of one of these Saturday night conversations, and sing
about Jack's delight being his lovely Nan, towards the end of it. I have
known him come home to supper with a flood of tears, and a declaration
that nothing was now left but a jail ; and go to bed making a calculation of
the expense of putting bow-windows to the house, "in case anything turned
up," which was his favourite expression. And Mrs. Micawber was just the
same.
   A curious equality of friendship, originating, I suppose, in our respec-
tive circumstances, sprung up between me and these people, notwithstanding
the ludicrous disparity in our years. But I never allowed myself to be
prevailed upon to accept any invitation to eat and drink with them out of
their stock (knowing that they got on badly with the butcher and baker,
and had often not too much for themselves), until Mrs. Micawber took me
into her entire confidence. This she did one evening as follows :
    " Master Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber, '< I make no stranger of
you, and therefore do not hesitate to say that Mr. Micawber's difficulties
are coming to a crisis."
   I t made me very miserable to hear it, and I looked at Mrs. Micawber's
red eyes with the utmost sympathy.
    " With the exception of the heel of a Dutch cheese-which is not adapted
to the wants of a young familyH-said Mrs. Micawber, " there is really not
118             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 a scrap of anything in the larder. I was accustomed to speak of the larder
 when I lived with papa and mama, and I use the word almost unconsciously.
 What I mean to express, is, that there is nothing to eat in the house."
    "Dear me ! " I said, in great concern.
    I had two or three shillings of my week's money in my pocket-from
which I presume that it must have been on a Wednesday night when we
held this conversation-and I hastily produced them, and with heartfelt
emotion begged Mrs. Micawber to accept of them as a loan. But that lady,
kissing me, and making me put them back in my pocket, replied that she
couldn't think of it.
    "No, my dear Master Copperfield," said she, "far be it from my
thoughts ! But you have a discretion beyond your years, and can render
me another kind of service, if you will; and a service I will thankfully
accept of."
    I begged Mrs. Micawber to name it.
    " I have parted with the plate myself," said Mrs. Micawber.     " Six tea,
two salt, and a pair of sugars, I have at different times borrowed money on,
in secret, with my own hands. But the twins are a great tie ; and to me,
with my recollections of papa and mama, these transactions are very
painful. There are still a few trifles that we could part with. Mr.
Micawber's feelings would never allow him to dispose of them; and Clickett"
-this was the girl from the workhouse-" being of a vulgar mind, would
take painful liberties if so much confidence was reposed in her. Master
 Copperfield, if I might ask you"-
    I understood Mrs. Micawber now, and begged her to make use of me
 to any extent. I began to dispose of the more portable articles of pro-
 perty that very evening ; and went out on a similar expedition almost
 every morning, before I went to Murdstone and Grinby's.
    Mr. Micawber had a few books on a little chiffonier, which he called the
 library; and those went first. I carried them, one after another, to a
 bookstall in the City Road-one part of which, near our house, was
 almost all bookstalls and bird-shops then-and sold them for whatever
 they would bring, The keeper of this bookstall, who lived in a little
 house behind it, used to get tipsy every night, and to be violently scolded
 by his wife every morning. More than once, when I went there early, I
had audience of him in a turn-up bedstead, with a cut in his forehead or
a black eye, bearing witness to his excesses over night (I am afraid he was
 quarrelsome in his drink), and he, with a shaking hand, endeavouring to
find the needful shillings in one or other of the pockets of his clothes,
which lay upon the floor, while his wife, with a baby in her arms and her
 shoes down at heel, never left off rating him. Sometimes he had lost his
money, and then he would ask me to call again; but his wife had always
 got some-had taken his, I dare say, while he was drunk-and secretly
 completed the bargain on the stairs, as we went down together.
    At the pawnbroker's shop, too, I began to be very well known. The
 principal gentleman who officiated behind the counter, took a good deal
 of notice of me ; and often got me, I recollect, to decline a Latin noun or
 adjective, or to conjugate a Latin verb, in his ear, while he transacted my
 business. After all these occasions Mrs. Micawber made a little treat,
 which was generally a supper; and there was a peculiar relish in these
 meals which I well remember.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          119
   At last Mr. Micawber's difficulties came to a crisis, and he was arrested
 early one morning, and carried over to the King's Bench Prison in the
Borough. He told me, as he went out of the house, that the God of day
had now gone down upon him-and I really thought his heart was broken
and mine too. But I heard, afterwards, that he was seen to play a lively
game at skittles, before noon.
    On the first Sunday after he was taken there, I was to go and see him,
 and have dinner with him. I was to ask my way to such a place, and
just short of that place I should see such another place, and just short of
that I should see a yard, which I was to cross, and keep straight on until
I saw a turnkey. All this I did; and when at last I did see a turnkey
(poor little fellow that I was !), and thought how, when Roderick h d o m
was in a debtor's prison, there was a man there with nothing on him but
an old rug, the turnkey swam before my dimmed eyes and my beating
heart.
    Mr. Micawber was waiting for me within the gate, and we went up to
his room (top story but one), and cried very much. He solemnly con-
jured me, I remember, to take warning by his fate ; and to observe that if
a man had twenty pounds a-year for his income, and spent nineteen pounds
nineteen shillings and sixpence, he would be happy, but that if he spent
twenty pounds one he would be miserable. After which he borrowed a
shilling of me for porter, gave me a written order on Mrs. Micawber for
the amount, and put away his pocket-handkerchief, and cheered up.
   We sat before a little fire, with two bricks put within the rusted grate,
one on each side, to prevent its burning too many coals; until another
debtor, who shared the room with Mr. Micawber, came in from the bake-
house with the loin of mutton which was our joint-stock repast. Then
I was sent up to " Captain Hopkins" in the room overhead, with
Mr. Micawber's compliments, and I was his young friend, and would
Captain Hopkins lend me a knife and fork.
   Captain Hopkins lent me the knife and fork, with his compliments to
Mr. Micawber. There was a very dirty lady in his little room, and two
wan girls, his daughters, with shock heads of hair. I thought it was
better to borrow Captain Ho~kins'sknife and fork, than Captain Hopkins's
comb. The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness, with
large whiskers, and an old, old brown great-coat with no other coat below it.
I saw his bed rolled up in a corner; and what plates and dishes and pots
he had, on a shelf; and I divined (God knows how) that though the two
girls with the shock heads of hair were Captain Hopkins's children,
the dirty lady was not married to Captain Hopkins. My timid station on
his threshhold was not occupied more than a couple of minutes at most ;
but I came down again with all this in my knowledge, as surely as the
knife and fork were in my hand.
   There was something gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner, after all.
I took back Captain Ho~kins'sknife and fork early in the afternoon, and
went home to comfort Mrs. Micawber with an account of my visit. She
fainted when she saw me return, and made a little jug of egg-hot after-
wards to console us while we talked it over.
   I don't know how the household furniture came to be sold for the
family benefit, or who sold it, except that I did not. Sold it was, how-
 ever, and carried away in a van; except the bed, a few chairs, and the
120           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

kitchen-table. With these possessions we encamped, as it were, in the
two parlors of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace; Mrs. Micawber,
 the children, the Orfling, and myself; and lived in those rooms night
 and day. I have no idea for how long, though it seems to me for a
long time. At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison,
where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself. So I took
the key of the house to the landlord, who was very glad to get i t ; and
the beds were sent over to the King's Bench, except mine, for which
a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that
Institution, very much to my satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I had
become too used to one another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling
was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same
neighbourhood. Mine was a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, com-
manding a pleasant prospect of a timber-yard; and when I took possession
of it, with the reflection that Mr. Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis
at last, I thought it quite a paradise.
   All this time I was working at Murdstone and Grinby's in the same
common way, and with the same common companions, and with the same
sense of unmerited degradation as at first. But I never, happily for me no
doubt, made a single acquaintance, or spoke to any of the many boys whom
I saw daily in going to the warehouse, in coming from it, and in prowling
about the streets at meal-times. I led the same secretly unhappy life ;but
I led it in the same lonely, self-reliant manner. The only changes I am
conscious of are, firstly, that I had grown more shabby, and secondly,
that I was now relieved of much of the weight of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber's
 cares ; for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them at their
present pass, and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they
 had lived for a long while out of it. I used to breakfast with them now,
 in virtue of some arrangement, of which I have forgotten the details. I
 forget, too, at what hour the gates were opened in the morning, admitting
 of my going in; but I know that I was often up at six o'clock, and that
 my favorite lounging-place in the interval was old London Bridge, where
I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses, watching the people going
by, or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water, and
lighting up the golden flame on the top of the Monument. The Orfling
met me here sometimes, to be told some astonishing fictions respecting the
wharves and the Tower; of which I can say no more than that I hope I
believed them myself. I n the evening I used to go back to the prison,
and walk up and down the parade with Mr. Micawber ; or play casino
with Mrs. Micawber, and hear reminiscences of her papa and mama.
Whether Mr. Murdstone knew where I was, I am unable to say. I never
told them at Murdstone and Grinby's.
   Mr. Micawber's affairs, although past their crisis, were very much
involved by reason of a certain " Deed," of which I used to hear a great
deal, and which I suppose, now, to have been some former composition
with his creditors, though I was so far from being clear about it then,
that I am conscious of having confounded it with those demoniacal parch-
ments which are held to have, once upon a time, obtained to a great
extent in Germany. At last this document appeared to be got out of the
way, somehow ; at all events it ceased to be the rock-ahead it had been ;
and Mrs. Micawber informed me that "her family " had decided that Mr.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           121
Micawber should apply for his release under the Insolvent Debtors Act,
which would set him free, she expected, in about six weeks.
    " And then," said Mr. Micawber, who was present, " I have no doubt
I shall, please Heaven, begin to be beforehand with the world, and to live
in a perfectly new manner, if-in short, if anything turns up."
    By way of going in for anything that might be on the cards, I call to
mind that Mr. Micawber, about this time, composed a petition to the
 House of Commons, praying for an alteration in the law of imprisonment
for debt. I set down this remembrance here, because it is an instance to
myself of the manner in which I fitted my old books to my altered life,
 and made stories for myself, out of the streets, and out of men and women ;
and how some main points in the character I shall unconsciously develope,
 I suppose, in writing my life, were gradually forming all this while.
    There was a club in the prison, in which Mr. Micawber, as a gentleman,
was a great authority. Mr. Micawber had stated his idea of this petition
 to the club, and the club had strongly approved of the same. Wherefore
 Mr. Micawber (who was a thoroughly good-natured man, and as active a
 creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed, and never
 so happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of
 any profit to him) set to work at the petition, invented it, engrossed it on
 an immense sheet of paper, spread it out on a table, and appointed a time
 for all the club, and all within the walls if they chose, to come up to his
room and sign it.
    When I heard of this approaching ceremony, I was so anxious to see
them all come in, one after another, though I knew the greater part of
 them already, and they me, that I got an hour's leave of absence from
Murdstone and Grinby's, and established myself in a corner for that pur-
pose. As many of the principal members of the club as could be got into
the small room without filling it, supported Mr. Micawber in front of the
petition, while my old friend Captain Hopkins (who had washed himself,
to do honor to so solemn an occasion) stationed himself close to it, to
read it to all who were unacquainted with its contents. The door was
then thrown open, and the general population began to come in, in a long
file : several waiting outside, while one entered, affixed his signature, and
went out. To everybody in succession, Captain Hopkins said : " Have
you read i t ? "-" No."-"       Would you like to hear it read? " If he
weakly showed the least disposition to hear it, Captain Hopkins, in a
loud sonorous voice, gave him every word of it. The Captain would have
read it twenty thousand times, if twenty thousand people would have
heard him, one by one. I remember a certain luscious roll he gave to
such phrases as "The people's representatives in Parliament assembled,"
" Your petitioners therefore humbly approach your honorable house,"
"His gracious Majesty's unfortunate subjects," as if the words were
something real in his mouth, and delicious to taste ; Mr. Micawber, mean-
while, listening with a little of an author's vanity, and contemplating (not
severely) the spikes on the opposite wall.
   As I walked to and fro daily between Southwark and Blackfriars, and
lounged about at meal-times in obscure streets, the stones of which may,
for anything I know, be worn at this moment by my childish feet, I
wonder how many of these people were wanting in the crowd that
used to come filing before me in review again, to the echo of Captain
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

Hopkins's voice ! When my thoughts go back, now, to that slow
agony of my youth, I wonder how much of the histories I invented
for such people hangs like a mist of fancy over well-remembered facts !
When I tread the old ground, I do not wonder that I seem to see and
pity, going on before me, an innocent romantic boy, making his imaginative
world out of such strange experiences and sordid things !




                             CHAPTER XII.
  LIKING LIFE ON M Y OWN ACCOUNT NO BETTER, I FORM A GREAT
                         RESOLUTION.

    IN due time, Mr. Micawber's petition was ripe for hearing; and that
gentleman was ordered to be discharged under the act, to my great joy.
His creditors were not implacable ; and Mrs. Micawber informed me that
even the revengeful bootmaker had declared in open court that he bore
him no malice, but that when money was owing to him he liked to be
paid. H e said he thought it was human nature.
    Mr. Micawber returned to the King's Bench when his case was over, as
 some fees were to be settled, and some formalities observed, before he
 could be actually released. The club received him with transport, and
held an harmonic meeting that evening in his honor ; while Mrs. Micawber
 and I had a lamb's fry in private, surrounded by the sleeping family.
    "On such an occasion I will give you, Master Copperfield," said
 Mrs. Micawber, "in a little more flip," for we had been having some
 already, " the memory of my papa and mama!'
    "Are they dead, ma'am ? " I enquired, after drinking the toast in a
wine-glass.
    " My mama departed this life," said Mrs. Micawber, " before
Mr. Micawber's difficulties commenced, or at least before they became
pressing. My papa lived to bail Mr. Micawber several times, and then
expired, regretted by a numerous circle."
    Mrs. Micawber shook her head, and dropped a pious tear upon the
twin who happened to be in hand.
    As I could hardly hope for a more favourable opportunity of putting a
question in which I had a near interest, I said to Mrs. Micawber :
    "May I ask, ma'am, what you and Mr. Micawber intend to do, now
that Mr. Micawber is out of his difficulties, and at liberty? Have you
settled yet ? "
    " My family," said Mrs. Micawber, who always said those two words
with an air, though I never could discover who came under the denomina-
tion, " my family are of opinion that Mr. Micawber should quit London,
and exert his talents in the country. Mr. Micawber is a man of great
talent, Master Copperfield."
    I said I was sure of that.
    " Of great talent," repeated Mrs. Micawber. " My family are of opinion,
that, with a little interest, something might be done for a man of his ability
 in the Custom House. The influence of my family being local, it is their
                         OF DAVID COPPEREIELD.

wish that Mr. Micawber should go down to Plymouth. They think it
indispensable that he should be upon the spot."
    " That he may be ready?" I suggested.

    " Exactly," returned Mrs. Micawber. "That he may be ready-in
case of anything turning up."
    " And do you go too, ma'am ? "

   The events of the day, in combination with the twins, if not with the
flip, had made Mrs. Micawber hysterical, and she shed tears as she
replied :
    " I never will desert Mr. Micawber. Mr. Micawber may have con-
cealed his difficulties from me in the first instance, but his sanguine temper
may have led him to expect that he would overcome them. The pearl
necklace and bracelets which I inherited from mama, have been disposed
of for less than half their value; and the set of coral, which was the
wedding gift of my papa, has been actually thrown away for nothing.
But I never will desert Mr. Micawber. No!" cried Mrs. Micawber,
more affected than before, " I never will do it! It's of no use asking
me!"
    I felt quite uncomfortable-as if Mrs. Micawber supposed I had asked
 her to do anything of the sort !-and sat looking at her in alarm.
    "Mr. Micawber has his faults. I do not deny that he is improvident.
 I do not deny that he has kept me in the dark as to his resources and his
liabilities, both," she went on, looking at the wall ; "but I never will desert
Mr. Micawber ! "
    Mrs. Micawber having now raised her voice into a perfect scream, I was
 so frightened that I ran off to the club-room, and disturbed Mr. Micawber
 in the act of presiding at a long table, and leading the chorus of
                         Gee up, Dobbin,
                         Gee ho, Dobbin,
                         Gee up, Dobbin,
                         Gee up, and gee ho-0-0       !
-with the tidings that Mrs. Micawber was in an alarming state, upon
which he immediately burst into tears,and came away with me with his waist-
coat full of the heads and tails of shrimps, of which he had been partaking.
   " Emma, my angel ! " cried Mr. Micawber, running into the room ;
" what is the matter? "
   " I never will desert you, Micawber !" she exclaimed.
   "My life ! " said Mr. Micawber, taking her in his arms.        I am per-
fectly aware of it."
   "He is the parent of my children ! He is the father of my twins ! H e
is the husband of my affections," cried Mrs. Micawber, struggling; " and
I ne-ver-will-desert      Mr. Micawber ! "
   Mr. Micawber was so deeply affected by this proof of her devotion (as
to me, I was dissolved in tears), that he hung over her in a passionate
manner, imploring her to look up, and to be calm. But the more he asked
Mrs. Micawber to look up, the more she fixed her eyes on nothing; and
the more he asked her to compose herself, the more she wouldn't. Con-
sequently Mr. Micawber was soon so overcome, that he mingled his tears
with hers and mine; until he begged me to do him the favor of taking a
chair on the staircase, while he got her into bed. I would have taken my
124           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

leave for the night, but he would not hear of my doing that until the
 strangers' bell should ring. So I sat at the staircase window, until he
 came out with another chair and joined me.
    "How is Mrs. Micawber now, sir ?" I said.
      Very low," said Mr. Micawber, shaking his head ; " re-action. Ah,
this has been a dreadful day ! We stand alone now-everything is gone
from us !"
    Mr. Micawber pressed my hand, and groaned, and afterwards shed
tears. I was greatly touched, and disappointed too, for I had expected
that we should be quite gay on this happy and long-looked for occasion.
But Mr. and Mrs. Micawber were so used to their old difficulties, I think,
that they felt quite shipwrecked when they came to consider that they
were released from them. All their elasticity was departed, and I never
saw them half so wretched as on this night ; insomuch that when the bell
rang, and Mr. Micawber walked with me to the lodge, and parted from
me there with a blessing, I felt quite afraid to leave him by himself, he
was so profoundly miserable.
    But through all the confusion and lowness of spirits in which we had
been, so unexpectedly to me, involved, I plainly discerned that Mr. and
Mrs. Micawber and their family were going away from London, and that
a parting between us was near at hand. I t was in my walk home
that night, and in the sleepless hours which followed when I lay in
bed, that the thought first occurred to me-though I don't know how
it came into my head-which afterwards shaped itself into a settled
resolution.
    I had grown to be so accustomed to the Micawbers, and had been so
 intimate with them in their distresses, and was so utterly friendless with-
 out them, that the prospect of being thrownupon some new shift for a
 lodging, and going once more among unknown people, was like being
 that moment turned adrift into my present life, with such a knowledge of
 it ready made, as experience had given me. All the sensitive feelings it
 wounded so cruelly, all the shame and misery it kept alive within my
breast, became more poignant as I thought of this ; and I determined that
the life was unendurable.
    That there was no hope of escape from it, unless the escape was my
own act, I knew quite well. I rarely heard from Miss Murdstone, and
never from Mr. Murdstone : but two or three parcels of made or mended
clothes had come up for me, consigned to Mr. Quinion, and in each there
was a scrap of paper to the effect that J. M. trusted D. C. was applying
himself to business, and devoting himself wholly to his duties-not the
least hint of my ever being any thing else than the common drudge into
which I was fast settling down.
    The very next day showed me, while my mind was in the first agita-
tion of what it had conceived, that Mrs. Micawber had not spoken of their
going away without warrant. They took a lodging in the house where I
lived, for a week ; at the expiration of which time they were to start for
Plymouth. Mr. Micawber himself came down to the counting-house, in
the afternoon, to tell Mr. Quinion that he must relinquish me on the day
of his departure, and to give me a high character, which I am sure I
 deserved. And Mr. Quinion, calling in Tipp the carman, who was a
married man, and had a room to let, quartered me prospectively on him-
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           125
by our mutual consent, as he had every reason to think; for I said nothing,
though my resolution was now taken.
   I passed my evenings with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, during the remain-
ing term of our residence under the same roof; and I think we became
fonder of one another as the time went on. On the last Sunday, they
invited me to dinner; and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce, and a
pudding. I had bought a spotted wooden horse over-night as a parting
gift to little Wilkins Micawber-that was the boy-and a doll for little
Emma. I had also bestowed a shilling on the Orfling, who was about
to be disbanded.
   We had a very pleasant day, though we were all in a tender state about
our approaching separation.
   " I shall never, Master Copperfield," said W s . Micawber, " revert to
the period when Mr. Micawber was in difficulties, without thinking of
you. Your conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging
description. You have never been a lodger. You have been a friend.''
   "My dear," said Mr. Micawber; " Copperfield," for so he had been
accustomed to call me, of late, " has a heart to feel for the distresses of
his fellow creatures when they are behind a cloud, and a head to plan, and
a hand to-in        short, a general ability to dispose of such available pro-
perty as could be made away with."
   I expressed my sense of this commendation, and said I was very sorry
we were going to lose one another.
   " My dear young friend," said Mr. Micawber, " I am older than you ;

a man of some experience in life, and-and of some experience, in short,
in difficulties, generally speaking. At present, and until something turns
up (which I am, I may say, hourly expecting), I have nothing to bestow
but advice. Still my advice is so far worth taking, that-in short, that I
have never taken it myself, and am the "-here Mr. Micawber, who had
been beaming and smiling, all over his head and face, up to the present
moment, checked himself and frowned-" the miserable wretch you
behold."
   " My dear Micawber !" urged his wife.

   "I say," returned Mr. Micawber, quite forgetting himself, and smiling
again, "the miserable wretch you behold. My advice is, never do
to-morrow what you can do to-day. Procrastination is the thief of time.
Collar him !"
   "My poor papa's maxim," W s . Micawber observed.
   "My dear," said Mr. Micawber, "your papa was very well in his way,
and Heaven forbid that I should disparage him. Take him for all in all,
we ne'er shall-in short, make the acquaintance, probably, of anybody
else possessing, at his time of life, the same legs for gaiters, and able to
read the same description of print, without spectacles. But he applied
that maxim to our marriage, my dear; and that was so far prematurely
entered into, in consequence, that I never recovered the expence."
   Mr. Micawber looked aside at Mrs. Micawber, and added : " Not that I
am sorry for it. Quite the contrary, my love." After which, he was
grave for a minute or so.
   " My other piece of advice, Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, "you
know. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen
six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure
126            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

twenty pounds ought and six, result misery. The blossom is blighted,
 the leaf is withered, the god of day goes down upon the dreary scene, and
 -and in short you are for ever floored. As I am ! "
    To make his example the more impressive, Mr. Micawber drank a glass
of punch with an air of great enjoyment and satisfaction, and whistled the
 College Hornpipe.
    I did not fail to assure him that I would store these precepts in my
mind, though indeed I had no need to do so, for, at the time, they affected
me visibly. Next morning I met the whole family at the coach-office, and
saw them, with a desolate heart, take their places outside, at the back.
    " Master Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber, " God bless you ! I never
can forget all that, you know, and I never would if I could."
    " Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, " farewell ! Every happiness and
prosperity ! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself
that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I
had not occupied another man's place in existence altogether in vain. In
case of anything turning up (of which I am rather confident), I shall be
extremely happy if i t should be in my power to improve your prospects."
   I think, as Mrs. Micawber sat at the back of the coach, with the children,
and I stood in the road looking wistfully at them, a mist cleared from her
eyes, and she saw what a little creature I really was. I think so, because
she beckoned to me to climb up, with quite a new and motherly expression
in her face, and put her arm round my neck, and gave me just such a kiss
as she might have given to her own boy. I had barely time to get down
 again before the coach started, and I could hardly see the family for the
handkerchiefs they waved. I t was gone in a minute. The Orfling and I
 stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle of the road, and then
 shook hands and said good bye ; she going back, I suppose, to Saint Luke's
workhouse, as I went to begin my weary day at Murdstone and Grinby's.
    But with no intention of passing many more weary days there. No.
 I had resolved to run away.-To go, by some means or other, down into
the country, to the only relation I had in the world, and tell my story to
my aunt, Miss Betsey.
    I have already observed that I don't know how this desperate idea
came into my brain. But, once there, it remained there; and hardened
into a purpose than which I have never entertained a more determined
purpose in my life. I am far from sure that I believed there was any-
thing hopeful in it, but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be
carried into execution.
    Again, and again, and a hundred times again, since the night when the
thought had first occurred to me and banished sleep, I had gone over that
old story of my poor mother's about my birth, which it had been one of
my great delights in the old time to hear her tell, and which I knew by
heart. My aunt walked into that story, and walked out of it, a dread and
awful personage ; but there was one little trait in her behaviour which Iliked
to dwell on, and which gave me some faint shadow of encouragement.
I could not forget how my mother had thought that she felt her touch
her pretty hair with no ungentle hand; and though it might have been
altogether my mother's fancy, and might have had no foundation
whatever in fact, I made a little picture, out of it, of my terrible aunt
relenting towards the girlish beauty that I recollected so well and loved
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

 so much, which softened the whole narrative. I t is very possible that
 it had been in my mind a long time, and had gradually engendered my
 determination.
    As I did not even know where Miss Betsey lived, I wrote a long letter
 to Peggotty, and asked her, incidentally, if she remembered ; pretending
 that I had heard of such a lady living at a certain place I named a t
 random, and had a curiosity to know if it were the same. I n the course
 of that letter, I told Peggotty that I had a particular occasion for half a
 guinea; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could repay it, I
 should be very much obliged to her, and would tell her afterwards what I
 had wanted it for.
    Peggotty's answer soon arrived, and was, as usual, full of affectionate
 devotion. She enclosed the half guinea (I was afraid she must have
 had a world of trouble to get it out of Mr. Barkis's box), and told
me that Miss Betsey lived near Dover, but whether at Dover itself,
at Hythe, Sandgate, or Folkstone, she could not say. One of our
men, however, informing me on my asking him about these places, that
they were all close together, I deemed this enough for my object, and
resolved to set out at the end of that week.
    Being a very honest little creature, and unwilling to disgrace the
memory I was going to leave behind me at Murdstone and Grinby's, I
considered myself bound to remain until Saturday night ; and, as I had
been paid a week's wages in advance when I first came there, not to pre-
sent myself in the counting-house at the usual hour, to receive my stipend.
For this express reason, I had borrowed the half-guinea, that I might not
be without a fund for my travelling-expenses. Accordingly, when the
Saturday night came, and we were all waiting in the warehouse to be
paid, and Tipp the carman, who always took precedence, went in first to
draw his money, I shook Mick Walker by the hand; asked him when it
came to his turn to be paid, to say to Mr. Quinion that I had gone to
move my box to Tipp's ; and, bidding a last good night to Mealy Potatoes,
ran away.
    My box was at my old lodging, over the water, and I had written a
direction for it on the back of one of our address cards that we nailed on
the casks: "Master David, to be left till called for, at the Coach Office,
Dover." This I had in my pocket ready to put on the box, after I should
have got it out of the house ; and as I went towards my lodging, I looked
about me for some one who would help me to carry it to the booking-
office.
   There was a long-legged young man with a very little empty donkey-
cart, standing near the Obelisk, in the Blackfriars Road, whose eye I
caught as I was going by, and who, addressing me as " Sixpenn'orth of
bad ha'pence," hoped " I should know him agin to swear to "-in allu-
sion, I have no doubt, to my staring at him. I stopped to assure him
that I had not done so in bad manners, but uncertain whether he might
or might not like a job.
    " Wot job ?" said the long-legged young man.
   '' To move a box," I answered.
   " Wot box ? " said the long-legged young man.
   I told him mine, which was down that street there, and which I wanted
him to take to the Dover coach-office for sixpence.
128            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    "Done with you for a tanner!" said the long-legged young man, and
directly got upon his cart, which was nothing but a large wooden-tray on
wheels, and rattled away at such a rate, that it was as much as I could do
to keep pace with the donkey.
   There was a defiant manner about this young man, and particularly about
the way in which he chewed straw as he spoke to me, that I did not much
like; as the bargain was made, however, I took him up-stairs to the room
I was leaving, and we brought the box down, and put it on his cart. Now,
I was unwilling to put the direction-card on there, lest any of my land-
lord's family should fathom what I was doing, and detain me; so I said
to the young man that I would be glad if he would stop for a minute,
when he came to the dead-wall of the King's Bench prison. The words
were no sooner out of my mouth, than he rattled away as if he, my box,
the cart, and the donkey, were all equally mad; and I was quite out of
breath with running and calling after him, when I caught him at the place
appointed.
   Being much flushed and excited, I tumbled my half-guinea out of my
pocket in pulling the card out. I put it in my mouth for safety, and
though my hands trembled a good deal, had just tied the card on very much
to my satisfaction, when I felt myself violently chucked under the chin by
the long-legged young man, and saw my half-guinea fly out of my mouth
into his hand.
    " Wot ! " said the young man, seizing me by my jacket collar, with a
frightful grin. "This is a pollis case, is i t ? You 're a going to bolt, are
you? Come to the pollis, you young warmin, come to the pollis !"
    "You give me my money back, if you please," said I, very much
frightened- " and leave me alone."
   ?' ~ o r n e i othe pollis ! " said the young man. " You shall prove it
 yourn to the pollis."
    "Give me my box and money, will you," I cried, bursting into tears.
    The young man still replied : " Come to the pollis ! " and was dragging
 me against the donkey in a violent manner, as if there were any affinity
 between that animal and a magistrate, when he changed his mind, jumped
into the cart, sat upon my box, and, exclaiming that he would drive to the
pollis straight, rattled away harder than ever.
    I ran after him as fast as I could, but I had no breath to call out with,
and should not have dared to call out, now, if I had. I narrowly escaped
being run over, twenty times at least, in half a mile. Now I lost him, now I
saw him, now I lost him, now I was cut at with a whip, now shouted at,
 now down in the mud, now up again, now running into somebody's arms,
 now running headlong at a post. At length, confused by fright and heat,
 and doubting whether half London might not by this time be turning out
 for my apprehension, I left the young man to go where he would with my box
 and money ; and, panting and crying, but never stopping, faced about for
 Greenwich, which I had understood was on the Dover Road : taking very
little more out of the world, towards the retreat of my aunt, Miss Betsey,
than I had brought into it, on the night when my arrival gave her so
much umbrage.

   CAUTION.-E MOSES & SON regret having to guard the public against imposition, but having heard
that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or it is the same concern, has been
resorted to in many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion withany
olher House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 36, Fargate, Sheffield, and 19,
Thornton's Buildings, Bradford, Yorkshire ; and those who desire genuine and cheap Clothing, &c., should
call at or send to Minories and Aldgate, City, London ; or to the Branch Establishments as above.
   TAKENo~rc~.-This Establishment is closed from sunset Friday, till sunset Saturday, when business is
resumed till 12 o'clock.
  BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NICOLL), there is
another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUINEAS.




     The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                         Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
   THE REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Summer and Autumnal
Months, with all the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price
of Two GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most
fashionable, but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the
public ; the immense value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA
CLOTH, being, within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability
being retained, with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be
seen, ready for immediate wear, in every size, a t the Patentees' Warerooms.

T   H E peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
              FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest material, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,
             GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
  These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
  And also the PATENT CORK FIBRE                               MATTRESS.
FOR T H E PRESERVATION OF L I F E A T SEA.

                  THE EIDER DOWN QUILT
also, is to be seen only at their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
Carriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                            BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, W I T H PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable.
   OLD FEATHER-BEDS re-dressed by this process are perfectly freed from all
impurities ; and, by expanding the Feathers, the bulk is greatly increased, and the
Bed consequently rendered much fuller and softer, a t 3d. per lb.
   OLD AND MOTHY MATTRESSES effectually cured and re-made.

take its place among those fine though not faultless performances, which will hereafter represent t h e poetical
literature of England in the first half of the nineteenth century. T h e author is, we think, right i n believing

                              CHAPTER XIII.
                     THE SEQUEL OF MY RESOLUTION.

      FORanything I know, I may have had some wild idea of running all
  the way to Dover, when I gave up the pursuit of the young man with the
  donkey cart, and started for Greenwich. My scattered senses were
  soon collected as to that point, if I had; for I came to a stop in the
  Kent Road, at a terrace with a piece of water before it, and a great foolish
  image in the middle, blowing a dry shell. Here I sat down on a door-
  step, quite spent and exhausted with the efforts I had already made, and
 with hardly breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and half-
 guinea.
     I t was by this time dark ; I heard the clocks strike ten, as I sat resting.
 But it was a summer night, fortunately, and fine weather. When I had
 recovered my breath, and had got rid of a stifling sensation in my throat, I
 rose up and went on. I n the midst of my distress, I had no notion of
 going back. I doubt if I should have had any, though there had been a
 Swiss snow-drift in the Kent Road.
    But my standing possessed of only three-halfpence in the world (and
 I am sure I wonder how t h q came to be left in my pocket on a Saturday
 night !) troubled me none the less because I went on. I began to picture
 to myself, as a scrap of newspaper intelligence, my being found dead in a
 day or two, under some hedge ; and I trudged on miserably, though as
 fast as I could, until I happened to pass a little shop, where it was written
 up that ladies' and gentlemen's wardrobes were bought, and that the best
 price was given for rags, bones, and kitchen-stuff. The master of this
 shop was sitting at the door in his shirt sleeves, smoking ; and as there
 were a great many coats and pairs of trowsers dangling from the low
 ceiling, and only two feeble candles burning inside to show what they
were, I fancied that he looked like a man of a revengeful disposition,
who had hung all his enemies, and was enjoying himself.
    My late experiences with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber suggested to me that
here might be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little while. I went
up the next bye-street, took off my waistcoat, rolled it neatly under my
arm, and came back to the shop-door. " If you please, sir," I said, " I
am to sell this for a fair price."
    Mr. Dolloby-Dolloby was the name over the shop-door, at least-
took the waistcoat, stood his pipe on its head against the door-post, went
into the shop, followed by me, snuffed the two candles with his fingers,
spread the waistcoat on the counter, and looked at it there, held it up
against the light, and looked at it there, and ultimately said :
    "What do you call a price, now, for this here little weskit ? "
    " Oh ! you know best, sir," I returned, modestly.
    "I can't be buyer and seller too," said Mr. Dolloby. " Put a price on
this here little weskit."
    "Would eighteenpence be "-I hinted, after some hesitation.
                                                                  K
130            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    Mr. Dolloby rolled it up again, and gave it me back. " I should rob
 my family," he said, "if I was to offer ninepence for it."
    This was a disagreeable way of putting the business ; because it imposed
upon me, a perfect stranger, the unpleasantness of asking Mr. Dolloby to
rob his family on my account. My circumstances being so very pressing,
however, I said I would take ninepence for it, if he pleased. Mr. Dolloby,
not without some grumbling, gave ninepence. I wished him good night,
and walked out of the shop, the richer by that sum, and the poorer by a
waistcoat. But when I buttoned my jacket, that was not much.
    Indeed, I foresaw pretty clearly that my jacket would go next, and that I
should have to make the best of my way to Dover in a shirt and a pair of
trowsers, and might deem myself lucky if I got there even in that trim. But
my mind did not run so much on this as might be supposed. Beyond a
general impression of the distance before me, and of the young man with
the donkey-cart having used me cruelly, I think I had no very urgent sense
of my difficulties when I once again set off with my ninepence in my pocket.
    A plan had occurred to me for passing the night, which I was going to
carry into execution. This was, to lie behind the wall at the back of my
old school, in a corner where there used to be a haystack. I imagined it
would be a kind of company to have the boys, and the bed-room where
I used to tell the stories, so near me: although the boys would know
nothing of my being there, and the bed-room would yield me no shelter.
   I had had a hard day's work, and was pretty well jaded when I came
climbing out, at last, upon the level of Blackheath. I t cost me some
trouble to find out Salem House ; but I found it, and I found a haystack
in the corner, and I lay down by it ;having first walked round the wall, and
looked up at the windows, and seen that all was dark and silent within.
Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lying down, without a
roof above my head !
    Sleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts, against whom
house-doors were locked, and house-dogs barked, that night -and I
dreamed of lying on my old school-bed, talking to the boys in my room;
and found myself sitting upright, with Steerforth's name upon my lips,
looking wildly at the stars that were glistening and glimmering above me.
When I remembered where I was at that untimely hour, a feeling stole
upon me that made me get up, afraid of I don't know what, and walk
about. But the fainter glimmering of the stars, and the pale light in the
sky where the day was coming, reassured me : and my eyes being very
heavy, I lay down again, and slept-though with a knowledge in my sleep
that it was cold-until the warm beams of the sun, and the ringing of the
 getting-up bell at Salem House, awoke me. If I could have hoped that
 Steerforth was there, I would have lurked about until he came out alone ;
 but I knew he must have left long since. Traddles still remained, perhaps,
 but it was very doubtful; and I had not sufficient confidence in his discre-
 tion or good luck, however strong my reliance was on his good-nature, to
 wish to trust him with my situation. So I crept away from the wall as
 Mr. Creakle's boys were getting up, and struck into the long dusty track
 which I had first known to be the Dover road when I was one of them,
 and when I little expected that any eyes would ever see me the wayfarer
 I was now, upon it.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          131
    What a different Sunday morning from the old Sunday morning at
Yarmouth ! I n due time I heard the church-bells ringing, as I plodded on ;
and I met people who were going to church; and I passed a church or
two where the congregation were inside, and the sound of singing came
out into the sun-shine, while the beadle sat and cooled himself in the
shade of the porch, or stood beneath the yew-tree, with his hand to his
forehead, glowering at me going by. But the peace and rest of the old
Sunday morning were on everything, except me. That was the difference.
I felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust, and with my tangled hair. But
for the quiet picture I had conjured up, of my mother in her youth and
beauty, weeping by the fire, and my aunt relenting to her, I hardly
think I should have had courage to go on until next day. But it always
went before me, and I followed.
   I got, that Sunday, through three-and-twenty miles on the straight road,
though not very easily, for I was new to that kind of toil. I see myself,
as evening closes in, coming over the bridge at Rochester, footsore and
tired, and eating bread that I had bought for supper. One or two little
houses, with the notice, "Lodgings for Travellers," hanging out, had
tempted me; but I was afraid of spending the few pence I had, and was
even more afraid of the vicious looks of the trampers I had met or over-
taken. I sought no shelter, therefore, but the sky; and toiling into
Chatham,-which, in that night's aspect, is a mere dream of chalk, and
drawbridges, and mastless ships in a muddy river, roofed like Noah's
arks,-crept, at last, upon a sort of grass-grown battery overhanging a
lane, where a sentry was walking to and fro. Here I lay down, near a
cannon; and, happy in the society of the sentry's footsteps, though he
knew no more of my being above him than the boys at Salem House had
known of my lying by the wall, slept soundly until morning.
   Very stiff and sore of foot I was in the morning, and quite dazed by
the beating of drums and marching of troops, which seemed to hem me
in on every side when I went down towards the long narrow street.
Feeling that I could go but a very little way that day, if I were to reserve
any strength for getting to my journey's end, I resolved to make the sale
of my jacket its principal business. Accordingly, I took the jacket off,
that I might learn to do without it ; and carrying it under my arm,
began a tour of inspection of the various slop-shops.
   I t was a likely place to sell a jacket in; for the dealers in second-hand
clothes were numerous, and were, generally speaking, on the look-out for
customers at their shop-doors. But as most of them had, hanging up
among their stock, an officer's coat or two, epaulettes and all, I was
rendered timid by the costly nature of their dealings, and walked about
for a long time without offering my merchandize to any one.
    This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops,
and such shops as Mr. Dolloby's, in preference to the regular dealers. At
last I found one that I thought looked promising, at the corner of a dirty
lane, ending in an inclosure full of stinging nettles, against the palings of
which some second-hand sailors' clothes, that seemed to have overflowed
 the shop, were fluttering among some cots, and rusty guns, and oilskin
 hats, and certain trays full of so many old rusty keys of so many sizes
 that they seemed various enough to open all the doors in the world.

132           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    Into this shop, which was low and small, and which was darkened
rather than lighted by a little window, overhung with clothes, and was
descended into by some steps, I went with a palpitating heart ; which was
not relieved when an ugly old man, with the lower part of his face all
covered with a stubbly grey beard, rushed out of a dirty den behind it,
and seized me by the hair of my head. He was a dreadful old man to
look at, in a filthy flannel waistcoat, and smelling terribly of rum. His
bedstead, covered with a tumbled and ragged piece of patchwork, was in
the den he had come from, where another little window showed a prospect
of more stinging nettles, and a lame donkey.
    " Oh, what do you want ? " grinned this old man, in a fierce, mono-
tonous whine. " Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want ? Oh, my lungs,
and liver, what do you want ? Oh, goroo, goroo !"
    I was so much dismayed by these words, and particularly by the repe-
tition of the last unknown one, which was a kind of rattle in his throat,
that I could make no answer; hereupon the old man, still holding me by
the hair, repeated :
    " Oh, what do you want ? Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want ?
Oh, my lungs and liver, what do you want ! Oh, goroo !"-which             he
screamed out of himself, with an energy that made his eyes start in his
head.
    " I wanted to know," I said, trembling, " if you would buy a jacket."
    " Oh, let's see the jacket ! " cried the old man. " Oh, my heart on fire,
show the jacket to us ! Oh, my eyes and limbs, bring the jacket out ! "
    With that he took his trembling hands, which were like the claws of a
great bird, out of my hair; and put on a pair of spectacles, not at all
ornamental to his inflamed eyes.
    " Oh, how much for the jacket ?" cried the old man, after examining it.
" Oh-goroo !-how much for the jacket?"
    " Half-a-crown," I answered, recovering myself.
    " Oh, my lungs and liver," cried the old man, " no ! Oh, my eyes, no !
Oh, my limbs, no ! Eighteenpence. Goroo ! "
    Every time he uttered this ejaculation, his eyes seemed to be in danger
of starting out; and every sentence he spoke, he delivered in a sort of
tune, always exactly the same, and more like a gust of wind, which begins
low, mounts up high, and falls again, than any other comparison I can
find for it.
    " Well," said I, glad to have closed the bargain, "I '11 take eighteen-
pence."
    " Oh, my liver !" cried the old man, throwing the jacket on a shelf.

" Get out of the shop !       Oh, my lungs, get out of the shop ! Oh, my
eyes and limbs-goroo !-don't ask for money; make it an exchange."
    I never was so frightened in my life, before or since ; but I told him
humbly that I wanted money, and that nothing else was of any use to me,
but that I would wait for it, as he desired, outside, and had no wish to
hurry him. So I went outside, and sat down in the shade in a corner.
And I sat there so many hours, that the shade became sunlight, and the
sunlight became shade again, and still I sat there waiting for the money.
    There never was such another drunken madman in that line of business,
I hope. That he was well known in the neighbourhood, and enjoyed the
                         OF DAVID COPPERTIELD.                            133
reputation of having sold himself to the devil, I soon understood from
the visits he received from the boys, who continually came skirmishing
about the shop, shouting that legend, and calling to him to bring out his
gold. " You ain't poor, you know, Charley, as you pretend. Bring out
your gold. Bring out some of the gold you sold yourself to the devil for.
Come ! It's in the lining of the mattress, Charley. Rip it open and let 's
have some ! " This, and many offers to lend him a knife for the purpose,
exasperated him to such a degree, that the whole day was a succession of
rushes on his part, and flights on the part of the boys. Sometimes in
his rage he would take me for one of them, and come at me, mouthing as if
he were going to tear me in pieces ; then, remembering me, just in time,
would dive into the shop, and lie upon his bed, as I thought from the
sound of his voice, yelling in a frantic way, to his own windy tune, the
Death of Nelson ; with an Oh ! before every line, and innumerable Goroos
interspersed. As if this were not bad enough for me, the boys, connecting
me with the establishment, on account of the patience and perseverance
with which I sat outside, half-dressed, pelted me, and used me yery ill all day.
    He made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange ; at
one time coming out with a fishing-rod, at another with a fiddle, at another
with a cocked hat, at another with a flute. But I resisted all these
overtures, and sat there in desperation; each time asking him, with tears
in my eyes, for my money or my jacket. At last he began to pay me in
halfpence at a time; and was full two hours getting by easy stages to a
shilling.
    " Oh, my eyes and limbs ! " he then cried, peeping hideously out of the

shop, after a long pause, L C will you go for twopence more?"
    " I can't," I said ; "I shall be starved."
    " Oh, my lungs and liver, will you go for threepence?"
    "I would go for nothing, if I could," I said, " but I want the money
badly ."
    " Oh, go-roo ! " (it is really impossible to express how he twisted this
ejaculation out of himself, as he peeped round the doorpost at me, showing
nothing but his crafty old head) ; "will you go for fourpence ? "
    I was so faint and weary that I closed with this offer; and taking the
money out of his claw, not without trembling, went away more hungry
and thirsty than I had ever been, a little before sunset. But at an
 expense of threepence I soon refreshed myself completely; and, being in
better spirits then, limped seven miles upon my road.
    My bed at night was under another haystack, where I rested comfort-
 ably, after having washed my blistered feet in a stream, and dressed them
 as well as I was able, with some cool leaves. When I took the road again
next morning, I found that it lay through a succession of hop-grounds and
 orchards. I t was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy
 with ripe apples; and in a few places the hop-pickers were already at
 work. I thought it all extremely beautiful, and made up my mind to
 sleep among the hops that night: imagining some cheerful companion-
 ship in the long perspectives of poles, with the graceful leaves twining
 round them.
    The trampers were worse than ever that day, and inspired me with a
 dread that is yet quite fresh in my mind. Some of them were most
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 ferocious-looking ruffians, who stared at me as I went by; and stopped,
 perhaps, and called after me to come back and speak to them ; and when
 I took to my heels, stoned me. I recollect one young fellow-a tinker, I
 suppose, from his wallet and brazier-who had a woman with him, and
 who faced about and stared at me thus ; and then roared to me in such a
 tremendous voice to come back, that I halted and looked round.
     " Come here, when you 're called," said the tinker, " or I '11 rip your
young body open."
    I thought it best to go back. As I drew nearer to them, trying to
propitiate the tinker by my looks, I observed that the woman had a black
 eye.
     " Where are you going? " said the tinker, griping the bosom of my
 shirt with his blackened hand.
     " I am going to Dover," I said.

    "Where do you come from? " asked the tinker, giving his hand
another turn in my shirt, to hold me more securely.
    'I I come from London," I said.

    " What lay are you upon? " asked the tinker. "Are you a prig? "
    " N-no," I said.
    "Ain't you, by G-?       If you make a brag of your honesty to me,"
said the tinker, " I'll knock your brains out."
    With his disengaged hand he made a menace of striking me, and then
looked at me from head to foot.
    "Have you got the price of a pint of beer about you?" said the
tinker. " If you have, out with it, afore I take it away ! "
    I should certainly have produced it, but that I met the woman's look,
and saw her very slightly shake her head, and form "No !" with her
lips.
    "I am very poor," I said, attempting to smile, "and have got no
money ."
    "Why, what do you mean? " said the tinker, looking so sternly at me,
that I almost feared he saw the money in my pocket.
    " Sir ! " I stammered.
    " What do you mean," said the tinker, "by wearing my brother's silk
hankercher ? Give it over here ! " And he had mine off my neck in a
moment, and tossed it to the woman.
    The woman burst into a fit of laughter, as if she thought this a joke,
 and tossing it back to me, nodded once, as slightly as before, and made
the word " Go ! " with her lips. Before I could obey, however, the tinker
 seized the handkerchief out of my hand with a roughness that threw me
away like a feather, and putting it loosely round his own neck, turned
upon the woman with an oath, and knocked her down. I never shall
forget seeing her fall backward on the hard road, and lie there with her
bonnet tumbled off, and her hair all whitened in the dust; nor, when I
looked back from a distance, seeing her sitting on the pathway, which was
a bank by the roadside, wiping the blood from her face with a corner of
her shawl, while he went on ahead.
    This adventure frightened me so, that, afterwards, when I saw any of
these people coming, I turned back until I could find a hiding-place,
where I remained until they had gone out of sight ; which happened so

often, that I was very seriously delayed. But under this difficulty, as
under all the other difficulties of my journey, I seemed to be sustained
and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth, before I
 came into the world. I t always kept me company. I t was there, among
the hops, when I lay down to sleep; it was with me on my waking in
the morning; it went before me all day. I have associated it, ever since,
with the sunny street of Canterbury, dozing as it were in the hot light ;
and with the sight of its old houses and gateways, and the stately, grey
Cathedral, with the rooks sailing round the towers. When I came, a t
last, upon the bare, wide downs near Dover, it relieved the solitary aspect
of the scene with hope; and not until I reached that first great aim of
my journey, and actually set foot in the town itself, on the sixth day of
my flight, did it desert me. But then, strange to say, when I stood with
my ragged shoes, and my dusty, sunburnt, half-clothed figure, in the
place so long desired, it seemed to vanish like a dream, and to leave me
helpless and dispirited.
   I inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first, and received various
answers. One said she lived in the South Foreland Light, and had
singed her whiskers by doing so ; another, that she was made fast to the
great buoy outside the harbor, and could only be visited at half-tide;
a third, that she was locked up in Maidstone Jail for child-stealing; a
fourth, that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind, and
make direct for Calais. The fly-drivers, among whom I inquired next,
were equally jocose and equally disrespectful ; and the shopkeepers, not
liking my appearance, generally replied, without hearing what I had to
say, that they had got nothing for me. I felt more miserable and destitute
than I had done at any period of my running away. My money was all
gone, I had nothing left to dispose of; I was hungry, thirsty, and worn
out ; and seemed as distant from my end as if I had remained in London.
   The morning had worn away in these inquiries, and I was sitting on
the step of an empty shop at a street corner, near the market-place,
deliberating upon wandering towards those other places which had been
mentioned, when a fly-driver, coming by with his carriage, dropped a
horsecloth. Something good-natured in the man's face, as I handed it up,
encouraged me to ask him if he could tell me where Miss Trotwood lived ;
though I had asked the question so often, that it almost died upon my lips.
   "Trotwood," said he. " Let me see. I know the name, too. Old lady ? "
   "Yes," I said, " rather."
   "Pretty stiff in the back? " said he, making himself upright.
   " Yes," I said. " I should think it very likely."
   " Carries a bag ? " said he-" bag with a good deal of room in it-is
gruffish, and comes down upon you, sharp ? "
   My heart sank within me as I acknowledged the undoubted accuracy of
this description.
   "Why then, I tell you what," said he. " If you go up there," pointing
with his whip towards the heights, " and keep right on till you come to
some houses facing the sea, I think you'll hear of her. My opinion is
she won't stand anything, so here's a penny for you."
   I accepted the gift thankfully, and bought a loaf with it. Dispatch-
ing this refreshment by the way, I went in the direction my friend had
136           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 indicated, and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses he
 had mentioned. At length I saw some before me ; and approaching them,
 went into a little shop (it was what we used to call a general shop, at
 home), and inquired if they could have the goodness to tell me where
 Miss Trotwood lived. I addressed myself to a man behind the counter,
 who was weighing some rice for a young woman; but the latter, taking
the inquiry to herself, turned round quickly.
    " My mistress ?"   she said. '' What do you want with her, boy ? "
    " I want," I replied, "to speak to her, if you please."
    "To beg of her, you mean," retorted the damsel.
    "No," I said, "indeed." But suddenly remembering that in truth I
came for no other purpose, I held my peace in confusion, and felt my face
burn.
    My aunt's handmaid, as I supposed she was from what she had said,
put her rice in a little basket and walked out of the shop ; telling me that
I could follow her, if I wanted to know where Miss Trotwood lived.
I needed no second permission ; though I was by this time in such a state
of consternation and agitation, that my legs shook under me. I followed
the young woman, and we soon came to a very neat little cottage with
cheerful bow-windows : in front of it, a small square gravelled court or
garden full of flowers, carefully tended, and smelling deliciously.
    " This is Miss Trotwood's," said the young woman. " Now you know ;
and that's all I have got to say." With which words she hurried into the
house, as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance ; and left me
standing at the garden-gate, looking disconsolately over the top of it
towards the parlor-window, where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the
middle, a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the window-sill, a
small table, and a great chair, suggested to me that my aunt might be
at that moment seated in awful state.
    My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition. The soles had shed
themselves bit by bit, and the upper leathers had broken and burst until
the very shape and form of shoes had departed from them. My hat
(which had served me for a night-cap, too) was so crushed and bent, that
no old battered handle-less saucepan on a dunghill need have been
ashamed to vie with it. My shirt and trowsers, stained with heat, dew,
grass, and the Kentish soil on which I had slept-and torn besides-
might have frightened the birds from my aunt's garden, as I stood at the
gate. My hair had known no comb or brush since I left London. My
face, neck, and hands, from unaccustomed exposure to the air and sun,
were burnt to a berry-brown. From head to foot I was powdered almost
as white with chalk and dust, as if I had come out of a lime-kiln. I n
this plight, and with a strong consciousness of it, I waited to introduce
myself to, and make my first impression on, my formidable aunt.
    The unbroken stillness of the parlor-window leading me to infer, after
a-while, that she was not there, I lifted up my eyes to the window above
it, where I saw a florid, pleasant-looking gentleman, with a grey head,
who shut up one eye in a grotesque manner, nodded his head at me
several times, shook it at me as often, laughed, and went away.
    I had been discomposed enough before ; but I was so much the more
discomposed by this unexpected behaviour, that I was on the point of
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           137
  slinking off, to think how I had best proceed, when there came out of the
 house a lady with a handkerchief tied over her cap, and a pair of gardening
 gloves on her hands, wearing a gardening pocket like a tollman's apron,
 and carrying a great knife. I knew her immediately to be Miss Betsey,
 for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my poor mother had
 so often described her stalking up our garden at Blunderstone Rookery.
      " Go away ! " said Miss Betsey, shaking her head, and making a dis-

 tant chop in the air with her knife. " Go along ! No boys here ! "
     I watched her, with my heart at my lips, as she marched to a corner of
 her garden, and stooped to dig up some little root there. Then, without
 a scrap of courage, but with a great deal of desperation, I went softly in
 and stood beside her, touching her with my finger.
     "If you please, ma'am," I began.
     She started, and looked up.
     " If you please, aunt."

     " EH?" exclaimed Miss Betsey, in a tone of amazement I have never
 heard approached.
     " If you please, aunt, I am your nephew."

     " Oh, Lord ! " said my aunt.    And sat flat down in the garden-path.
     " I am David Copperfield, of Blunderstone, in Suffolk-where            you
 came, on the night when I was born, and saw my dear mama. I have
been very unhappy since she died. I have been slighted, and taught
 nothing, and thrown upon myself, and put to work not fit for me. I t
made me run away to you. I was robbed at first setting out, and have
walked all the way, and have never slept in a bed since I began the
journey." Here my self-support gave way all at once ; and with a move-
ment of my hands, intended to show her my ragged state, and call it to
witness that I had suffered something, I broke into a passion of crying,
 which I suppose had been pent up within me all the week.
     My aunt, with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her
 countenance, sat on the gravel, staring at me, until I began to cry; when
she got up in a great hurry, collared me, and took me into the parlor.
Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press, bring out several
bottles, and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth. I think
they must have been taken out at random, for I am sure I tasted aniseed
water, anchovy sauce, and salad dressing. When she had administered
these restoratives, as I was still quite hysterical, and unable to controul
my sobs, she put me on the sofa, with a shawl under my head, and the
handkerchief from her own head under my feet, lest I should sully the
cover ; and then, sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen I have
already mentioned, so that I could not see her face, ejaculated at intervals,
 " Mercy on us ! " letting those exclamations off like minute guns.

     After a time she rang the bell. "Janet," said my aunt, when her
servant came in. " Go up stairs, give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and
 say I wish to speak to him."
     Janet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the sofa (I was
 afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt), but went on her
errand. My aunt, with her hands behind her, walked up and down the
room, until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper window
came in laughing.
138            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   " Mr. Dick," said my aunt, " don't be a fool, because nobody can be
more discreet than you can, when you choose. We all know that. So
don't be a fool, whatever you are."
   The gentleman was serious immediately, and looked at me, I thought,
as if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window.
   " Mr. Dick," said my aunt, " you have heard me mention David Copper-

field? Now don't pretend not to have a memory, because you and I
know better."
   "David Copperfield?" said Mr. Dick, who did not appear to me to
remember much about it. "David Copperfield? Oh yes, to be sure.
David, certainly."
   "Well," said my aunt, "this is his boy-his son. He would be as
like his father as it's possible to be, if he was not so like his mother, too."
   " His son ? " said Mr. Dick.      " David's son ? Indeed ! "
   " Yes," pursued my aunt, " and he has done a pretty piece of business.

He has run away. Ah ! His sister, Betsey Trotwood, never would have
run away." My aunt shook her head firmly, confident in the character
and behaviour of the girl who never was born.
   " Oh ! you think she wouldn't have run away? " said Mr. Dick.
   "Bless and save the man," exclaimed my aunt, sharply, "how he
talks! Don't I know she wouldn't? She would have lived with her
god-mother, and we should have been devoted to one another. Where,
in the name of wonder, should his sister, Betsey Trotwood, have run from,
or t o ? "
   "Nowhere," said Mr. Dick.
   " Well then," returned my aunt, softened by the reply, "how can you

pretend to be wool-gathering, Dick, when you are as sharp as a surgeon's
lancet? Now, here you see young David Copperfield, and the question I
put to you is, what shall I do with him ? "
   " What shall you do with him ? " said Mr. Dick, feebly, scratching his
head. " Oh ! do with him ? "
   "Yes," said my aunt, with a grave look and her forefinger held up.
" Come ! I want some very sound advice.''

   " Why, if I was you," said Mr. Dick, considering, and lookingvacantly
at me, "1 should-"        The contemplation of me seemed to inspire him
with a sudden idea, and he added, briskly, "I should wash him !"
   " Janet," said my aunt, turning round with a quiet triumph, which I
did not then understand, " Mr. Dick sets us all right. Heat the bath ! "
   Although I was deeply interested in this dialogue, I could not help
observing my aunt, Mr. Dick, and Janet, while it was in progress, and
completing a survey I had already been engaged in making of the room.
   My aunt was a tall, hard-featured lady, but by no means ill-looking.
There was an inflexibility in her face, in her voice, in her gait and car-
riage, amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon a
gentle creature like my mother; but her features were rather handsome
than otherwise, though unbending and austere. I particularly noticed
that she had a very quick, bright eye. Her hair, which was grey, was
arranged in two plain divisions, under what I believe would be called a
mob-cap : I mean a cap, much more common then than now, with side-
pieces fastening under the chin. Her dress was of a lavender color, and
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                             139
  perfectly neat; but scantily made, as if she desired to be as little encum-
  bered as possible. I remember that I thought it, in form, more like a
 riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off, than anything else. She
  wore at her side a gentleman's gold watch, if I might judge from its size
 and make, with an appropriate chain and seals ; she had some linen at her
 throat not unlike a shirt-collar, and things at her wrists like little shirt-
 wristbands.
    Mr. Dick, as I have already said, was grey-headed, and florid : I should
 have said all about him, in saying so, had not his head been curiously
 bowed-not by age; it reminded me of one of Mr. Creakle's boys' heads
 after a beating-and his grey eyes prominent and large, with a strange
 kind of watery brightness in them that made me, in combination with his
 vacant manner, his submission to my aunt, and his childish delight when
 she praised him, suspect him of being a little mad ; though, if he were
 mad, how he came to be there puzzled me extremely. H e was dressed
 like any other ordinary gentleman, in a loose grey morning coat and waist-
 coat, and white trowsers; and had his watch in his fob, and his money in
 his pockets : which he rattled as if he were very proud of it.
    Janet was a pretty blooming girl, of about nineteen or twenty,
 and a perfect picture of neatness. Though I made no further obser-
 vation of her at the moment, I may mention here what I did not
 discover until afterwards, namely, that she was one of a series of prot6g6es
 whom my aunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in a
 renouncement of mankind, and who had generally completed their abjura-
tion by marrying the baker.
    The room was as neat as Janet or my aunt. As I laid down my pen,
 a moment since, to think of it, the air from the sea came blowing in
 again, mixed with the perfume of the flowers ; and I saw the old-fashioned
furniture brightly rubbed and polished, my aunt's inviolable chair and
table by the round green fan in the bow-window, the drugget-covered
carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two canaries, the old china, the punch-
bowl full of dried rose leaves, the tall press guarding all sorts of bottles and
pots, and, wonderfully out of keeping with the rest, my dusty self upon
the sofa, taking note of everything.
    Janet had gone away to get the bath ready, when my aunt, to my great
alarm, became in one moment rigid with indignation, and had hardly voice
to cry out, '< Janet ! Donkies ! "
    Upon which, Janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in
flames, darted out on a little piece of green in front, and warned off two
saddle-donkeys, lady-ridden, that had presumed to set hoof upon i t ;
while my aunt, rushing out of the house, seized the bridle of a third
animal laden with a bestriding child, turned him, led him forth from
those sacred precincts, and boxed the ears of the unlucky urchin in
attendance who had dared to profane that hallowed ground.
    To this hour I don't know whether my aunt had any lawful right of way
over that patch of green; but she had settled it in her own mind that
she had, and it was all the same to her. The one great outrage of her life,
demanding to be constantly avenged, was the passage of a donkey over that
immaculate spot. I n whatever occupation she was engaged, however
interesting to her the conversation in which she was taking part, a donkey
140           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

turned the current of her ideas in a moment, and she was upon him straight.
Jugs of water, and watering pots, were kept in secret places ready to be
discharged on the offending boys ; sticks were laid in ambush behind the
door; sallies were made at all hours; and incessant war prevailed.
Perhaps this was an agreeable excitement to the donkey-boys ; or perhaps
the more sagacious of the donkeys, understanding how the case stood,
delighted with constitutional obstinacy in coming that way. I only
know that there were three alarms before the bath was ready; and that
on the occasion of the last and most desperate of all, I saw my aunt
engage, single-handed, with a sandy-headed lad of fifteen, and bump his
sandy head against her own gate, before he seemed to comprehend
what was the matter. These interruptions were the more ridiculous to
me, because she was giving me broth out of a table-spoon at the time
(having firmly persuaded herself that I was actually starving, and must
receive nourishment at first in very small quantities), and, while my mouth
was yet open to receive the spoon, she would put it back into the basin,
cry " Janet ! Donkies ! " and go out to the assault.
   The bath was a great comfort. For I began to be sensible of acute
pains in my limbs from lying out in the fields, and was now so tired and
low that I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together.
When I had bathed, they (I mean my aunt and Janet) enrobed me in a
shirt and a pair of trowsers belonging to Mr. Dick, and tied me up in two
or three great shawls. What sort of bundle I looked like, I don't know,
but I felt a very hot one. Feeling also very faint and drowsy, I soon lay
down on the sofa again and fell asleep.
   It might have been a dream, originating in the fancy which had occu-
pied my mind so long, but I awoke with the impression that my aunt
had come and bent over me, and had put my hair away from my face, and
laid my head more comfortably, and had then stood looking at me. The
words, "Pretty fellow," or " Poor fellow," seemed to be in my ears, too ;
but certainly there was nothing else, when I awoke, to lead me to believe
that they had been uttered by my aunt, who sat in the bow-window
gazing at the sea from behind the green fan, which was mounted on a
kind of swivel, and turned any way.
   We dined soon after I awoke, off a roast fowl and a pudding ; I sitting
at table, not unlike a trussed bird myself, and moving my arms with con-
siderable difficulty. But as my aunt had swathed me up, I made no
complaint of being inconvenienced. All this time, I was deeply anxious
to know what she was going to do with me; but she took her dinner in
profound silence, except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting
opposite, and said, " Mercy upon us! " which did not by any means
relieve my anxiety.
   The cloth being drawn, and some sherry put upon the table (of which I
had a glass), my aunt sent up for Mr. Dick again, who joined us, and
looked as wise as he could when she requested him to attend to my story,
which she elicited from me, gradually, by a course of questions. During
my recital, she kept her eyes on Mr. Dick, who I thought would have
 gone to sleep but for that, and who, whensoever he lapsed into a smile,
was checked by a frown from my aunt.
   "Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate Baby, that she must go
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          141
 and be married again," said my aunt, when I had finished, I can't
 conceive."
    "Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband," Mr. Dick sug-
 gested.
    "Fell in love!" repeated my aunt, "What do you mean? What
business had she to do it ? "
    " Perhaps," Mr. Dick simpered, after thinking a little, " she did it for
pleasure."
    " Pleasure, indeed !" replied my aunt. " A mighty pleasure for the
poor baby to fix her simple faith upon any dog of a fellow, certain to ill-
use her in some way or other. What did she propose to herself, I should
like to know ! She had had one husband. She had seen David Copper-
field out of the world, who was always running after wax dolls from his
cradle. She had got a baby-oh, there were a pair of babies when she
gave birth to this child sitting here, that Friday night !-and what more
did she want ? "
    Mr. Dick secretly shook his head at me, as if he thought there was no
getting over this.
    "She couldn't even have a baby like anybody else," said my aunt,
 "Where was this child's sister, Betsey Trotwood! Not forthcoming.
Don't tell me ! "
    Mr. Dick seemed quite frightened.
    "That little man of a doctor, with his head on one side," said my aunt,
" Jellips, or whatever his name was, what was he about? All he could do,
was to say to me, like a robin redbreast-as he is-' It's a boy.' A boy !
Yah, the imbecility of the whole set of 'em ! "
    The heartiness of the ejaculation startled Mr. Dick exceedingly ; and me,
too, if I am to tell the truth.
    "And then, as if this was not enough, and she had not stood sufficiently
in the light of this child's sister, Betsey Trotwood," said my aunt, " she
marries a second time-goes and marries a Murderer-or a man with a
name like it-and stands in this child's light! And the natural consequence
is, as anybody but a baby might have foreseen, that he prowls and wanders.
He's as like Cain before he was grown up, as he can be."
    Mr. Dick looked hard at me, as if to identify me in this character.
    "And then there's that woman with the Pagan name," said my aunt,
"that Peggotty, she goes and gets married next. Because she has not
seen enough of the evil attending such things, she goes and gets married
next, as the child relates. I only hope," said my aunt, shaking her head,
"that her husband is one of those Poker husbands who abound in the
newspapers, and will beat her well with one."
    I could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried, and made the subject
of such a wish. I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken. That
Peggotty was the best, the truest, the most faithful, most devoted, and
most self-denying friend and servant in the world; who had ever loved
me dearly, who had ever loved my mother dearly; who had held my
mother's dying head upon her arm, on whose face my mother had im-
printed her last grateful kiss. And my remembrance of them both,
choking me, I broke down as I was trying to say that her home
was my home, and that all she had was mine, and that I would have
142            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

gone to her for shelter, but for her humble station, which made
me fear that I might bring some trouble on her-I              broke down, I
say, as I was trying to say so, and laid my face in my hands upon
the table.
    " Well, well ! " said my aunt, " the child is right to stand by those who

have stood by him-Janet ! Donkies ! "
   I thoroughly believe that but for those unfortunate donkies, we should
have come to a good understanding; for my aunt had laid her hand
on my shoulder, and the impulse was upon me, thus emboldened,
to embrace her and beseech her protection. But the interruption, and the
disorder she was thrown into by the struggle outside, put an end to all
softer ideas for the present ; and kept my aunt indignantly declaiming to
Mr. Dick about her determination to appeal for redress to the laws of her
country, and to bring actions for trespass against the whole donkey pro-
prietorship of Dover, until tea-time.
   After tea, we sat at the window-on the look-out, as I imagined, from
my aunt's sharp expression of face, for more invaders-until dusk, when
Janet set candles, and a backgammon-board, on the table, and pulled
down the blinds.
   "Now, Mr. Dick," said my aunt, with her grave look, and her fore-
finger up as before, " I am going to ask you another question. Look at
this child."
   "David's son? " said Mr. Dick, with an attentive, puzzled face.
    " Exactly so," returned my aunt. "What would you do with him, now ?"
   " Do with David's son ?" said Mr. Dick.
   " Ay," replied my aunt, "with David's son."
   "Oh!" said Mr. Dick. "Yes. Do with-I                   should put him to
bed."
    " Janet !" cried my aunt, with the same complacent triumph that I had
remarked before. " Mr. Dick sets us all right. If the bed is ready, we 1' 1
take him up to it."
    Janet reporting it to be quite ready, I was taken up to it; kindly, but
in some sort like a prisoner; my aunt going in front and Janet bring-
ing up the rear. The only circumstance which gave me any new hope,
was my aunt's stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that
was prevalent there ; and Janet's replying that she had been making tinder
down in the kitchen, of my old shirt. But there were no other clothes
in my room than the odd heap of things I wore ; and when I was left
there, with a little taper which my aunt forewarned me would burn
exactly five minutes, I heard them lock my door on the outside. Turning
these things over in my mind, I deemed it possible that my aunt, who
 could know nothing of me, might suspect I had a habit of running away,
and took precautions, on that account, to have me in safe keeping.
    The room was a pleasant one, at the top of the house, overlooking the
sea, on which the moon was shining brilliantly. After I had said my
prayers, and the candle had burnt out, Iremember how I still sat looking
at the moonlight on the water, as if I could hope to read my fortune in
it, as in a bright book; or to see my mother with her child, coming from
Heaven, along that shining path, to look upon me as she had looked
 when I last saw her sweet face. I remember how the solemn feeling
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

with which at length I turned my eyes away, yielded to the sensation of
gratitude and rest which the sight of the white-curtained bed-and how
much more the lying softly down upon it, nestling in the snow-white
sheets !-inspired.  I remember how I thought of all the solitary places
under the night sky where I had slept, and how I prayed that I never
might be houseless any more, and never might forget the houseless.
I remember how I seemed to float, then, down the melancholy glory of
that track upon the sea, away into the world of dreams.




                              CHAPTER XIV.
               MY AUNT MAKES UP HER MIND ABOUT ME.

   ON going down in the morning, I found my aunt musing so profoundly
over the breakfast-table, with her elbow on the tray, that the contents of
the urn had overflowed the teapot and were laying the whole table-cloth
under water, when my entrance put her meditations to flight. I felt sure
that I had been the subject of her reflections, and was more than ever
anxious to know her intentions towards me. Yet I dared not express my
anxiety, lest it should give her offence.
   My eyes, however, not being so much under controul as my tongue,
were attracted towards my aunt very often during breakfast. I never
could look at her for a few moments together but I found her looking at
me-in an odd thoughtful manner, as if I were an immense way off,
instead of being on the other side of the small round table. When she
had finished her breakfast, my aunt very deliberately leaned back in her
chair, knitted her brows, folded her arms, and contemplated me at her
leisure, with such a fixedness of attention that I was quite overpowered
by embarrassment. Not having as yet finished my own breakfast, I
attempted to hide my confusion by proceeding with i t ; but my knife
tumbled over my fork, my fork tripped up my knife, I chipped bits of
bacon a surprising height into the air instead of cutting them for my own
eating, and choked myself with my tea which persisted in going the wrong
way instead of the right one, until I gave in altogether, and sat blushing
under my aunt's close scrutiny.
   " Hal10 ! " said my aunt, after a long time.
   I looked up, and met her sharp bright glance respectfully.
   "I have written to him," said my aunt.
   '6 To -? "

   " To your father-in-law," said my aunt.        " I have sent him a letter
that I 1' 1 trouble him to attend to, or he and I will fall out, I can tell him ! "
   " Does he know where I am, aunt? " I inquired, alarmed.
    " I have told him," said my aunt, with a nod.
    " Shall I-be-given      up to him? " I faltered.
    " I don't know," said my aunt. "We shall see."
    "Oh! I can't think what I shall do," I exclaimed, "if I have to go
back to Mr. Murdstone ! "
144            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   '< I don't know anything about it," said my aunt, shaking her head.
" I can't say, I am sure. We shall see."
    My spirits sank under these words, and I became very downcast and
 heavy of heart. My aunt, without appearing to take much heed of me,
 put on a coarse apron with a bib, which she took out of the press ; washed
 up the teacups with her own hands; and, when everything was washed
 and set in the tray again, and the cloth folded and put on the top of
 the whole, rang for Janet to remove it. She next swept up the
 crumbs with a little broom (putting on a pair of gloves first), until
 there did not appear to be one microscopic speck left on the carpet; next
 dusted and arranged the room, which was dusted and arranged to a hair's
 breadth already. When all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction,
 she took off the gloves and apron, folded them up, put them in the parti-
 cular corner of the press from which they had been taken, brought out
 her work-box to her own table in the open window, and sat down, with
 the green fan between her and the light, to work.
   " I wish you'd go up stairs," said my aunt, as she threaded her needle,
 "and give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and I'll be glad to know how
he gets on with his Memorial."
   I rose with all alacrity, to acquit myself of this commission.
   " I suppose," said my aunt, eyeing me as narrowly as she had eyed

the needle in threading it, " you think Mr. Dick a short name, eh ? "
    " I thought it was rather a short name, yesterday," I confessed.

    " You are not to suppose that he hasn't got a longer name, if he chose
to use it," said my aunt, with a loftier air. "Babley-Mr. Richard
Babley-that 's the gentleman's true name."
   I was going to suggest, with a modest sense of my youth and the
familiarity I had been already guilty of, that I had better give him the
full benefit of that name, when my aunt went on to say:
   " But don't you call him by it, whatever you do.        H e can't bear his
name. That's a peculiarity of his. Though I don't know that it's
much of a peculiarity, either ; for he has been ill-used enough, by some that
bear it, to have a mortal antipathy for it, Heaven knows. Mr. Dick is his
name here, and everywhere else, now-if he ever went anywhere else, which
he don't. So take care, child, you don't call him anything 621t Mr. Dick."
   I promised to obey, and went up-stairs with my message ; thinking, as I
went, that if Mr. Dick had been working at his Memorial long, at the
same rate as I had seen him working at it, through the open door, when
I came down, he was probably getting on very well indeed. I found him
still driving at it with a long pen, and his head almost laid upon the
paper. He was so intent upon it, that I had ample leisure to observe the
large paper kite in a corner, the confusion of bundles of manuscript, the
number of pens, and, above all, the quantity of ink (which he seemed to have
in, in half-gallon jars by the dozen), before he observed my being present.
   " Ha ! Phcebus ! " said Mr. Dick, laying down his pen.         " How does
the world go ! I '11 tell you what," he added, in a lower tone, " I
shouldn't wish it to be mentioned, but it's a-"         here he beckoned to
me, and put his lips close to my ear-" it's a mad world. Mad as
Bedlam, boy ! " said Mr. Dick, taking snuff from a round box on the
table, and laughing heartily.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    Without presuming to give my opinion on this question, I delivered
 my message.
    " Well," said Mr. Dick, in answer, " my compliments to her, and I-
 I believe I have made a start. I think I have made a start," said Mr.
 Dick, passing his hand among his grey hair, and casting anything but a
 confident look at his manuscript. "You have been to school? "
    "Yes, sir," I answered ; " for a short time."
    "Do you recollect the date," said Mr. Dick, looking earnestly at me,
 and taking up his pen to note it down, "when King Charles the First had
 his head cut off? "
    I said I believed it happened in the year sixteen hundred and forty-nine.
    "Well," returned Mr. Dick, scratching his ear with his pen, and looking
 dubiously at me. " So the books say ; but I don't see how that can be.
Because, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made
that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head, after it was
 taken off, into mine ? "
    I was very much surprised by the inquiry; but could give no informa-
tion on this point.
    "It's very strange," said Mr. Dick, with a despondent look upon his
papers, and with his hand among his hair again, " that I never can get that
quite right. I never can make that perfectly clear. But no matter, no
matter ! " he said cheerfully, and rousing himself, " there 's time enough !
My compliments to Miss Trotwood, I am getting on very well indeed."
    I was going away, when he directed my attention to the kite.
    " What do you think of that for a kite ? " he said.
    I answered that it was a beautiful one. I should think it must have
been as much as seven feet high.
    " I made it. We'll go and fly it, you and I," said Mr. Dick. " Do
you see this ? "
    He showed me that it was covered with manuscript, very closely and
laboriously written ; but so plainly, that as I looked along the lines, I
thought I saw some allusion to King Charles the First's head again, in
one or two places.
    " There's plenty of string," said Mr. Dick, " and when it flies high,
i t takes the facts a long way. That's my manner of diffusing 'em.
I don't know where they may come down. It's according to circum-
stances, and the wind, and so forth; but I take my chance of that."
    His face was so very mild and pleasant, and had something so reverend
in it, though it was hale and hearty, that I was not sure but that he was
having a good-humoured jest with me. So I laughed, and he laughed,
and we parted the best friends possible.
    "Well, child," said my aunt, when I went down stairs. "And what of
Mr. Dick, this morning ? "
    I informed her that he sent his compliments, and was getting on very
well indeed.
    "What do you think of him ? " said my aunt.
    I had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question, by
replying that I thought him a very nice gentleman ; but my aunt was not
to be so put off, for she laid her work down in her lap, and said, folding
her hands upon it :
                                                               L
146           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Come ! Your sister Betsey Trotwood would have told me what she
thought of any one, directly. Be as like your sister as you can, and
speak out !"
    " Is he-is Mr. Dick-I ask because I don't know, aunt-is he at all out
of his mind, then ? " I stammered ; for I felt I was on dangerous ground.
    "Not a morsel," said my aunt.
    "Oh, indeed! " I observed faintly.
    "If there is anything in the world," said my aunt, with great decision
and force of manner, " that Mr. Dick is not, it's that."
    I had nothing better to offer, than another timid " Oh, indeed! "
    " H e has been called mad," said my aunt. " I have a selfish pleasure
in saying he has been called mad, or I should not have had the benefit of
his society and advice for these last ten years and upwards-in fact, ever
 since your sister, Betsey Trotwood, disappointed me."
    " So long as that ? " I said.

    "And nice people they were, who had the audacity to call him mad,"
pursued my aunt. " Mr. Dick is a sort of distant connexion of mine-it
doesn't matter how; I needn't enter into that. If it hadn't been for
me, his own brother would have shut him up for life. That's all."
    I am afraid it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt
strongly on the subject, I tried to look as if I felt strongly too.
    " A proud fool! " said my aunt. "Because his brother was a little
eccentric-though he is not half so eccentric as a good many people-he
didn't like to have him visible about his house, and sent him away t o
some private asylum-place; though he had been left to his particular care
by their deceased father, who thought him almost a natural. And a wise
man he must have been to think so ! Mad himself, no doubt."
    Again, as my aunt looked quite convinced, I endeavoured to look quite
 convinced also.
    " So I stepped in," said my aunt, "and made him an offer. I said,
Your brother's sane-a great deal more sane than you are, or ever will
be, it is to be hoped. Let him have his little income, and come and
live with me. I am not afraid of him, I am not proud, I a m ready to
take care of him, and shall not ill-treat him as some people (besides the
asylum folks) have done. After a good deal of squabbling," said my
aunt, "I got him; and he has been here ever since. He is the most
friendly and amenable creature in existence ; and as for advice !-But
nobody knows what that man's mind is, except myself."
    My aunt smoothed her dress and shook her head, as if she smoothed
 defiance of the whole world out of the one, and shook it out of the other.
     " He had a favorite sister," said my aunt, " a good creature, and very
 kind to him. But she did what they all do-took a husband. And he
 did what they all do-made her wretched. I t had such an effect upon the
 mind of Mr. Dick (that's not madness I hope !) that, combined with his
fear of his brother, and his sense of his unkindness, it threw him into
 a fever. That was before he came to me, but the recollection of it is oppress-
ive to him even now. Did he say anything to you about King Charles
the First, child ? "
    "Yes, aunt."
     " Ah ! " said my aunt, rubbing her nose as if she were a little vexed.
 " That's his allegorical way of expressing it.       He connects his illness
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

with great disturbance and agitation, naturally, and that's the figure,
or the simile, or whatever it's called, which he chooses to use. And why
shouldn't he, if he thinks proper ! "
   I said : " Certainly, aunt."
   " It's not a business-like way of speaking," said my aunt, "nor a
worldly way. I am aware of that; and that's the reason why I insist
upon it, that there shan't be a word about it in his Memorial."
   " I s it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing, aunt? "
   "Yes, child," said my aunt, rubbing her nose again. "He is memo-
rialising the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord Somebody or other-one of
those people, at all events, who are paid to be memorialised-about his
affairs. I suppose it will go in, one of these days. He hasn't been able
to draw it up yet, without introducing that mode of expressing himself;
but it don't signify; it keeps him employed."
   I n fact, I found out afterwards that Mr. Dick had been for upwards of
ten years endeavouring to keep King Charles the First out of the Memorial;
but he had been constantly getting into it, and was there now.
   " I say again," said my aunt, " nobody knows what that man's mind is
except myself; and he 's the most amenable and friendly creature in exist-
ence. If he likes to fly a kite sometimes, what of that ! Franklin used to
fly a kite. He was a Quaker, or something of that sort, if I am not mis-
taken. And a Quaker flying a kite is a much more ridiculous object than
anybody else."
   I f I could have supposed that my aunt had recounted these particulars
for my especial behoof, and as a piece of confidence in me, I should have
felt very much distinguished, and should have augured favourably from
such a mark of her good opinion. But I could hardly help observing
that she had launched into them, chiefly because the question was raised
in her own mind, and with very little reference to me, though she had
addressed herself to me in the absence of anybody else.
   At the same time, I must say that the generosity of her championship
of poor harmless Mr. Dick, not only inspired my young breast with some
selfish hope for myself, but warmed it unselfishly towards her. I believe
that I began to know that there was something about my aunt, notwith-
standing her many eccentricities and odd humours, to be honored and
trusted in. Though she was just as sharp that day, as on the day before,
and was in and out about the donkeys just as often, and was thrown into
a tremendous state of indignation, when a young man, going by, ogled
Janet at a window (which was one of the gravest misdemeanors that
could be committed against my aunt's dignity), she seemed to me to
command more of my respect, if not less of my fear.
   The anxiety I underwent, in the interval which necessarily elapsed
before a reply could be received to her letter to Mr. Murdstone, was
extreme ; but I made an endeavour to suppress it, and to be as agreeable
as I could in a quiet way, both to my aunt and Mr. Dick. The latter and
I would have gone out to fly the great kite; but that I had still no other
clothes than the anything but ornamental garments with which I had been
decorated on the iirst day, and which confined me to the house, except for
an hour after dark, when my aunt, for my health's sake, paraded me up
and down on the cliff outside, before going to bed. At length the reply
from Mr. Murdstone came, and my aunt informed me, to my infinite

terror, that he was coming to speak to her himself on the next day. On
the next day, still bundled up in my curious habiliments, I sat counting
the time, flushed and heated by the conflict of sinking hopes and rising
fears within me; and waiting to be startled by the sight of the gloomy
face, whose non-arrival startled me every minute.
   My aunt was a little more imperious and stern than usual, but I
observed no other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so
much dreaded by me. She sat at work in the window, and I sat by, with
my thoughts running astray on all possible and impossible results of
Mr. Murdstone's visit, until pretty late in the afternoon. Our dinner had
been indefinitely postponed; but it was growing so late, that my aunt had
ordered it to be got ready, when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys, and
to my consternation and amazement, I beheld Miss Murdstone, on a side-
saddle, ride deliberately over the sacred piece of green, and stop in front of
the house, looking about her.
   " Go along with you ! " cried my aunt, shaking her head and her fist at
the window. " You have no business there. How dare you trespass ?
Go along ! Oh, you bold-faced thing ! "
   My aunt was so exasperated by the coolness with which Miss Mnrd-
stone looked about her, that I really believe she was motionless, and
unable for the moment to dart out according to custom. I seized the
opportunity to inform her who it was ; and that the gentleman now com-
ing near the offender (for the way up was very steep, and he had dropped
behind), was Mr. Murdstone himself.
   " I don't care who it is ! " cried my aunt, still shaking her head, and
gesticulating anything but welcome from the bow-window. " I won't be
trespassed upon. I won't allow it. Go away ! Janet, turn him round.
Lead him off! " and I saw, from behind my aunt, a sort of hurried battle-
piece, in which the donkey stood resisting everybody, with all his four legs
planted different ways, while Janet tried to pull him round by the
bridle, Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on, Miss Murdstone struck at
Janet with a parasol, and several boys, who had come to see the engage-
ment, shouted vigorously. But my aunt, suddenly descrying among them
the young malefactor who was the donkey's guardian, and who was one
of the most inveterate offenders against her, though hardly in his teens,
rushed out to the scene of action, pounced upon him, captured him,
dragged him, with his jacket over his head, and his heels grinding the
ground, into the garden, and, calling upon Janet to fetch the constables
and justices that he might be taken, tried, and executed on the spot, held
him at bay there. This part of the business, however, did not last long ; for
the young rascal, being expert at a variety of feints and dodges, of which
 my aunt had no conception, soon went whooping away, leaving some deep
impressions of his nailed boots in the flower-beds, and taking his donkey
in triumph with him.
   Miss Murdstone, during the latter portion of the contest, had dismounted,
and was now waiting with her brother at the bottom of the steps, until
my aunt should be at leisure to receive them. My aunt, a little ruffled
by the combat, marched past them into the house, with great dignity, and
took no notice of their presence, until they were announced by Janet.
   " Shall I go away, aunt ? " I asked, trembling.
   " NO, sir," said my aunt. " Certainly not ! " With which she pushed

me into a corner near her, and fenced me in with a chair, as if it were a
prison or a bar of justice. This position I continued to occupy during
the whole interview, and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone
 enter the room.
    " Oh ! " said my aunt, " I was not aware at first to whom I had the
pleasure of objecting. But I don't allow anybody to ride over that turf. I
make no exceptions. I don't allow anybody to do it."
   " Your regulation is rather awkward to strangers," said Miss Murdstone.

   " I s it ! " said my aunt.
   Mr. Murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities, and interposing
began :
    " Miss Trotwood ! "

   " I beg your pardon," observed my aunt with a keen look. " You are the
Mr. Murdstone who married the widow of my late nephew, David Copper-
field, of Blunderstone Rookery ?-Though why Rookery, I don't know !"
   " I am," said Mr. Murdstone.
   " You'll excuse my saying, sir,"     returned my aunt, " that I think it
would have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that
poor child alone."
   " I so far agree with what Miss Trotwood has remarked," observed

Miss Murdstone, bridling, "that I consider our lamented Clara to have
been, in all essential respects, a mere child."
   " I t is a comfort to you and me, ma'am," said my aunt, "who are
getting on in life, and are not likely to be made unhappy by our personal
attractions, that nobody can say the same of us."
   " No doubt ! " returned Miss Murdstone, though, I thought, not with

a very ready or gracious assent. "And it certainly might have been, as
you say, a better and happier thing for my brother if he had never entered
into such a marriage. I have always been of that opinion."
   " I have no doubt you have," said my aunt. " Janet," ringing the bell,
" my compliments to Mr. Dick, and beg him to come down."
   Until he came, my aunt sat perfectly upright and stiff, frowning at the
wall. When he came, my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction.
   " Mr. Dick.      An old and intimate friend. On whose judgment," said
my aunt, with emphasis, as an admonition to Mr. Dick, who was biting
his forefinger and looking rather foolish, " I rely."
   Mr. Dick took his finger out of his mouth, on this hint, and stood
among the group, with a grave and attentive expression of face. My aunt
inclined her head to Mr. Murdstone, who went on :
   " Miss Trotwood : on the receipt of your letter, I considered it an act

of greater justice to myself, and perhaps of more respect to you-"
   "Thank you," said my aunt, still eyeing him keenly. "You needn't
mind me."
   "To answer it in person, however inconvenient the journey," pursued
Mr. Murdstone, "rather than by letter. This unhappy boy who has run
away from his friends and his occupation-"
   " And whose appearance," interposed his sister, directing general atten-

tion to me in my indefinable costume, "is perfectly scandalous and
disgraceful."
   "Jane Murdstone," said her brother, " have the goodness not to
interrupt me. This unhappy boy, Miss Trotwood, has been the occasion
 150            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  of much domestic trouble and uneasiness ; both during the lifetime of my
  late dear wife, and since. He has a sullen, rebellious spirit; a violent
  temper; and an untoward, intractable disposition. Both my sister and
  myself have endeavoured to correct his vices, but ineffectually. And I have
  felt-we both have felt, I may say; my sister being fully in my confi-
  dence-that it is right you should receive this grave and dispassionate
 assurance from our lips."
      " I t can hardly be necessary for me to confirm anything stated by my

 brother," said Miss Murdstone; "but I beg to observe, that, of all the
 boys in the world, I believe this is the worst boy."
      " Strong !" said my aunt, shortly.
      " But not at all too strong for the facts," returned Miss Murdstone.
      " H a !" said my aunt. " Well, sir ?"
      " I have my own opinions," resumed Mr. Murdstone, whose face

 darkened more and more, the more he and my aunt observed each other,
 which they did very narrowly, " as to the best mode of bringing him up ;
 they are founded, in part, on my knowledge of him, and in part on my
 knowledge of my own means and resources. I am responsible for them
 to myself, I act upon them, and I say no more about them. I t is enough
that I place this boy under the eye of a friend of my own, in a respect-
 able business ; that it does not please him; that he runs away from i t ;
 makes himself a common vagabond about the country; and comes here,
 in rags, to appeal to you, Miss Trotwood. I wish to set before you,
 honorably, the exact consequences-so far as they are within my know-
 ledge-of your abetting him in this appeal."
      " But about the respectable business first," said my aunt.    " If he had
 been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose ?"
      " If he had been my brother's own boy," returned Miss Murdstone,
 striking in, " his character, I trust, would have been altogether different."
      " Or if the poor child, his mother, had been alive, he would still have
 gone into the respectable business, would he?" said my aunt.
      " I believe,"   said Mr. Murdstone, with an inclination of his head,
 " that Clara would have disputed nothing, which myself and my sister
Jane Murdstone were agreed was for the best."
     Miss Murdstone confirmed this, with an audible murmur.
     " Humph ! " said my aunt.      " Unfortunate baby !"
    Mr. Dick, who had been rattling his money all this time, was rattling
it so loudly now, that my aunt felt it necessary to check him with a look,
before saying :
     " The poor child's annuity died with her ? "
     " Died with her," replied Mr. Murdstone.

     "And there was no settlement of the little property-the house and garden
-the what 's-its-name Rookery without any rooks in it-upon her boy? "
     " I t had been left to her, unconditionally, by her first husband,"
Mr. Murdstone began, when my aunt caught him up with the greatest
irascibility and impatience.
    ' I Good Lord, man, there 's no occasion to say that.   Left to her uncon-
ditionally ! I think I see David Copperfield looking forward to any con-
dition of any sort or kind, though it stared him point-blank in the face !
Of course it was left to her unconditionally. But when she married
again-when she took that most disastrous step of marrying you, in

 short," said my aunt, "to be plain-did no one put in a word for the boy
 at that time ? "
    " My late wife loved her second husband, madam," said Mr. Murdstone,

 "and trusted implicitly in him."
    "Your late wife, sir, was a most unworldly, most unhappy, most unfor-
 tunate baby," returned my aunt, shaking her head at him. " That's
 what she was. And now, what have you got to say next? "
    "Merely this, Miss Trotwood," he returned. " I am here to take
David back-to take him back unconditionally, to dispose of him as I
think proper, and to deal with him as I think right. I am not here to
make any promise, or give any pledge to anybody. You may possibly
have some idea, Miss Trotwood, of abetting him in his running away, and
in his complaints to you. Your manner, which I must say does not seem
intended to propitiate, induces me to think it possible. Now I must
caution you that if you abet him once, you abet him for good and all; if
you step in between him and me, now, you must step in, Miss Trotwood,
for ever. I cannot trifle, or be trifled with. I am here, for the first and
last time, to take him away. I s he ready to go ? If he is not-and you
tell me he is not; on any pretence; it is indifferent to me what-my
doors are shut
        -     .. against him henceforth, and yours, I take it for granted, are

open to him."
    To this address, my aunt had listened with the closest attention, sitting
perfectly upright, with her hands folded on one knee, and looking grimly
on the speaker. When he had finished, she turned her eyes so as to com-
mand Miss Murdstone, without otherwise disturbing her attitude, and said :
    " Well, ma'am, have you got anything to remark? "
    " Indeed, Miss Trotwood," said Miss Murdstone, " all that I could
say has been so well said by my brother, and all that I know to be the
fact has been so plainly stated by him, that I have nothing to add except
my thanks for your politeness. For your very great politeness, I am
sure," said Miss Murdstone ; with an irony which no more affected my
aunt, than it discomposed the cannon I had slept by at Chatham.
    "And what does the boy say ? " said my aunt. " Are you ready to go,
David ? "
   I answered no, and entreated her not to let me go. I said that neither
Mr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever liked me, or had ever been kind to me.
That they had made my mama, who always loved me dearly, unhappy about
me, and that I knew it well, and that Peggotty knew it. I said that I
had been more miserable than I thought anybody could believe, who only
knew how young I was. And I begged and prayed my aunt-I forget in
what terms now, but I remember that they affected me very much then-
to befriend and protect me, for my father's sake.
   " Mr. Dick," said my aunt, " what shall I do with this child? "
   Mr. Dick considered, hesitated, brightened, and rejoined, " Have him
measured for a suit of clothes directly."
   " Mr. Dick," said my aunt, triumphantly, "give me your hand, for

your common sense is invaluable." Having shaken it with great cordiality,
she pulled me towards her, and said to Mr. Murdstone :
   " You can go when you like; I'll take my chance with the boy. If
he 's all you say he is, at least I can do as much for him then, as you have
done. But I don't believe a word of it."
 152           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     c' Miss Trotwood," rejoined Mr. Murdstone, shrugging his shoulders,
  as he rose, "if you were a gentleman-"
     " Bah ! stuff and nonsense ! " said my aunt.   "Don't talk to me !"
     " How exquisitely polite ! " exclaimed Miss Murdstone, rising. " Over-
 powering, really ! "
     " Do you think I don't know," said my aunt, turning a deaf ear to the

 sister, and continuing to address the brother, and to shake her head at
 him with infinite expression, " what kind of life you must have led that
 poor, unhappy, misdirected baby ? Do you think I don't know what a
 woeful day it was for the soft little creature, when you first came in her
 way-smirking and making great eyes at her, I'll be bound, as if you
 couldn't say boh ! to a goose ! "
    " I never heard anything so elegant ! " said Miss Murdstone.

    "Do you think I can't understand you as well as if I had seen you,"
pursued my aunt, " now that I do see and hear you-which, I tell you
 candidly, is anything but a pleasure to me ? Oh yes, bless us ! who so
 smooth and silky as Mr. Murdstone at first ! The poor, benighted inno-
 cent had never seen such a man. H e was made of sweetness. He wor-
 shipped her. He doted on her boy-tenderly doted on him! He was
to be another father to him, and they were all to live together in a garden
of roses, weren't they ? Ugh ! Get along with you, do ! " said my aunt.
    " I never heard anything like this person in my life ! " exclaimed

Miss Murdstone.
    " And when you had made sure of the poor little fool," said my aunt
-"     God forgive me that I should call her so, and she gone where
you won't go in a hurry-because you had not done wrong enough to her
 and hers, you must begin to train her, must you? begin to break her, like
 a poor caged bird, and wear her deluded life away, in teaching her to
 sing your notes ? "
     "This is either insanity or intoxication," said Miss Murdstone, in a
 perfect agony at not being able to turn the current of my aunt's address
 towards herself; " and my suspicion is, that it's intoxication."
    Miss Betsey, without taking the least notice of the interruption, con-
tinued to address herself to Mr. Murdstone as if there had been no
such thing.
    "Mr. Murdstone,'' she said, shaking her finger at him, " you were a
tyrant to the simple baby, and you broke her heart. She was a loving
baby-I know that; I knew it, years before you ever saw her-and
through the best part of her weakness, you gave her the wounds she died
of. There is the truth for your comfort, however you like it. And you
and your instruments may make the most of it."
   " Allow me to inquire, Miss Trotwood," interposed Miss Murdstone,
" whom you are pleased to call, in a choice of words in which I am not
experienced, my brother's instruments ? "
   Still stone-deaf to the voice, and utterly unmoved by it, Miss Betsey
pursued her discourse.
   " I t was clear enough, as I have told you, years before you ever saw
her-and why, in the mysterious dispensations of Providence, you ever
did see her, is more than humanity can comprehend-it was clear enough
that the poor soft little thing would marry somebody, at some time or
other; but I did hope it wouldn't have been as bad as it has turned out.
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

That was the time, Mr. Murdstone, when she gave birth to her boy here,"
said my aunt ; "to the poor child you sometimes tormented her through
afterwards, which is a disagreeable remembrance, and makes the sight of
him odious now. Aye, aye ! you needn't wince ! " said my aunt, " I know
it's true without that."
    He had stood by the door, all this while, observant of her with a smile
upon his face, though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted. I
remarked now, that, though the smile was on his face still, his colour
had gone in a moment, and he seemed to breathe as if he had been run-
ning.
    " Good day, sir ! " said my aunt, " and good bye !    Good day to you
too, ma'am," said my aunt, turning suddenly upon his sister. "Let
me see you ride a donkey over my green again, and as sure as you
have a head upon your shoulders, I'll knock your bonnet off, and tread
upon it ! "
    I t would require a painter, and no common painter too, to depict my
aunt's face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment, and
Miss Murdstone's face as she heard it. But the manner of the speech,
no less than the matter, was so fiery, that Miss Murdstone, without a
word in answer, discreetly put her arm through her brother's, and walked
haughtily out of the cottage ; my aunt remaining in the window looking
after them ; prepared, I have no doubt, in case of the donkey's reappear-
ance, to carry her threat into instant execution.
    No attempt at defiance being made, however, her face gradually relaxed,
and became so pleasant, that I was emboldened to kiss and thank her;
which I did with great heartiness, and with both my arms clasped round
her neck. I then shook hands with Mr. Dick, who shook hands with me
a great many times, and hailed this happy close of the proceedings with
repeated bursts of laughter.
     "You'll consider yourself guardian, jointly with me, of this child,
Mr. Dick," said my aunt.
    " I shall be delighted," said Mr. Dick, " to be the guardian of David's

son."
    "Very good," returned my aunt, " that's settled. I have been
thinking, do you know, Mr. Dick, that I might call him Trotwood?"
     " Certainly, certainly. Call him Trotwood, certainly," said Mr. Dick.
 " David's son's Trotwood."
    " Trotwood Copperfield, you mean," returned my aunt.

     " Yes, to be sure. Yes. Trotwood Copperfield," said Mr. Dick, a little
 abashed.
     My aunt took so kindly to the notion, that some ready-made clothes,
 which were purchased for me that afternoon, were marked "Trotwood
 Copperfield," in her own handwriting, and in indelible marking-ink, before
 I put them on ; and it was settled that all the other clothes which were
 ordered to be made for me (a complete outfit was bespoke that afternoon)
 should be marked in the same way.
     Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new
 about me. Now that the state of doubt was over, I felt, for many days,
 like one in a dream. I never thought that I had a curious couple of
 guardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick. I never thought of anything about
 myself, distinctly. The two things clearest in my mind were, that a
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life-which seemed to
lie in the haze of an immeasurable distance; and that a curtain had for
ever fallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby's. No one has ever
raised that curtain since. I have lifted it for a moment, even in this
narrative, with a reluctant hand, and dropped it gladly. The remem-
brance of that life is fraught with so much pain to me, with so much
mental suffering and want of hope, that I have never had the courage
even to examine how long I was doomed to lead it. Whether it lasted
for a year, or more, or less, I do not know. I only know that it was,
and ceased to be ; and that I have written, and there I leave it.




                            CHAPTER XV.
                     I MAKE ANOTHER BEGINNING.

   MR. DICK and I soon became the best of friends, and very often, when
his day's work was done, went out together to fly the great kite. Every
day of his life he had a long sitting at the Memorial, which never made
the least progress, however hard he labored, for King Charles the First
always strayed into it, sooner or later, and then it was thrown aside, and
another one begun. The patience and hope with which he bore these per-
petual disappointments, the mild perception he had that there was some-
thing wrong about King Charles the First, the feeble efforts he made to
 keep him out, and the certainty with which he came in, and tumbled the
 Memorial out of all shape, made a deep impression on me. What Mr.
 Dick supposed would come of the Memorial, if it were completed ; where
he thought it was to go, or what he thought it was to do ; he knew no
 more than anybody else, I believe. Nor was it at all necessary that he
should trouble himself with such questions, for if anything were certain
under the sun, it was certain that the Memorial never would be finished.
   It was quite an affecting sight, I used to think, to see him with
the kite when it was up a great height in the air. What he had told
me, in his room, about his belief in its disseminating the statements
pasted on it, which were nothing but old leaves of abortive Memorials,
might have been a fancy with him sometimes; but not when he was out,
looking up at the kite in the sky, and feeling it pull and tug at his
hand. He never looked so serene as he did then. I used to fancy, as I
sat by him of an evening, on a green slope, and saw him watch the
kite high in the quiet air, that it lifted his mind out of its confusion, and
bore it (such was my boyish thought) into the skies. As he wound the
string in, and it came lower and lower down out of the beautiful light,
until it fluttered to the ground, and lay there like a dead thing, he seemed
to wake gradually out of a dream ; and I remember to have seen him take
it up, and look about him in a lost way, as if they had both come down
 together, so that I pitied him with all my heart.
    While I advanced in friendship and intimacy with Mr. Dick, I did not
 go backward in the favor of his staunch friend, my aunt. She took SO
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

 kindly to me, that, in the course of a few weeks, she shortened my adopted
 name of Trotwood into Trot ; and even encouraged me to hope that if I
 went on as I had begun, I might take equal rank in her affections with
 my sister Betsey Trotwood.
      " Trot," said my aunt one evening, when the backgammon-board was

 placed as usual for herself and Mr.Dick, "we must not forget your
 education."
      This was my only subject of anxiety, and I felt quite delighted by her
 referring to it.
      " Should you like to go to school at Canterbury? " said my aunt.
      I replied that I should like it very much, as it was so near her.
      " Good," said my aunt.       " Should you like to go to-morrow ? "
     Being already no stranger to the general rapidity of my aunt's evolu-
 tions, I was not surprised by the suddenness of the proposal, and said :
 c r Yes."
      " Good," said my aunt again. " Janet, hire the grey pony and chaise
 to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, and pack up Master Trotwood's clothes
 to-night."
      I was greatly elated by these orders; but my heart smote me for my
 selfishness, when I witnessed their effect on Mr. Dick, who was so low-
 spirited at the prospect of our separation, and played so ill in consequence,
 that my aunt, after giving him several admonitory raps on the knuckles
with her dice-box, shut up the board, and declined to play with him any
 more. But, on hearing from my aunt that I should sometimes come over
on a Saturday, and that he could sometimes come and see me on a Wed-
nesday, he revived; and vowed to make another kite for those occasions,
of proportions greatly surpassing the present one. I n the morning he
was downhearted again, and would have sustained himself by giving me
all the money he had in his possession, gold and silver too, if my aunt had
not interposed, and limited the gift to five shillings, which, at his earnest
petition, were afterwards increased to ten. We parted at the garden-gate
in a most affectionate manner, and Mr. Dick did not go into the house
until my aunt had driven me out of sight of it.
     My aunt, who was perfectly indifferent to public opinion, drove the grey
pony through Dover in a masterly manner; sitting high and stiff like a
state coachman, keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went, and
making a point of not letting him have his own way in any respect.
When we came into the country road, she permitted him to relax a little,
however; and looking at me down in a valley of cushion by her side,
asked me whether I was happy.
     "Very happy indeed, thank you, aunt," I said.
     She was much gratified; and both her hands being occupied, patted
me on the head with her whip.
     " I s it a large school, aunt ?" I asked.
     "Why, I don't know," said my aunt. '' We are going to Mr. Wick-
field's first."
     cc Does he keep a school?" I asked.
     " No, Trot," said my aunt.       " H e keeps an office."
     I asked for no more information about Mr. Wickfield, as she offered
none, and we conversed on other subjects until we came to Canterbury,
where, as it was market-day, my aunt had a great opportunity of insinu-
156            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  ating the grey pony among carts, baskets, vegetables, and huckster's
 goods. The hair-breadth turns and twists we made, drew down upon
 us a variety of speeches from the people standing about, which were not
 always complimentary; but my aunt drove on with perfect indifference,
 and I dare say would have taken her own way with as much coolness
 through an enemy's country.
    At length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road ;
 a house with long low lattice-windows bulging out still farther, and beams
with carved heads on the ends bulging out too, so that I fancied the whole
house was leaning forward, trying to see who was passing on the narrow
pavement below. I t was quite spotless in its cleanliness. The old-
fashioned brass knocker on the low arched door, ornamented with carved
garlands of fruit and flowers, twinkled like a star; the two stone steps
descending to the door were as white as if they had been covered with
fair linen; and all the angles and corners, and carvings and mouldings,
and quaint little panes of glass, and quainter little windows, though as old
as the hills, were as pure as any snow that ever fell upon the hills.
    When the pony-chaise stopped at the door, and my eyes were intent
upon the house, I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the
ground floor (in a little round tower that formed one side of the
house), and quickly disappear. The low arched door then opened, and
the face came out. I t was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in
the window, though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which
is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people. I t belonged
to a red-haired person-a youth of fifteen, as I take it now, but looking
 much older-whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble; who
 had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a red-brown;
 so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he went to
 sleep. He was high-shouldered and bony ; dressed in decent black, with
 a white wisp of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat ; and had a long,
 lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention, as he stood
 at the pony's head, rubbing his chin with it, and looking up at us in the
 chaise.
    " I s Mr. Wickfield at home, Uriah Heep ? " said my aunt.

    "Mr. Wickfield's at home, ma'am," said Uriah Heep, " if you 1' 1
please to walk in therey'-pointing with his long hand to the room he meant.
    We got out; and leaving him to hold the pony, went into a long low
parlor looking towards the street, from the window of which I caught a
glimpse, as I went in, of Uriah Heep breathing into the pony's nostrils,
and immediately covering them with his hand, as if he were putting some
spell upon him. Opposite to the tall old chimney-piece, were two por-
traits : one of a gentleman with grey hair (though not by any means an
old man) and black eyebrows, who was looking over some papers tied
together with red tape ; the other, of a lady, with a very placid and sweet
expression of face, who was looking at me.
    I believe I was turning about in search of Uriah's picture, when,
a door at the farther end of the room opening, a gentleman entered,
at sight of whom I turned to the first-mentioned portrait again, to make
quite sure that it had not come out of its frame. But it was stationary;
 and as the gentleman advanced into the light, I saw that he was some
 years older than when he had had his picture painted.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

     " Miss Betsey Trotwood," said the gentleman, " pray walk in. I was
 engaged for the moment, but you'll excuse my being busy. You know
 my motive. I have but one in life."
    Miss Betsey thanked him, and we went into his room, which was fur-
 nished as an office, with books, papers, tin boxes, and so forth. I t looked
 into a garden, and had an iron safe let into the wall ; so immediately over
 the mantel-shelf, that I wondered, as I sat down, how the sweeps got
 round it when they swept the chimney.
     " Well, Miss Trotwood," said Mr. Wickfield ; for I soon found that it

 was he, and that he was a lawyer, and steward of the estates of a rich
 gentleman of the county; "what wind blows you here? Not an ill
 wind, I hope ? "
    "No," replied my aunt, "I have not come for any law."
    " That 's right, ma'am," said Mr. Wickfield.      " You had better come

for anything eise."
    His hair was quite white now, though his eyebrows were still black.
H e had a very agreeable face, and, I thought, was handsome. There was
a certain richness in his complexion, which I had been long accustomed,
under Peggotty's tuition, to connect with port wine ; and I fancied it was
in his voke too, and referred his gowing corpulency to the same cause.
He was very cleanly dressed, in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, and nankeen
trowsers ; and his h e frilled shirt and cambric neckcloth looked unusually
soft and white, reminding my strolling fancy (I call to mind) of the
plumage on the breast of a swan.
    <' This is my nephew," said my aunt.
    "Wasn't aware you had one, Miss Trotwood," said Mr. Wickfield.
       My grand-nephew, that is to say," observed my aunt.
       Wasn't aware you had a grand-nephew, I give you my word," said
Mr. Wickfield.
    " I have adopted him," said my aunt, with a wave of her hand,
importing that his knowledge and his ignorance were all one to her, " and
I have brought him here, to put him to a school where he may be
thoroughly well taught, and well treated. Now tell me where that school
is, and what it is, and all about it."
    "Before I can advise you properly," said Mr. Wickfield,-" the old
question, you know. What 's your motive in this ? "
    "Deuce take the man!" exclaimed my aunt. "Always fishing for
motives, when they 're on the surface! Why, to make the child happy
and useful."
    " I t must be a mixed motive, I think," said Mr. Wickfield, shaking- his
head and smiling incredulously.
    cc A mixed fiddlestick ! " returned my aunt.   " You claim to have one
plain motive in all you do yourself. You don't suppose, I hope, that you
are the only plain dealer in the world ? "
    " Ay, but I have only one motive in life, Miss Trotwood," he rejoined,
smiling. " Other people have dozens, scores, hundreds. I have only one.
There's the difference. However, that's beside the question. The best
school? Whatever the motive, you want the best ? "
   My aunt nodded assent.
   " At the best we have," said Mr. Wickfield, considering, " your nephew

couldn't board just now."
158           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     a But he could board somewhere else, I suppose ? " suggested my aunt.
    Mr. Wickfield thought I could. After a little discussion, he proposed
 to take my aunt to the school, that she might see it and judge for herself;
 also, to take her, with the same object, to two or three houses where he
 thought I could be boarded. My aunt embracing the proposal, we were
 all three going out together, when he stopped and said :
    " Our little friend here might have some motive, perhaps, for objecting
to the arrangements. I think we had better leave him behind ? "
    My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point ; but to facilitate matters
I said I would gladly remain behind, if they pleased; and returned into
Mr. Wickfield's office, where I sat down again, in the chair I had first
occupied, to await their return.
    I t so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage, which
ended in the little circular room where I had seen Uriah Heep's pale face
looking out of window. Uriah, having taken the pony to a neighbouring
stable, was at work at a desk in this room, which had a brass frame on the
top to hang papers upon, and on which the writing he was making a copy
of was then hanging. Though his face was towards me, I thought, for
some time, the writing being between us, that he could not see me ; but
looking that way more attentively, it made me uncomfortable to observe
that, every now and then, his sleepless eyes would come below the writing,
like two red suns, and stealthily stare at me for I dare say a whole minute
at a time, during which his pen went, or pretended to go, as cleverly as
ever. I made several attempts to get out of their way-such as standing
on a chair to look at a map on the other side of the room, and poring over
the columns of a Kentish newspaper-but they always attracted me back
 again ; and whenever I looked towards those two red suns, I was sure to
 find them, either just rising or just setting.
    At length, much to my relief, my aunt and Mr. Wickfield came back,
 after a pretty long absence. They were not so successful as I could have
 wished; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable, my aunt
had not approved of any of the boarding-houses proposed for me.
    " It's very unfortunate," said my aunt. " I don't know what to do,
Trot."
    " I t does happen unfortunately," said Mr. Wickfield. " But I '11 tell
you what you can do, Miss Trotwood."
    " What's that ? " inquired my aunt.
    "Leave your nephew here, for the present. He's a quiet fellow. He
won't disturb me at all. I t ' s a capital house for study. As quiet as a
monastery, and almost as roomy. Leave him here."
    My aunt evidently liked the offer, though she was delicate of accepting
it. So did I.
    " Come, Miss Trotwood," said Mr. Wickfield.       " This is the way out
of the difficulty. It's only a temporary arrangement, you know. If it
don't act well, or don't quite accord with our mutual convenience, he can
easily go to the right about. There will be time to find some better
place for him in the meanwhile. You had better determine to leave him
here for the present ! "
    "I am very much obliged to you," said my aunt; "and so is he, I
 see ; but-"
     " Come ! I know what you mean," cried Mr. Wickfield.       "You shall
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           159
not be oppressed by the receipt of favors, Miss Trotwood. You may
Pa7 for him if you like. We won't be hard about terms, but you shall
pajr if you will?'
       On that understanding," said my aunt, "though it doesn't lessen the
real obligation, I shall be very glad tb leave him."-
    '' Then come and see my little housekeeper," said Mr. Wickfield.
   We accordingly went up a wonderful old staircase ; with a balustrade
so broad that we might have gone up that, almost as easily; and into a
shady old drawing-room, lighted by some three or four of the quaint
windows I had looked up at from the street: which had old oak seats in
them, that seemed to have come of the same trees as the shining oak
floor, and the great beams in the ceiling. I t was a prettily furnished
room, with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green, and some
flowers. I t seemed to be all old nooks and corners ; and in every nook
and corner there was some queer little table, or cupboard, or bookcase, or
seat, or something or other, that made me think there was not such
another good corner in the room ; until I looked at the next one, and found
it equal to it, if not better. On everything there was the same air of
retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside.
   Mr. Wickfield tapped at a door in a corner of the panneled wall, and
a girl of about my own age came quickly out and kissed him. On her
face, I saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose
picture had looked at me down-stairs. I t seemed to my imagination as
if the portrait had grown womanly, and the original remained a child.
Although her face was quite bright and happy, there was a tranquillity
about it, and about her-a quiet, good, calm spirit-that I never have
forgotten; that I never shall forget.
   This was his little housekeeper, his daughter Agnes, Mr. Wickfield
said. When I heard how he said it, and saw how he held her hand, I
guessed what the one motive of his life was.
   She had a little basket-trifle hanging at her side, with keys in i t ; and
looked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house could have.
She listened to her father as he told her about me, with a pleasant face ;
and when he had concluded, proposed to my aunt that we should go up-
stairs and see my room. We all went together; she before us : and a
glorious old room it was, with more oak beams, and diamond panes ; and
the broad balustrade going all the way up to it.
   I cannot call to mind where or when, in my childhood, I had seen a
stained glass window in a church. Nor do I recollect its subject. But I
know that when I saw her turn round, in the grave light of the old
staircase, and wait for us, above, I thought of that window; and that I
associated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield
ever afterwards.
   My aunt was as happy as I was, in the arrangement made for me; and
we went down to the drawing-room again, well pleased and gratified.
As she would not hear of staying to dinner, lest she should by any chance
fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark ; and as I apprehend
Mr. Wickfield knew her too well, to argue any point with her ; some lunch
was provided for her there, and Agnes went back to her governess, and
Mr. Wickfield to his office. So we were left to take leave of one another
without any restraint.
160           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     She told me that everything would be arranged for me by Mr. Wick-
field, and that I should want for nothing, and gave me the kindest words
and the best advice.
     "Trot," said my aunt in conclusion, "be a credit to yourself, to me,
and Mr. Dick, and Heaven be with you ! "
    I was greatly overcome, and could only thank her, again and again,
and send my love to Mr. Dick.
    " Never," said my aunt, "be mean in anything ; never be false ; never

be cruel. Avoid those three vices, Trot, and I can always be hopeful of you."
    I promised, as well as I could, that I would not abuse her kindness or
forget her admonition.
    "The pony's at the door," said my aunt, "and I am off! Stay here."
    With these words she embraced me hastily, and went out of the room,
shutting the door after her. At first I was startled by so abrupt a
departure, and almost feared I had displeased her; but when I looked
into the street, and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise, and drove
away without looking up, I understood her better, and did not do her
that injustice.
    By five o'clock, which was Mr. Wickfield's dinner hour, I had mustered
up my spirits again, and was ready for my knife and fork. The cloth was
only laid for us two ; but Agnes was waiting in the drawing-room before
dinner, went down with her father, and sat opposite to him at table. I
doubted whether he could have dined without her.
     We did not stay there, after dinner, but came up-stairs into the draw-
 ing-room again : in one snug corner of which, Agnes set glasses for
 her father, and a decanter of port wine. I thought he would have missed
 its usual flavor, if it had been put there for him by any other hands.
     There he sat, taking his wine, and taking a good deal of it, for two
 hours; while Agnes played on the piano, worked, and talked to him and
 me. He was, for the most part, gay and cheerful with us; but sometimes
 his eyes rested on her, and he fell into a brooding state, and was silent.
 She always observed this quickly, as I thought, and always roused him with
 a question or caress. Then he came out of his meditation, and drank
 more wine.
     Agnes made the tea, and presided over it; and the time passed away after
it, as after dinner, until she went to bed; when her father took her in his
 arms and kissed her, and, she being gone, ordered candles in his office.
Then I went to bed too.
     But in the course of the evening I had rambled down to the door, and
a little way along the street, that I might have another peep at the old
houses, and the grey Cathedral; and might think of my coming through
that old city on my journey, and of my passing the very house I lived in,
 without knowing it. As I came back, I saw Uriah Heep shutting up the
 office ; and feeling friendly towards everybody, went in and spoke to him,
 and at parting, gave him my hand. But oh, what a clammy hand his
 was ! as ghostly to the touch as to the sight ! I rubbed mine afterwards,
 to warm it, and to rub his of.
     It was such an uncomfortable hand, that, when I went to my room, it
 was still cold and wet upon my memory. Leaning out of window, and
  seeing one of the faces on the beam-ends looking at me sideways, I fancied
  it was Uriah Heep got up there somehow, and shut him out in a hurry.
                         M Y SEA-SIDE TRIP.
                                              __e_
  I CANNOT look hack on the past month or two without feelings of considerable pleasure.
   My stay by the sea-side not only replenished my health, but also afforded me many opportunities of
making useful and interesting observations. The difference of character is one thing which I cannot
pass by without observation in such scenes and on such occasions.
   The leisure which I had at command gave me an opportunity of noticing this diversity of character.
But I could not help remarking that one general rule in point of fashion seemed to influence all parties.
   For instance, previously to my taking up my marine abode, I gave E. MOSES& SON a n order for
various requisites in Summer attire, which order was executed greatly to the credit of the Proprietors, and
greatly to the satisfaction of myself.
   On arriving at my destination, and mingling, as I did, with the klite at the Watering-place where I had
chosen to stay, I found that the fashion and make of my dress were precisely the same as those of the
principal part of the visitors.
   E. MOSES& SON, I found, had been the Tailors selected by these parties, who know well how to make
a judicious selection in such matters as attire.
   I was highly pleased at the result of my observations, and I determined not to let Moses & SONbe the
losers. So long as Watering-places have visitors, and so long as fashion is an object in such circles as
frequent these retreats, so long will I purchase my dress of MOSES& SON. I understand that their
present stock is of the most admirable description, and, as the Autumn is here, I shall go for a suit where
I went previously to taking my sea-side trip.

   CAUTION.-E MOSES & SON regret having to guard the public against imposition, hut having heard
that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or it is the same concern, has heen
resorted to in many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion withany
other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 36, Pargate, Sheffield, and 19,
Thornton's Buildings, Bradford, Yorkshire ; and those who desire genuine and cheap Clothing, &c., should
call at or send to Minories and Aldgate, City, London ;or to the Branch Establishments as above.

  BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NlCOLL), there is
another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUINEAS.




     The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                         Her majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
   THE REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Autumnal Months, with
all the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two
GUINEAS.     Thus It deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,
but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the
intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,
within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,
with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be seen, ready for
immediate wear, in every size, a t the Patentees' Warerooms.

T   H E peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
              FRENCH W O O L MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest material, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,
             GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
  These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
                  THE EIDER DOWN QUILT
also, is to be seen only a t their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
Carriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                            BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, W I T H PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable.

                                                                       Number of


    THE ART-JOURNAL.
 I T will be Illustrated by upwards of ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY Engravings o n Wood,
      comprising a large majority of the leading works contained in the Exposition-ln silver, electro-silver
bronze, brass (east and pressed), iron, porcelain, earthenware, and glass; of objects in papier-machi$; 0;
japanned goods; carvings in wood; and the several productions of metal which constitute the main staple of
British industry, and render Birmingham the great capital of British manulactures.
   These will evidence a n astonishing advance in Art within the last few years; and sufficiently prove the
power of the English manufacturer t o compete with the best fabricants of France.
   The Exhibition at Birmingham cannot fail to have great influence on the future course of Manufactured Art
 in England-extending its repute and augmenting its mercantile value.
   The Editor of the "ART-JOURNAL"          has, therefore, considered i t his duty to make arrangements for
reporting this Exposition on a scale somewhat commensurate with the magnitude and liberality of the
enterprise.
   The October number of the "ART-JOURNAL"             will also contain three engravings on steel-" Malvolio,'
 engraved by Staines, from the painting by Maclise, R.A.; "The Truant," engraved by Phillibrown, from the
 painting by Webster, R.A.-both in the '' VERNON       GALLERY;"and of "Sabrina," engraved by Artlett from the
 statue, by Marshall, A.R.A.
   The " ART-JOURNAL      " of the past eight months contains, besides several hundred engravings on wood, n o
 fewer than twenty-five engravings on steel ; each ot which may be regarded as a fine and beautiful specimen
 of Art : they consist chiefly of line engravings from the best plctnres of the best Brttish artists, contained i n
 the VERNON    GALLERY-tne collectiou presented by the late Robert Vernon, Esq., to the British people.
   To the amateur, the connoisseur, the artist, and the public generally, this work cannot fail to be an acqnisi-
 tion of considerable value; the purest and best Art is thus circulated at the smallest possible cost t o the
 purchaser: "Mr. VERNON'S       magnificent gift is thus made doubly the property of the people. To the humblest
 classes throughout the whole kmgdom, it becomes in some degree accessible, and a source of enjoyment and
 instruction."
    The ART-JOURNAL

                             CHAPTER XVI.
            I AM A NEW BOY I N MORE SENSES THAN ONP;.

   NEXTmorning, after breakfast, I entered on school life again. I went,
accompanied by Mr. Wickfield, to the scene of my future studies-a grave
building in a court-yard, with a learned air about it that seemed very well
suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the Cathedral
towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grass-plot-and was intro-
duced to my new master, Doctor Strong.
   Doctor Strong looked almost as rusty, to my thinking, as the tall iron
rails and gates outside the house; and almost as stiff and heavy as the great
stone urns that flanked them,and were set up, on the top of the red-brick wall,
at regular distances all round the court, like sublimated skittles, for Time
to play at. He was in his library (I mean Doctor Strong was), with his
clothes not particularly well brushed, and his hair not particularly well
combed ; his knee-smalls unbraced ; his long black gaiters unbuttoned ; and
his shoes yawning like two caverns on the hearth-rug. Turning upon me
a lustreless eye, that reminded me of a long-forgotten blind old horse who
once used to crop the grass, and tumble over the graves, in Blunderstone
churchyard, he said he was glad to see me: and then he gave me his
hand; which I didn't know what to do with, as it did nothing for itself.
   But, sitting at work, not far off from Doctor Strong, was a very
pretty young lady-whom he called Annie, and who was his daughter,
I supposed-who got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to
put Doctor Strong's shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she did
with great cheerfulness and quickness. When she had finished, and
we were going out to the school-room, I was much surprised to hear Mr.
Wickfield, in bidding her good morning, address her as "Mrs. Strong; "
and I was wondering could she be Doctor Strong's son's wife, or could
she be Mrs. Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously
enlightened me.
   "By the bye, Wickfield," he said, stopping in a passage with his hand
on my shoulder ; "you have not found any suitable provision for my wife's
cousin yet?"
   " No," said Mr. Wickfield. " No. Not yet."
   " I could wish it done as soon as it can be done, Wickfield," said
Doctor Strong, " for Jack Maldon is needy, and idle ; and of those two bad
things, worse things sometimes come. What does Doctor Watts say,"
he added, looking at me, and moving his head to the time of his quota-
tion, " ' Satan finds some mischief still, for idle hands to do.' "
    " Egad, doctor," returned Mr. Wickfield, " if Doctor Watts knew man-

 kind, he might have written, with as much truth, ' Satan finds some mis-
 chief still, for busy hands to do.' The busy people achieve their full
 share of mischief in the world, you may rely upon it. What have the
 people been about, who have been the busiest in getting money, and in
 getting power, this century or two ? No mischief? "
                                                                 M
162           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Jack Maldon will never be very busy in getting either, I expect,"

said Doctor Strong, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
    " Perhaps not," said Mr. Wickfield ; " and you bring me back to the

question, with an apology for digressing. No, I have not been able to
dispose of Mr. Jack Maldon yet. I believe," he said this with some hesita-
tion, "I penetrate your motive, and it makes the thing more difficult."
    "My motive," returned Dr. Strong, "is to make some suitable pro-
vision for a cousin, and an old playfellow, of Annie's."
    " Yes, I know," said Mr. Wickfield; " at home or abroad."
    " Aye !" replied the Doctor, apparently wondering why he emphasised
those words so much. " At home or abroad."
    '' Your own expression, you know," said Mr. Wickfield. " Or abroad."
    " Surely," the Doctor answered.     " Surely.    One or other."
    " One or other?    Have you no choice?" asked Mr. Wickfield.
    " No," returned the Doctor.
    " No ?" with astonishment.

    " Not the least."

    " No motive,"said hlr.Wickfield, "for meaning abroad,and not athome?"

    " No," returned the Doctor.

    " I am bound to believe you, and of course I do believe you," said

Mr. Wickfield. " I t might have simplified my office very much, if I had
known it before. But I confess I entertained another impression."
    Doctor Strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look, which
almost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great encourage-
ment; for it was full of amiability and sweetness, and there was a
 simplicity in it, and indeed in his whole manner, when the studious,
pondering frost upon it was got through, very attractive and hopeful
to a young scholar like me. Repeating " no," and " not the least," and
other short assurances to the same purport, Doctor Strong jogged on
before us, at a queer, uneven pace; and we followed: Mr. Wickfield
 looking grave, I observed, and shaking his head to himself, without
 knowing that I saw him.
    The school-room was a pretty large hall, on the quietest side of the
 house, confronted by the stately stare of some half-dozen of the great
urns, and commanding a peep of an old secluded garden belonging to the
 Doctor, where the peaches were ripening on the sunny south wall. There
 were two great aloes,in tubs, on the turf outside thewindows; the broad hard
 leaves of which plant (looking as if they were made of painted tin) have
 ever since, by association, been symbolical to me of silence and retirement.
 About five-and-twenty boys were studiously engaged at their books when
 we went in, but they rose to give the Doctor good morning, and remained
 standing when they saw Mr. Wickfield and me.
     " A new boy, young       gentlemen," said the Doctor ; " Trotwood
 Copperfield."
     One Adarns, who was the head-boy, then stepped out of his place and
 welcomed me. H e looked like a young clergyman, in his white cravat, but
  he was very affable and good-humored ; and he showed me my place, and
  presented me to the masters, in a gentlemanly way that would have put
  me at my ease, if anything could.
     I t seemed to me so long, however, since I had been among such boys,
  or among any companions of my own age, except Mick Walker and Mealey
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         163
  Potatoes, that I felt as strange as ever I have done in all my life. I was
  so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have
  no knowledge, and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age,
  appearance, and condition, as one of them, that I half believed it was an
  imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy. I had become,
  in the Murdstone and Grinby time, however short or long it may have been,
  so unused to the sports and games of boys, that I knew I was awkward
  and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them. Whatever
  I had learnt, had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life
  from day to night, that now, when I was examined about what I knew, I
  knew nothing, and was put into the lowest form of the school. But,
 troubled as I was, by my want of boyish skill, and of book-learning too, I
 was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration, that, in what
  I did know, I was much farther removed from my companions than in
  what I did not. My mind ran upon what they would think, if they knew
  of my familiar acquaintance with the King's Bench Prison? Was there
  anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with
 the Micawber family-all those pawnings, and sellings, and suppers-in
  spite of myself? Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through
  Canterbury, wayworn and ragged, and should find me out ? What would
 they say, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had
 scraped my halfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and
 beer, or my slices of pudding? How would it affect them, who were so
 innocent of London life, and London streets, to discover how knowing I
 was (and was ashamed to be) in some of the meanest phases of both?
 All this ran in my head so much, on that first day at Doctor Strong's,
 that I felt distrustful of my slightest look and gesture; shrunk within
 myself whensoever I was approached by one of my new schoolfellows ; and
 hurried off the minute school was over, afraid of committing myself in
 my response to any friendly notice or advance.
    But there was such an influence in Mr. Wickfield's old house, that
when I knocked at it, with my new school-books under my arm, I began
to feel my uneasiness softening away. As I went up to my airy old room,
the grave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon my doubts and
fears, and to make the past more indistinct. I sat there, sturdily conning
my books, until dinner time (we were out of school for good at three) ; and
 went down, hopeful of becoming a passable sort of boy yet.
    Agnes was in the drawing-room, waiting for her father, who was
detained by some one in his office. She met me with her pleasant smile,
and asked me how I liked the school. I told her I should like it very
much, I hoped: but I was a little strange to it at first.
    " You have never been to school," I said, " have you ? "

    " Oh, yes ! Every day."
    " Ah, but you mean here, at your own home ? "
    "Papa couldn't spare me to go anywhere else," she answered, smiling
and shaking her head. " His housekeeper must be in his house, you know."
    " He is very fond of you, I am sure," I said.

    She nodded "Yes," and went to the door to listen for his coming up,
that she might meet him on the stairs. But, as he was not there, she
came back again.
                                      Y 2
164            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Mama has been dead ever since I was born," she said, in her quiet
way. "I only know her picture, down stairs. I saw you looking at it
yesterday. Did you think whose it was? "
    I told her yes, because it was so like herself.
      Papa says so, too," said Agnes, pleased. " Hark ! That's papa now ! "
    Her bright calm face lighted up with pleasure as she went to meet him,
and as they came in, hand in hand. He greeted me cordially; and told
me I should certainly be happy under Doctor Strong, who was one of the
gentlest of men.
    "There may be some, perhaps-I don't know that there are-who
abuse his kindness," said Mr. Wickfield. "Never be one of those,
Trotwood, in anything. He is the least suspicious of mankind; and
whether that's a merit, or whether it's a blemish, it deserves consideration
in all dealings with the Doctor, great or small."
    H e spoke, I thought, as if he were weary, or dissatisfied with something ;
but I did not pursue the question in my mind, for dinner was just then
announced, and we went down and took the same seats as before.
    We had scarcely done so, when Uriah Heep put in his red head and his
lank hand at the door, and said :
    " Here's Mr. Maldon begs the favor of a word, sir."
    " I am but this moment quit of Mr. Maldon," said his master.
    "Yes, sir," returned Uriah ; "but Mr. Maldon has come back, and he
begs the favor of a word."
    As he held the door open with his hand, Uriah looked at me, and looked at
Agnes, and looked at the dishes, and looked at the plates, andlooked at every
object in the room,I thought,-yet seemed to look at nothing; he made such
an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master.
    " I beg your pardon. I t ' s only to say, on reflection," observed a voice
behind Uriah, as Uriah's head was pushed away, and the speaker's sub-
 stituted-" pray excuse me for this intrusion-that as it seems I have no
 choice in the matter, the sooner I go abroad, the better. My cousin
 Annie did say, when we talked of it, that she liked to have her friends
within reach rather than to have them banished, and the old Doctor-"
     " Doctor Strong, was that ? " Mr. Wickfield interposed, gravely.
     " Doctor Strong of course," returned the other ; " I call him the old
Doctor-it 's all the same, you know."
     " I don't know," returned Mr. Wickfield.

     "Well, Doctor Strong," said the other-" Doctor Strong was of the
 same mind, I believed. But as it appears from the course you take with
 me that he has changed his mind, why there's no more to be said, except
 that the sooner I am off, the better. Therefore, I thought I ' d come back
 and say, that the sooner I am off, the better. When a plunge is to be
 made into the water, it's of no use lingering on the bank."
     " There shall be as little lingering as possible, in your case, Mr. Maldon,
 you may depend upon it," said Mr. Wickfield.
     " Thank'ee," said the other. " Much obliged. I don't want to look
 a gift-horse in the mouth, which is not a gracious thing to do ; otherwise,
 I dare say, my cousin Annie could easily arrange it in her own way. I
 suppose Annie would only have to say to the old Doctor-"
     " Meaning that Mrs. Strong would only have to say to her husband-

 do I follow you? " said Mr. Wickfield.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           165
   cc Quite so," returned the other, cc-would    only have to say, that she
wanted such and such a thing to be so and so ; and it would be so and so,
as a matter of course."
    "And why as a matter of course, Mr. Maldon? " asked Mr. Wickfield,
sedately eating his dinner.
    " Why, because Annie's a charming young girl, and the old Doctor-
Doctor Strong, I mean-is         not quite a charming young boy," said
Mr. Jack Maldon, laughing. " No offence to anybody, Mr. Wickfield.
I only mean that I suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable, in
that sort of marriage."
   " Compensation to the lady, sir? " asked Mr. Wickfield gravely.
    "To the lady, sir," Mr. Jack Maldon answered, laughing. But
appearing to remark that Mr. Wickfield went on with his dinner in the
same sedate, immoveable manner, and that there was no hope of making
him relax a muscle of his face, he added :
    " However, I have said what I came back to say, and, with another

apology for this intrusion, I may take myself off. Of course I shall
observe your directions, in considering the matter as one to be arranged
between you and me solely, and not to be referred to, up at the Doctor's."
    " Have you dined? " asked Mr. Wickfield, with a motion of his hand
towards the table.
    " Thank'ee. I am going to dine," said Mr. Maldon, "with my cousin
Annie. Good bye ! "
    Mr. Wickfield, without rising, looked after him thoughtfully as he went
out. He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman, I thought, with
a handsome face, a rapid utterance, and a confident, bold air. And this
was the first I ever saw of Mr. Jack Maldon ; whom I had not expected to
see so soon, when I heard the Doctor speak of him that morning.
    When we had dined, we went up-stairs again, where everything went
on exactly as on the previous day. Agnes set the glasses and decanters
in the same corner, and Mr. Wickfield sat down to drink, and drank a
good deal. Agnes played the piano to him, sat by him, and worked and
talked, and played some games at dominoes with me. I n good time she
made tea; and afterwards, when I brought down my books, looked into
them, and showed me what she knew of them (which was no slight matter,
though she said it was), and what was the best way to learn and under-
stand them. I see her, with her modest, orderly, placid manner, and I hear
her beautiful calm voice, as I write these words. The influence for all good,
which she came to exercise over me at a later time, begins already to
descend upon my breast. I love little Em'ly, and I don't love Agnes-no,
not at all in that way-but I feel that there are goodness, peace, and
truth, wherever Agnes is ; and that the soft light of the colored window in
 the church, seen long ago, falls on her always, and on me when I am near
 her, and on every thing around.
    The time having come for her withdrawal for the night, and she having
 left us, I gave Mr. Wickfield my hand, preparatory to going away myself.
 But he checkedme and said : <' Should youlike to stay with us, Trotwood,
or to go elsewhere? "
    " To stay" I answered, quickly.

    " You are sure ? "
    " If you please.  If I may ! "
 166           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   " Why, it's but a dull life that we lead here, boy, I am afraid,"   he said.
   " Not more dull for me than Agnes, sir. Not dull at all ! "
      " Than Agnes," he repeated, walking slowly to the great chimney-piece,
  and leaning against it. "Than Agnes !"
     He had drank wine that evening (or I fancied it), until his eyes were
 bloodshot. Not that I could see them now, for they were cast down,
  and shaded by his hand ; but I had noticed them a little while before.
     "Now I wonder," he muttered, "whether my Agnes tires of me.
 When should I ever tire of her ! But that 's different -that's quite
 different."
     H e was musing-not speaking to me ; so I remained quiet,
     " A dull old house," he said, " and a monotonous life ; but I must have
 her near me. I must keep her near me. If the thought that I may die and
 leave my darling, or that my darling may die and leave me, comes, like a
 spectre, to distress my happiest hours, and is only to be drowned in -"
     H e did not supply the word; but pacing slowly to the place where he
 had sat, and mechanically going through the action of pouring wine from
 the empty decanter, set it down and paced back again.
     " If it is miserable to bear, when she is here," he said, " what would it

 be, and she away ? No, no, no. I can not try that."
     H e leaned against the chimney-piece, brooding so long that I could
 not decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going, or to
 remain quietly where I was, until he should come out of his reverie. At
 length he aroused himself, and looked about the room until his eyes
 encountered mine.
     '' Stay with us, Trotwood, eh? " he said, in his usual manner, and as
 if he were answering something I had just said. "I am glad of it. You
 are company to us both. It is wholesome to have you here. Wholesome
 for me, wholesome for Agnes, wholesome perhaps for all of us."
     "I am sure it is for me, sir," I said. " I am so glad to be here."
     " That's a fine fellow ! " said Mr. Wickfield. " As long as you are
 glad to be here, you shall stay here." H e shook hands with me upon it,
 and clapped me on the back ; and told me that when I had anything to do
at night after Agnes had left us, or when I wished to read for my own
pleasure, I was free to come down to his room, if he were there and if I
 desired it for company's sake, and to sit with him. I thanked him for his
consideration; and, as he went down soon afterwards, and I was not tired,
went down too, with a book in my hand, to avail myself, for half-an-hour,
of his permission.
    But, seeing a light in the little round office, and immediately feeling
myself attracted towards Uriah Heep, who had a sort of fascination for me,
I went in there instead. I found Uriah reading a great fat book, with
such demonstrative attention, that his lank fore-finger followed up every
line as he read, and made clammy tracks along the page (or so I fully
believed) like a snail.
    "You are working late to-night, Uriah," says I.
    "Yes, Master Copperfield," says Uriah.
    As I was getting on the stool opposite, to talk to him more conveniently,
I observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about him, and that he
could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases down his cheeks,
one on each side, to stand for one.
                        OB DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   "I am not doing office-work, Master Copperfield," said Uriah.
   " What work, then ? " I asked.

   "I am improving my legal knowledge, Master Copperfield," said
Uriah. " I am going through Tidd's Practice. Oh, what a writer
Mr. Tidd is, Master Copperfield! "
   My stool was such a tower of observation, that as I watched him
reading on again, after this rapturous exclamation, and following up the
lines with his fore-finger, I observed that his nostrils, which were thin and
pointed, with sharp dints in them, had a singular and most uncomfortable
way of expanding and contracting themselves-that they seemed to
twinkle, instead of his eyes, which hardly ever twinkled at all.
   " I suppose you are quite a great lawyer ? " I said, after looking at him
for some time.
   " Me, Master Copperfield? " said Uriah.        " Oh, no ! I'm a very
umble person."
   I t was no fancy of mine about his hands, I observed; for he frequently
ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and warm,
besides often wiping them, in a stealthy way, on his pocket-handkerchief.
   " I am well aware that I am the umblest person going," said Uriah Heep,

modestly; "let the other be where he may. My mother is likewise a
very umble person. We live in a numble abode, Master Copperfield, but
have much to be thankful for. My father's former calling was umble.
He was a sexton."
   " What is he now? " I asked.
   "He is a partaker of glory at present, Master Copperfield," said Uriah
Heep. " But we have much to be thankful for. How much have I to be
thankful for, in living with Mr. Wickfield ! "
   I asked Uriah if he had been with Mr. Wickfield long?
   " I have been with him, going on four year, Master Copperfield," said
Uriah; shutting up his book, after carefully marking the place where he
had left off. " Since a year after my father's death. How much have I to
be thankful for, in that ! How much have I to be thankful for, in Mr.
Wickfield's kind intention to give me my articles, which would otherwise
not lay within the umble means of mother and self! "
   " Then, when your articled time is over, you'll be a regular lawyer, I
suppose ? " said I.
   " With   the blessing of Providence, Master Copperfield," returned
Uriah.
   "Perhaps you'll be a partner in Mr. Wickfield's business, one of these
days," I said, to make myself agreeable ; " and it will be Wickfield and
Heep, or Heep late Wickfield."
   " Oh, no, Master Copperfield," returned Uriah, shaking his head, " I
am much too umble for that ! "
   He certainly did look uncommonly like the carved face on the beam
outside my window, as he sat, in his humility, eyeing me sideways, with
his mouth widened, and the creases in his cheeks.
   "Mr. Wickfield is a most excellent man, Master Copperfield," said
Uriah. "If you have known him long, you know it, I am sure, much
better than I can inform you."
   I replied that I was certain he was ; but that I had not known him long
myself, though he was a friend of my aunt's.
168            THE PERSONAL H~STORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield," said Uriah. "Your aunt is a sweet
 lady, Master Copperfield ! "
    H e had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm, which
 was very ugly; and which diverted my attention from the compliment he
 had paid my relation, to the snaky twistings of his throat and body.
    " A sweet lady, Master Copperfield ! " said Uriah Heep. " She has a
 great admiration for Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield, I believe ? "
    I said "Yes," boldly; not that I knew anything about it, Heaven
 forgive me !
    " I hope you have, too, Master Copperfield," said Uriah.      " But I am

 sure you must have."
    " Everybody must have," I returned.
    " Oh, thank yon, Master Copperfield," said Uriah Heep, " for that
 remark ! I t is so true ! Umble as I am, I know it is so true ! Oh, thank
 you, Master Copperfield !"
    H e writhed himself quite off his stool in the excitement of his feelings,
and, being off, began to make arrangements for going home.
    " Mother will be expecting me,"       he said, referring to a pale, inex-
pressive-faced watch in his pocket, " and getting uneasy ; for though we are
very umble, Master Copperfield, we are much attached to one another.
If you would come and see us, any afternoon, and take a cup of tea at our
lowly dwelling, mother would be as proud of your company as I should be.
    I said I should be glad to come.
    "Thank you, Master Copperfield," returned Uriah, putting his book away
upon a shelf.-<' I suppose you stop here, some time, Master Copperfield ? "
    I said I was going to be brought up there, I believed, as long as I
remained at school.
    " Oh, indeed 1 " exclaimed Uriah. " I should think you would come
 into the business at last, Master Copperfield ! "
    I protested that I had no views of that sort, and that no such scheme
was entertained in my behalf by anybody ; but Uriah insisted on blandly
replying to all my assurances, "Oh, yes, Master Copperfield, I should
think you would, indeed!" and, "Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield, I
should think you would, certainly! " over and over again. Being, at last,
ready to leave the office for the night, he asked me if it would suit my
convenience to have the light put out ; and on my answering "Yes," in-
stantly extinguished it. After shaking hands with me-his hand felt like
a fish, in the dark-he opened the door into the street a very little, and
crept out, and shut it, leaving me to grope my way back into the house :
which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool. This was the
proximate cause, I suppose, of my dreaming about him, for what ap-
peared to me to be half the night; and dreaming, among other things,
that he had launched Mr. Peggotty's house on a piratical expedition, with
a black flag at the mast-head, bearing the inscription "Tidd's Practice,"
under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little Em'ly to the
Spanish Main, to be drowned.
   I got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school next day,
and a good deal the better next day, and so shook it off by degrees that
in less than a fortnight I was quite at home, and happy, among my new
companions. I was awkward enough in their games, and backward enough
in their studies ;but custom would improve me in the first respect, I hoped,

 and hard work in the second. Accordingly, I went to work very hard,
 both in play and in earnest, and gained great commendation. And, in a very
 little while, the Murdstone and Grinby life became so strange to me that I
 hardly believed init, while my present life grew so familiar, that I seemed
 to have been leading it a long time.
     Doctor Strong's was an excellent school; as different from Mr Creakle's
 as good is from evil. I t was very gravely and decorously ordered, and on
 a sound system; with an appeal, in everything, to the honour and good
faith of the boys, and an avowed intention to rely on their possession of
those qualities unless they proved themselves unworthy of it, which worked
wonders. We all felt that we had a part in the management of the place,
and in sustaining its character and dignity. Hence, we soon became
warmly attached to it-I am sure I did for one, and I never knew, in all
my time, of any other boy being otherwise-and learnt with a good will,
desiring to do it credit. We had noble games out of hours, and plenty of
liberty; but even then, as I remember, we were well spoken of in the town,
and rarely did any disgrace, by our appearance or manner, to the reputation
of Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong's boys.
     Some of the higher scholars boarded in the Doctor's house, and through
them I learnt, at second hand, some particulars of the Doctor's history-as
how he had not yet been married twelve months to the beautiful young lady
I had seen in the study, whom he had married for love ;as she had not a six-
pence, and had a world of poor relations (so our fellows said) ready to swarm
the Doctor out of house and home. Also, how the Doctor's cogitating
manner was attributable to his being always engaged in looking out for
Greek roots ; which, in my innocence and ignorance, 1 supposed to be a
botanical furor on the Doctor's part, especially as he always looked at the
ground when he walked about-until I understood that they were roots of
words, with a view to a new Dictionary, which he had in contemplation.
Adams, our head-boy, who had a turn for mathematics, had made a calcu-
lation, I was informed, of the time this Dictionary would take in completing,
on the Doctor's plan, and at the Doctor's rate of going. He considered
that it might be done in one thousand six hundred and forty-nine years,
counting from the Doctor's last, or sixty-second, birthday.
    But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school : and it must
have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else, for he
was the kindest of men; with a simple faith in him that might have
touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall. As he walked
up and down that part of the court-yard which was at the side of the
house, with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their
heads cocked slyly, as if they knew how much more knowing they were in
worldly affairs than he, if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough
to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of
distress, that vagabond was made for the next two days. I t was so
notorious in the house, that the masters and head-boys took pains to
cut these marauders off at angles, and to get out of windows, and turn
them out of the court-yard, before they could make the Doctor aware of their
presence; which was sometimes happily effected within a few yards of
him, without his knowing anything of the matter, as he jogged to and fro.
Outside his own domain, and unprotected, he was a very sheep for the
shearers. He would have taken his gaiters off his legs, to give away. I n
170            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

fact, there was a story current among us ( I have no idea, and never had,
 on what authority, but I have believed it for so many years that I feel
 quite certain it is true), that on a frosty day, one winter time, he actually
 did bestow his gaiters on a beggar-woman, who occasioned some scandal
in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door,
wrapped in those garments, which were universally recognised, being as
well known in the vicinity as the Cathedral. The legend added that the
only person who did not identify them was the Doctor himself, who, when
they were shortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little second-hand
shop of no very good repute, where such things were taken in exchange for
 gin, was more than once observed to handle them approvingly, as if admiring
some curious novelty in the pattern, and considering them an improvement
on his own.
    It was very pleasant to see the Doctor with his pretty young wife.
H e had a fatherly, benignant way of showing his fondness for her, which
 seemed in itself to express a good man. I often saw them walking in the
 garden where the peaches were, and I sometimes had a nearer observation
of them in the study or the parlor. She appeared to me to take great care
of the Doctor, and to like him very much, though I never thought her
vitally interested in the Dictionary : some cumbrous fragments of which
work the Doctor always carried in his pockets, and in the lining of his hat,
and generally seemed to be expounding to her as they walked about.
   I saw a good deal of Mrs. Strong, both because she had taken a liking
for me on the morning of my introduction to the Doctor, and was always
afterwards kind to me, and interested in me ; and because she was very
fond of Agnes, and was often backwards and forwards at our house.
There was a curious constraint between her and Mr. Wickfield, I thought
(of whom she seemed to be afraid), that never wore off. When she came
there of an evening, she always shrunk from accepting his escort home,
and ran away with me instead. And sometimes, as we were running gaily
across the Cathedral yard together, expecting to meet nobody, we would
meet Mr. Jack Maldon, who was always surprised to see us.
   Mrs. Strong's mama was alady I took great delight in. Her name was
Mrs. Markleham ;but our boys used to call her the Old Soldier, on account
of her generalship, and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of
relations against the Doctor. She was a little, sharp-eyed woman, who
used to wear, when she was dressed, one unchangeable cap, ornamented
with some artificial flowers, and two artificial butterflies supposed to be
hovering above the flowers. There was a superstition among us that this
cap had come from France, and could only originate in the workmanship
of that ingenious nation: but all I certainly know about it, is, that it
always made its appearance of an evening, wheresoever Mrs. Markle-
ham made her appearance ; that it was carried about to friendly meetings
in a Hindoo basket; that the butterflies had the gift of trembling
constantly; and that they improved the shining hours at Doctor Strong's
expense, like busy bees.
   I observed the Old Soldier-not to adopt the name disrespectfully-to
pretty good advantage, on a night which is made memorable to me by some-
thing else I shall relate. I t was the night of a little party at the Doctor's,
which was given on the occasion of Mr. Jack Maldon's departure for India,
whither he was going as a cadet, or something of that kind : Mr. Wickfield
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           171
 having at length arranged the business. I t happened to be the Doctor's
 birthday, too. We had had a holiday, had made presents to him in the
 morning, had made a speech to him through the head-boy, and had cheered
 him until we were hoarse, and until he had shed tears. And now, in the
 evening, Mr. WickfieId, Agnes, and I, went to have tea with him in his
private capacity.
    Mr. Jack Maldon was there, before us. Mrs. Strong, dressed in white,
 with cherry-colored ribbons, was playing the piano, when we went in ; and
he was leaning over her to turn the leaves. The clear red and white of
her complexion was not so blooming and flower-like as usual, I thought,
when she turned round ; but she looked very pretty, wonderfully pretty.
    " I have forgotten, Doctor," said Mrs. Strong's mama, when we were
 seated, " to pay you the compliments of the day-though they are, as you
may suppose, very far from being mere compliments in my case. Allow
me to wish you many happy returns."
    " I thank you, ma'am," replied the Doctor.
    " Many, many, many, happy returns," said the Old Soldier. "Not only
 for your own sake, but for Annie's, and John Maldon's, and many other
peoples'. I t seems but yesterday to me, John, when you were a little
 creature, a head shorter than Master Copperfield, making baby love to
Annie behind the gooseberry bushes in the back-garden."
    " My dear mama," said Mrs. Strong, "never mind that now."
    "Annie, don't be absurd," returned her mother. "If you are to blush
to hear of such things, now you are an old married woman, when are you
not to blush to hear of them?"
    " Old ? " exclaimed Mr. Jack Maldon. "Annie ? Come ! "
    "Yes, John," returned the Soldier. "Virtually, an old married woman.
Although not old by years-for when did you ever hear me say, or who
has ever heard me say, that a girl of twenty was old by years!-your
cousin is the wife of the Doctor, and, as such, what I have described her. It
is well for you, John, that your cousin is the wife of the Doctor. You have
found in him an influential and kind friend, who will be kinder yet, I venture
to predict, if you deserve it. I have no false pride. I never hesitate to
admit, frankly, that there are some members of our family who want a friend.
You were one yourself, before your cousin's influence raised up one for you."
    The Doctor, in the goodness of his heart, waved his hand as if to make
light of it, and save Mr. Jack Maldon from any further reminder. But
Mrs. Markleham changed her chair for one next the Doctor's, and putting
her fan on his coat-sleeve, said :
    "No, really, my dear Doctor, you must excuse me if I appear to dwell
on this rather, because I feel so very strongly. I call it quite my mono-
mania, it is such a subject of mine. You are a blessing to us. You really
are a Boon, you know."
    " Nonsense, nonsense," said the Doctor.
    " No, no, I beg your pardon," retorted the Old Soldier. " With nobody
present, but our dear and confidential friend Mr. Wickfield, I cannot consent
to be put down. I shall begin to assert the privileges of a mother-in-law,
if you go on like that, and scold you. I am perfectly honest and outspoken.
What I am saying, is what I said when you first overpowered me with
surprise-you remember how surprised I was ?-by proposing for Annie.
Not that there was anything so very much out of the way, in the mere
173           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 act of the proposal-it would be ridiculous to say that!-but because, you
having known her poor father, and having known her from a baby six
months old, I hadn't thought of you in such a light at all, or indeed as a
marrying man in any way,-simply that, you know."
   "Aye, aye," returned the Doctor, good-humoredly. " Never mind."
   "But I do mind," said the Old Soldier, laying her fan upon his lips.
"I mind very much. I recal these things that I may be contradicted if I
am wrong. Well! Then I spoke to Annie, and I told her what had
happened. I said, 'My dear, here's Doctor Strong has positively been
and made you the subject of a handsome declaration and an offer.' Did
I press it in the least? No. I said, ' Now, Annie, tell me the truth
this moment; is your heart free ? ' ' Mama,' she said, crying, ' I a m
extremely young '-which was perfectly true-' and I hardly know if I
have a heart at all.' ' Then, my dear,' I said, ' you may rely upon it,
it's free. At all events, my love,' said I, 'Doctor Strong is in an
agitated state of mind, and must be answered. He cannot be kept in his
present state of suspense.' 'Mama,' said Annie, still crying, ' would he
be unhappy without me? If he would, I honor and respect him so
much, that I think I will have him.' So it was settled. And then, and
not till then, I said to Annie, 'Annie, Doctor Strong will not only be
your husband, but he will represent your late father : he will represent the
head of our family, he will represent the wisdom and station, and I may
say the means, of our family; and will be, in short, a Boon to it! I used
the word at the time, and I have used it again, to-day. If I have any
merit, it is consistency."
   The daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech, with her
eyes fixed on the ground ; her cousin standing near her, and looking on
the ground too. She now said very softly, in a trembling voice :
   " Mama, I hope you have finished? "
   "No, my dear Annie," returned the Soldier, " I have not quite finished.
 Since you ask me, my love, I reply that I have aot. I complain that you
really are a little unnatural towards your own family; and, as it is of no
use complaining to you, I mean to complain to your husband. Now, my
dear Doctor, do look at that silly wife of yours."
   As the Doctor turned his kind face, with its smile of simplicity and
gentleness, towards her, she drooped her head more. I noticed that Mr.
Wickfield looked at her steadily.
   "When I happened to say to that naughty thing, the other day," pur-
 sued her mother, shaking her head and her fan at her, playfully, " that
there was a family circumstance she might mention to you-indeed, I
think, was bound to mention-she said, that to mention it was to ask a
favor; and that, as you were too generous, and as for her to ask was
always to have, she wouldn't."
   " Annie, my dear," said the Doctor. " That was wrong. I t robbed
me of a pleasure."
   "Almost the very words I said to her ! " exclaimed her mother.
"Now really, another time, when I know what she would tell you but
for this reason, and won't, I have a great mind, my dear Doctor, to tell
you myself."
   " I shall be glad if you will," returned the Doctor.

    " Shall I ? "
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

  " Certainly."
    " Well, then, I will ! " said the Old Soldier. "That's a bargain."
And having, I suppose, carried her point, she tapped the Doctor's hand
several times with her fan (which she kissed first), and returned
triumphantly to her former station.
    Some more company coming in, among whom were the two masters
and Adams, the talk became general; and it naturally turned on Mr.
Jack Maldon, and his voyage, and the country he was going to, and his
various plans and prospects. He was to leave that night, after supper,
in a postchaise, for Gravesend ; where the ship, in which he was to make
the voyage, lay; and was to be gone-unless he came home on leave, or
for his health-I don't know how many years. I recollect it was settled
by general consent that India was quite a misrepresented country, and
had nothing objectionable in it, but a tiger or two, and a little heat in the
warm part of the day. For my own part, I looked on Mr. Jack Maldon
as a modern Sinbad, and pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs
in the east, sitting under canopies, smoking curly golden pipes-a mile
long, if they could be straightened out.
    Mrs. Strong was a very pretty singer : as I knew, who often heard her
singing by herself. But, whether she was afraid of singing before people,
or was out of voice that evening, it was certain that she couldn't sing at
all. She tried a duet, once, with her cousin Maldon, but could not so
much as begin ; and afterwards, when she tried to sing by herself, although
she began sweetly, her voice died away on a sudden, and left her quite
distressed, with her head hanging down over the keys. The good Doctor
said she was nervous, and, to relieve her, proposed a round game at cards ;
of which he knew as much as of the art of playing the trombone. But I
remarked that the Old Soldier took him into custody directly, for her
partner; and instructed him, as the first preliminary of initiation, to give
her all the silver he had in his pocket.
    We had a merry game, not made the less merry by the Doctor's
mistakes, of which he committed an innumerable quantity, in spite of the
watchfulness of the butterflies, and to their great aggravation. Mrs. Strong
had declined to play, on the ground of not feeling very well; and her
cousin Maldon had excused himself because he had some packing to do.
When he had done it, however, he returned, and they sat together, talking,
on the sofa. From time to time she came and looked over the Doctor's
hand, and told him what to play. She was very pale, as she bent over
him, and I thought her finger trembled as she pointed out the cards ; but
the Doctor was quite happy in her attention, and took no notice of this,
if it were so.
    At supper, we were hardly so gay. Every one appeared to feel that a
parting of that sort was an awkward thing, and that the nearer it
approached, the more awkward it was. Mr. Jack Maldon tried to be
very talkative, but was not at his ease, and made matters worse. And
they were not improved, as it appeared to me, by the Old Soldier: who
continually recalled passages of Mr. Jack Maldon's youth.
    The Doctor, however, who felt, I am sure, that he was making every-
body happy, was well pleased, and had no suspicion, but that we were all
at the utmost height of enjoyment.
    " Annie, my dear," said he, looking at his watch, and filling his
174            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 glass, "it is past your cousin Jack's time, and we must not detain
him, since time and tide-both concerned in this case-wait for no man.
 Mr. Jack Maldon, you have a long voyage, and a strange country, before you ;
 but many men have had both, and many men will have both, to the end of
 time. The winds you are going to tempt, have wafted thousands upon
 thousands to fortune, and brought thousands upon thousands happily back."
    " I t 's an affecting thing," said Mrs. Markleham-"  however it 's viewed,
it's affecting-to see a fine young man one has known from an infant,
going away to the other end of the world, leaving all he knows behind, and
not knowing what's before him. A young man really well deserves
constant support and patronage," looking at the Doctor, "who makes
such sacrifices."
    " Time will go fast with you, Mr. Jack Maldon," pursued the Doctor,
" and fast with all of us. Some of us can hardly expect, perhaps, in the
natural course of things, to greet you on your return. The next best
thing is to hope to do it, and that's my case. I shall not weary you
with good advice. You have long had a good model before you, in your
cousin Annie. Imitate her virtues as nearly as you can."
   Mrs. Markleham fanned herself, and shook her head.
    " Farewell, Mr. Jack," said the Doctor, standing up ; on which we all

stood up. "A prosperous voyage out, a thriving career abroad, and a
happy return home ! "
    We all drank the toast, and all shook hands with Mr. Jack Maldon;
after which he hastily took leave of the ladies who were there, and hurried
to the door, where he was received, as he got into the chaise, with a tre-
mendous broadside of cheers discharged by our boys, who had assembled on
the lawn for the purpose. Running in among them to swell the ranks, I was
very near the chaise when it rolled away; and I had a lively impression made
upon me, in the midst of the noise and dust, of having seen Mr. Jack Maldon
rattle past with an agitated face, and something cherry-colored in his hand.
    After another broadside for the Doctor, and another for the Doctor's
wife, the boys dispersed, and I went back into the house, where I found the
 guests all standing in a group about the Doctor, discussing how Mr. Jack
 Maldon had gone away, and how he had borne it, and how he had felt it,
and all the rest of it. I n the midst of these remarks, Mrs. Markleham
cried : " Where 's Annie ! "
   No Annie was there; and when they called to her, no Annie replied.
But all pressing out of the room, in a crowd, to see what was the matter,
we found her lying on the hall floor. There was great alarm at first, until
it was found that she was in a swoon, and that the swoon was yielding to
the usual means of recovery; when the Doctor, who had lifted her head
upon his knee, put her curls aside with his hand, and said, looking
around :
   " Poor Annie ! She 's so faithful and tender-hearted !    I t 's the parting
from her old playfellow and friend-her favorite cousin-that has done
this. Ah ! It 's a pity ! I am very sorry ! "
   When she opened her eyes, and saw where she was, and that we
were all standing about her, she arose with assistance : turning her head,
as she did so, to lay it on the Doctor's shoulder-or to hide it, I
don't know which. We went into the drawing-room, to leave her with the
Doctor and her mother; but she said, it seemed, that she was better than
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            175
she had been since morning, and that she would rather be brought among
us; so they brought her in, looking very white and weak, I thought, and
sat her on a sofa.
    "Annie, my dear," said her mother, doing something to her dress.
" See here !   You have lost a bow. Will anybody be so good as find a
ribbon ; a cherry-colored ribbon ? "
   I t was the one she had worn a t her bosom. We d l looked for it-I
myself looked everywhere, I am certain-but nobody could find it.
    " Do you recollect where you had it last, Annie? " said her mother.
   I wondered how I could have thought she looked white, or anything
but burning red, when she answered that she had had it safe, a little while
ago, she thought, but it was not worth looking for.
   Nevertheless, it was looked for again, and still not found. She
entreated that there might be no more searching; but it was still sought
for, in a desultory way, until she was quite well, and the company took
their departure.
   We walked very slowly home, Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, and I-Agnes
and I admiring the moonlight, and Mr. Wickfield scarcely raising his
eyes from the ground. When we, at last, reached our own door, Agnes
discovered that she had left her little reticule behind. Delighted to be of
any service to her, I ran back to fetch it.
    I went into the supper-room where it had been left, which was deserted
and dark. But a door of communication between that and the Doctor's
study, where there was a light, being open, I passed on there, to say
what I wanted, and to get a candle.
   The Doctor was sitting in his easy chair by the fireside, and his young
wife was on a stool at his feet. The Doctor, with a complacent smile, was
reading aloud some manuscript explanation or statement of a theory out
of that interminable Dictionary, and she was looking up at him. But, with
such a face as I never saw. I t was so beautiful in its form, it was so
ashy pale, it was so fixed in its abstraction, it was so full of a wild, sleep-
walking, dreamy horror of I don't know what. The eyes were wide open,
and her brown hair fell in two rich clusters on her shoulders, and on her
white dress, disordered by the want of the lost ribbon. Distinctly as I
recollect her look, I cannot say of what it was expressive. I cannot even
say of what it is expressive to me now, rising again before my older
judgment. Penitence, humiliation, shame, pride, love, and trustfulness-
 I see them all; and in them all, I see that horror of I don't know what.
    My entrance, and my saying what I wanted, roused her. It disturbed
the Doctor too, for when I went back to replace the candle I had taken
from the table, he was patting her head, in his fatherly way, and saying
he was a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading on; and he
would have her go to bed.
    But she asked him, in a rapid, urgent manner, to let her stay-to let
her feel assured (I heard her murmur some broken words to this effect) that
she was in his confidence that night. And, as she turned again towards
him, after glancing at me as I left the room and went out at the door, I
saw her cross her hands upon his knee, and look up at him with the same
face, something quieted, as he resumed his reading.
    I t made a great impression on me, and I remembered it a long time
afterwards ; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes.
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                            CHAPTER XVII.
                           SOMEBODY TURNS UP.

   IThas not occurred to me to mention Peggotty since I ran away; but,
of course, I wrote her a letter almost as soon as I was housed at Dover,
and another, and a longer letter, containing all particulars fully related,
when my aunt took me formally under her protection. On my being
settled at Doctor Strong's I wrote to her again, detailing my happy con-
dition and prospects. I never could have derived anything like the
pleasure from spending the money Mr. Dick had given me, that I felt
in sending a gold half-guinea to Peggotty, per post, inclosed in this last
letter, to discharge the sum I had borrowed of her : in which epistle, not
before, I mentioned about the young man with the donkey-cart.
   To these communications Peggotty replied as promptly, if not as con-
cisely, as a merchant's clerk. Her utmost powers of expression (which
were certainly not great in ink) were exhausted in the attempt to write
what she felt on the subject of my journey. Four sides of incoherent and
interjectional begrnnings of sentences, that had no end, except blots, were
inadequate to afford her any relief. But the blots were more expressive
to me than the best composition; for they showed me that Peggotty had
been crying all over the paper, and what could I have desired more?
   I made out, without much difficulty, that she could not take quite
kindly to my aunt yet. The notice was too short after so long a prepos-
session the other way. We never knew a person, she wrote; but to
think that Miss Betsey should seem to be so different from what she had
been thought to be, was a Moral !-that was her word. She was evidently
still afraid of Miss Betsey, for she sent her grateful duty to her but timidly;
and she was evidently afraid of me, too, and entertained the probability of
my running away again soon : if I might judge from the repeated hints she
threw out, that the coach-fare to Yarmouth was always to be had of her
for the asking.
   She gave me one piece of intelligence which affected me very much,
namely, that there had been a sale of the furniture at our old home, and
that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were gone away, and the house was shut
up, to be let or sold. God knows I had had no part in it while they
remained there, but it pained me to think of the dear old place as
altogether abandoned ; of the weeds growing tall in the garden, and the
fallen leaves lying thick and wet upon the paths. I imagined how the
winds of winter would howl round it, how the cold rain would beat upon
the window-glass, how the moon would make ghosts on the walls of the
empty rooms, watching their solitude all night. I thought afresh of the
grave in the churchyard, underneath the tree: and it seemed as if the
house were dead too, now, and all connected with my father and mother
were faded away.
   There was no other news in Peggotty's letters. Mr. Barkis was an
excellent husband, she said, though still a little near; but we all had our
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           177
faults, and she had plenty (though I am sure I don't know what they
were) ; and he sent his duty, and my little bedroom was always ready for
me. Mr. Peggotty was well, and Ham was well, and Mrs. Gummidge
 was but poorly, and little Em'ly wouldn't send her love, but said that
 Peggotty might send it, if she liked.
     All this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt, only reserving to
 myself the mention of little Em'ly, to whom I instinctively felt that
 she would not very tenderly incline. While I was yet new at Doctor
  Strong's, she made several excursions over to Canterbury to see me, and
 always at unseasonable hours : with the view, I suppose, of taking me by
 surprise. But, finding me well employed, and bearing a good character, and
 hearing on all hands that I rose fast in the school, she soon discontinued
 these visits. I saw her on a Saturday, every third or fourth week, when I
went over to Dover for a treat ; and I saw Mr. Dick every alternate Wednes-
day, when he arrived by stage-coach at noon, to stay until next morning.
     On these occasions Mr. Dick never travelled without a leathern writing-
desk, containing a supply of stationery and the Memorial; in relation to
which document he had a notion that time was beginning to press now,
and that it really must be got out of hand.
    Mr. Dick was very partial to gingerbread. To render his visits the
 more agreeable, my aunt had instructed me to open a credit for him at a
cake-shop, which was hampered with the stipulation that he should not
be served with more than one shilling's-worth in the course of any one
day. This, and the reference of all his little bills at the county inn where
h e slept, to my aunt, before they were paid, induced me to suspect that
he was only allowed to rattle his money, and not to spend it. I found on
further investigation that this was so, or at least there was an agreement
between him and my aunt that he should account to her for all his
disbursements. As he had no idea of deceiving her, and always desired to
please her, he was thus made chary of launching into expense. On this
point, as well as on all other possible points, Mr. Dick was convinced that
my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful of women; as he repeatedly
told me with infinite secresy, and always in a whisper.
    "Trotwood," said Mr. Dick, with an air of mystery, after imparting
this confidence to me, one Wednesday ; "who's the man that hides near
our house and frightens her."
    " Frightens my aunt, sir ? "

    Mr. Dick nodded. " I thought nothing would have frightened her,"
he said, "for she 's-"     here he whispered softly, " don't mention it-the
wisest and most wonderful of women." Having said which, he drew
back, to observe the effect which this description of her made upon me.
    "The first time he came," said Mr. Dick, " was-let me see-sixteen
hundred and forty-nine was the date of King Charles's execution. J
think vou said sixteen hundred and forty-nine ? "
    " yes, sir."
    "I don't know how it can be," said Mr. Dick, sorely puzzled and
shaking his head. " I don't think I am as old as that."
    "Was it in that year that the man appeared, sir ? " I asked.
    "Why, really," said Mr. Dick, " I don't see how it can have been in
that year, Trotwood. Did you get that date out of history? "
    "Yes, sir."                                                 N
178            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " I suppose history never lies, does it ?" said Mr. Dick, with a gleam
of hope.
    " Oh dear, no, sir ! " I replied, most decisively. I was ingenuous and
young, and I thought so.
    " I can't make it out," said Mr. Dick, shaking his head. " There's
something wrong, somewhere. However, it was very soon after the
mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of King Charles's
head into my head, that the man first came. I was walking out with Miss
Trotwood after tea, just at dark, and there he was, close to our house."
    " Walking about ? " I inquired.
    " Walking about ? " repeated Mr. Dick. "Let me see. I must recol-
lect a bit. N-no, no ; he was not walking about."
    I asked, as the shortest way to get at it, what he mas doing.
    " Well, he wasn't there at all," said Mr. Dick, "until he came up behind
her, and whispered. Then she turned round and fainted, and I stood still
and looked at him, and he walked away ; but that he should have been hiding
ever since (in the ground or somewhere), is the most extraordinary thing!"
    " Haa he been hiding ever since? " I asked.
    " To be sure he has," retorted Mr. Dick, nodding his head gravely.

" Never came out, till last night ! We were walking last night, and he
came up behind her again, and I knew him again."
    " And did he frighten my aunt again? "
    " All of a shiver,"   said Mr. Dick, counterfeiting that affection and
making his teeth chatter. '< Held by the palings. Cried. But Trotwood,
come here," getting me close to him, that he might whisper very softly;
" why did she give him money, boy, in the moonlight ? "
    " H e was a beggar, perhaps."
    Mr. Dick shook his head, as utterly renouncing the suggestion; and
having replied a great many times, and with great confidence, " No
beggar, no beggar, no beggar, sir ! " went on to say, that from his window
he had afterwards, and late at night, seen my aunt give this person money
outside the garden rails in the moonlight, who then slunk away-into the
ground again, as he thought probable-and was seenno more: while my aunt
came hurriedly and secretly back into the house, and had, even that morning,
been quite different from her usual self; which preyed on Mr. Dick's mind.
    I had not the least belief, in the outset of this story, that the unknown
was anything but a delusion of Mr. Dick's, and one of the line of that
ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty; but after some re-
flection I began to entertain the question whether an attempt, or threat of an
attempt, might have been twice made to take poor Mr. Dick himself from
under my aunt's protection, and whether my aunt, the strength of whose
kind feeling towards him I knew from herself, might have been induced
to pay a price for his peace and quiet. As I was already much attached to
Mr. Dick, and very solicitous for his welfare, my fears favored this sup-
position; and for a long time his Wednesday hardly ever came round,
without my entertaining a misgiving that he would not be on the coach-
box as usual. There he always appeared, however, grey-headed, laughing,
and happy; and he never had anything more to tell of the man who
could frighten my aunt.
    These Wednesdays were the happiest days of Mr. Dick's life; they were
far from being the least happy of mine. He soon became known to every
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           179
boy in the school; and though he never took an active part in any game
but kite-flying, was as deeply interested in all our sports as any one among
us. How often have I seen him, intent upon a match at marbles or
pegtop, looking on with a face of unutterable interest, and hardly breathing
at the critical times ! How often, at hare and hounds, have I seen him
mounted on a little knoll, cheering the whole field on to action, and waving
his hat above his grey head, oblivious of King Charles the Martyr's head,
and all belonging to it ! How many a summer-hour have I known to be but
blissful minutes to him in the cricket-field ! How many winter days have I
seen him, standing blue-nosed in the snow and east wind, looking at the
boys going down the long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture!
    He was an universal favorite, and his ingenuity in little things was
transcendant. He could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had
an idea of. He could make a boat out of anything, from a skewer
upwards. He could turn crampbones into chessmen; fashion Roman
chariots from old court cards ; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels,
and birdcages of old wire. But he was greatest of all, perhaps, in the
articles of string and straw ; with which we were all persuaded he could
do anything that could be done by hands.
    Mr. Dick's renown was not long confined to us. After a few Wednes-
days, Doctor Strong himself made some inquiries of me about him, and I
told him all my aunt had told me ; which interested the Doctor so much
that he requested, on the occasion of his next visit, to be presented to
him. This ceremony I performed ; and the Doctor begging Mr. Dick,
whensoever he should not find me at the coach-office, to come on there,
and rest himself until our morning's work was over, it soon passed into a
custom for Mr. Dick to come on as a matter of course, and, if we were a
little late, as often happened on a Wednesday, to walk about the court-
yard, waiting for me. Here he made the acquaintance of the Doctor's
beautiful young wife (paler than formerly, all this time ; more rarely seen
by me or any one, I think; and not so gay, but not less beautiful), and so
became more and more familiar by degrees, until, at last, he would come
into the school and wait. H e always sat in a particular corner, on a par-
ticular stool, which was called "Dick," after him; here he would sit, with his
grey head bent forward, attentively listening to whatever might be going on,
with a profoundveneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire.
    This veneration Mr. Dick extended to the Doctor, whom he thought
the most subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age. I t was long
before Mr. Dick ever spoke to him otherwise than bare-headed; and even
when he and the Doctor had struck up quite a friendship, and would walk
together by the hour, on that side of the courtyard which was known
among us as The Doctor's Walk, Mr. Dick would pull off his hat at
intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge. How it ever
came about, that the Doctor began to read out scraps of the famous
Dictionary, in these walks, I never knew ; perhaps he felt it all the same,
at first, as reading to himself. However, it passed into a custom too ; and
Mr. Dick, listening with a face shining with pride and pleasure, in his heart
of hearts believed the Dictionary to be the most delightful book in the world.
   As I think of them going up and down before those school-room
windows-the Doctor reading with his complacent smile, an occasional
                                      N 2

flourish of the manuscript, or grave motion of his head; and Mr. Dick
listening, enchained by interest, with his poor wits calmly wandering God
knows where, upon the wings of hard words-I think of it as one of the
pleasantest things, in a quiet way, that I have ever seen. I feel as if they
might go walking to and fro for ever, and the world might somehow be
the better for it-as if a thousand things it makes a noise about, were not
one-half so good for it, or me.
   Agnes was one of Mr. Dick's friends, very soon ; and in often coming to
the house, he made acquaintance withuriah. The friendship between him-
self and me increased continually, and it was maintained on this odd footing :
that, while Mr. Dick came professedly to look after me as my guardian, he
always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that arose, and invariably
guided himself by my advice ; not only having a high respect for my native
 sagacity, but considering that I inherited a good deal from my aunt.
    OneThursday morning, when I was about to walk with Mr. Dick from the
hotel to the coach-office before going back to school (for we had an hour's
school beforebreakfast),ImetUriah in the street, who remindedme of the pro-
miseIhad made to taketeawith himself and his mother: adding, with awrithe,
"But Ididn't expect you to keep it,Master Copperfield, we're so very umble."
   I really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked
Uriah or detested him; and I was very doubtful about it still, as I stood
looking him in the face in the street. But I felt it quite an affront to
be supposed proud, and said I only wanted to be asked.
   " Oh, if that's all, Master Copperfield," said Uriah, "and it really isn't
our umbleness that prevents you, will you come this evening? But if it
is our umbleness, I hope you won't mind owning to it, Master Copperfield;
for we are well aware of our condition."
   I said I would mention it to Mr. Wickfield, and if he approved, as I had no
doubt he would, I would come with pleasure. So, at six o'clock that evening,
which was one of the early office evenings, I announced myself as ready,
to Uriah.
   " Mother will be proud indeed," he said, as we walked away together.
"Or she would be proud, if it wasn't sinful, Master Copperfield."
   " Yet you didn't mind supposing I w a s proud this morning," I returned.
   " Oh dear no, Master Copperfield ! " returned Uriah. " Oh, believe me,
no ! Such a thought never came into my head ! I shouldn't have deemed
it at all proud if you had thought us too umble for you. Because we are
so very umble."
   "Have you been studying much law lately?" Iasked,to change the subject.
    " Oh, Master Copperfield," he said, with an air of self-denial, " my reading

is hardly to be called study. I have passed an hour or two in the evening,
sometimes, with Mr. Tidd."
    " Rather hard, I suppose ? " said I.

   " He is hard to me sometimes," returned Uriah. "But I don't know
what he might be, to a gifted person."
   After beating a little tune on his chin as we walked on, with the two
fore-fingers of his skeleton right hand, he added :
   " There are expressions, you see, Master Copperfield-Latin words and
terms-in Mr. Tidd, that are trying to a reader of my umble attainments."
   " Would you like to be taught Latin? " I said, briskly.        " I will teach
it you with pleasure, as I learn it."
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           181
   " Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield," he answered, shaking his head.
" I am sure it's very kind of you to make the offer, but I am much too
 umble to accept it."
        What nonsense, Uriah ! "
     " Oh, indeed you must excuse me, Master Copperfield ! I am greatly
 obliged, and I should like it of all things, I assure you; but I am far too
 umble. There are people enough to tread upon me in my lowly state,
 without my doing outrage to their feelings by possessing learning.
 Learning ain't for me. A person like myself had better not aspire. If he
 is to get on in life, he must get on umbly, Master Copperfield."
    I never saw his mouth so wide, or the creases in his cheeks so deep, as
 when he delivered himself of these sentiments : shaking his head all the
 time, and writhing modestly.
    " I think you are wrong, Uriah," I said. " I dare say there are several
 things that I could teach you, if you would like to learn them."
    " Oh, I don't doubt that, Master Copperfield," he answered; "not in
 the least. But not being umble yourself, you don't judge well, perhaps,
 for them that are. I won't provoke my betters with knowledge, thank you.
 I 'm much too umble. Here is my umble dwelling, Master Copperfield !       J J




    We entered a low, old-fashioned room, walked straight into from the
 street, and found there, Mrs. Heep, who was the dead image of Uriah,
 only short. She received me with the utmost humility, and apologised
to me for giving her son a kiss, observing that, lowly as they were, they
had their natural affections, which they hoped would give no offence to
any one. I t was a perfectly decent room, half parlor and half kitchen, but
not at all a snug room. The tea-things were set upon the table, and the
kettle was boiling on the hob. There was a chest of drawers with an escru-
toire top, for Uriah to read or write at of an evening; there was Uriah's blue
bag lying down and vomiting papers; there was a company of Uriah's books,
 commanded by Mr. Tidd; there was a corner cupboard; and there were the
usual articles of furniture. I don't remember that any individual object had
a bare, pinched, spare look ; but I do remember that the whole place had.
    I t was perhaps a part of Mrs. Heep's humility, that she still wore weeds.
Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had occurred since Mr. Heep's
decease, she still wore weeds. I think there was some compromise in the
cap ; but otherwise she was as weedy as in the early days of her mourning.
    " This is a day to be remembered, my Uriah, I am sure," said Mrs.
Heep, making the tea, "when Master Copperfield pays us a visit."
    "I said you 'd think so, mother," said Uriah.
    "If I could have wished father to remain among us for any reason,"
said Mrs. Heep, "it would have been, that he might have known his com-
pany this afternoon."
    I felt embarrassed by these compliments ; but I was sensible, too, of
being entertained as an honored guest, and I thought Mrs. Heep an
agreeable woman.
    " My Uriah," said Mrs. Heep, "has looked forward to this, sir, a long
while. He had his fears that our umbleness stood in the way, and I joined
in them myself. Umble we are, umble we have been, umble we shall
ever be," said Mrs. Heep.
    " I am sure you have no occasion to be so, ma'am," I said, " unless you
like."
182            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     "Thank you, sir," retorted Mrs. Heep. "We know our station and
 are thankful in it."
     Ifound that Mrs. Heep gradually got nearer to me, and that Uriah gra-
 dually got opposite to me, and that theyrespectfullyplied mewith the choicest
 of the eatables on the table. There was nothing particularly choice there, to
 be sure; but I took the will for the deed, and felt that they were very attentive.
 Presently they began to talk about aunts, and then I told them about mine ;
 and about fathers and mothers, and then I told them about mine ; and then
 Mrs. Heep began to talk about fathers-in-law, and then I began to tell her
 about mine-but stopped, because my aunt had advised me to observe a
 silence on that subject. A tender young cork, however, would have had no
 more chance against a pair of corkscrews, or a tender young tooth against a
 pair of dentists, or a little shuttlecock against two battledores, than I had
  against Uriah and Mrs. Heep. They did just what they liked with me ; and
 wormed things out of me that I had no desire to tell, with a certainty I
 blush to think of: the more especially as, in my juvenile frankness, I took
 some credit to myself for being so ccnfidential, and felt that I was quite
 the patron of my two respectful entertainers.
    They were very fond of one another : that was certain. I take it that
had its effect upon me, as a touch of nature ; but the skill with which the
 one followed up whatever the other said, was a touch of art which I was
 still less proof against. When there was nothing more to be got out of
 me about myself (for on the Murdstone and Grinby life, and on my journey,
 I was dumb), they began about Mr. Wickfield and Agnes. Uriah threw
 the ball to Mrs. Heep, Mrs. Heep caught it and threw it back to Uriah,
 Uriah kept it up a little while, then sent it back to Mrs. Heep, and so
 they went on tossing it about until I had no idea who had got it, and was
 quite bewildered. The ball itself was always changing too. Now it was
 Mr. Wickfield, now Agnes, now the excellence of Mr. Wickfield, now my
 admiration of Agnes; now the extent of Mr. Wickfield's business and
 resources, now our domestic life after dinner; now, the wine that Mr.
 Wickfield took, the reason why he took it, and the pity that it was he took
 so much ;now one thing, now another, then everything at once ; and all
the time, without appearing to speak very often, or to do anything but
 sometimes encourage them a little, for fear they should be overcome by
 their humility and the honor of my company, I found myself perpetually
 letting out something or other that I had no business to let out, and
 seeing the effect of it in the twinkling of Uriah's dinted nostrils.
    I had begun to be a little uncomfortable, and to wish myself well out of
 the visit, when a figure coming down the street passed the door-it
stood open to air the room, which was warm, the weather being close for the
time of year-came back again, looked in, and walked in, exclaiming
loudly, " Copperfield ! I s it possible ! "
    I t was Mr. Micawber ! I t was Mr. Micawber, with his eye-glass, and
his walking-stick, and his shirt-collar, and his genteel air, and the con-
descending roll in his voice, all complete !
    "My dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, putting out his hand,
"this is indeed a meeting which is calculated to impress the mind with
a sense of the instability and uncertainty of all human-in short, it is a
most extraordinary meeting. Walking along the street, reflecting upon
the probability of something turning up (of which I am at present rather
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            183
sanguine), I find a young, but valued friend turn up, who is connected with
the most eventful period of my life; I may say, with the turning point of
my existence. Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?"
   I cannot say-I really cannot say-that I was glad to see Mr. Micawber
there ; but I was glad to see him too, and shook hands with him heartily,
inquiring how Mrs. Micawber was.
   " Thank you," said Mr. Micawber, waving his hand as of old, and
settling his chin in his shirt-collar. " She is tolerably convalescent. The
twins no longer derive their sustenance from Nature's founts-in short,"
said Mr. Micawber, in one of his bursts of confidence, "they are weaned
-and Mrs. Micawber is, at present, my travelling companion. She will
be rejoiced, Copperfield, to renew her acquaintance with one who has proved
himself in all respects a worthy minister at the sacred altar of friendship."
   I said I should be delighted to see her.
   " You are very good," said Mr. Micawber.

   Mr. Micawber then smiled, settled his chin again, and looked about him.
   " I have discovered my friend Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber gen-
teelly, and without addressing himself particularly to any one, "not in
solitude, but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady,
and one who is apparently her offspring-in short," said Mr. Micawber,
in another of his bursts of confidence, "her son. I shall esteem it an
honor to be presented."
   I could do no less, under these circumstances, than make Mr. Micawber
known to Uriah Heep and his mother ; which I accordingly did. As they
abased themselves before him, Mr. Micawber took a seat, and waved his
hand in his most courtly manner.
   " Any friend of my friend Copperfield's," said Mr. Micawber, " has a
personal claim upon myself."
   "We are too umble, sir," said Mrs. Heep, " my son and me, to be the
friends of Master Copperfield. H e has been so good as take his tea with us,
and we are thankful to him for his company ;also to you, sir, for your notice."
   " Ma'am," returned Mr. Micawber, with a bow, " you are very obliging:

and what are you doing, Copperfield? Still in the wine trade? "
   I was excessively anxious to get Mr. Micawber away; and replied, with
my hat in my hand, and a very red face I have no doubt, that I was a
pupil at Doctor Strong's.
   " A pupil? " said Mr. Micawber, raising his eyebrows. " I am ex-
tremely happy to hear it. Although a mind like my friend Copperfield's "
-to Uriah and Mrs. Heep-" does not require that cultivation which, with-
out his knowledge of men and things, it would require, still it is a rich soil
teeming with latent vegetation-in short," said Mr. Micawber, smiling, in
another burst of confidence, " it is an intellect capable of getting up the
classics to any extent."
   Uriah, with his long hands slowly twining over one another, made a
ghastly writhe from the waist upwards, to express his concurrence in this
estimation of me.
   " Shall we go and see Mrs. Micawber, sir? " I said, to get Mr. Micawber

away.
   "If you will do her that favor, Copperfield," replied Mr. Micawber,
rising. "I have no scruple in saying, in the presence of our friends here,
that I am a man who has, for some years, contended against the pressure
184           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 of pecuniary difficulties," I knew he was certain to say something of this
 kind ; he always would be so boastful about his difficulties. " Sometimes
 I have risen superior to my difficulties. Sometimes my difficulties have-
 in short, have floored me. There have been times when I have adminis-
 tered a succession of facers to them; there have been times when they
 have been too many for me, and I have given in, and said to Mrs. Micawber
 in the words of Cato, ' Plato, thou reasonest well. It's all up now. I can
 show fight no more.' But at no time of my life," said Mr. Micawber,
 "have I enjoyed a higher degree of satisfaction than in pouring my griefs
 (if I may describe difficulties, chiefly arising out of warrants of attorney
 and promissory notes at two and four months, by that word) into the
 bosom of my friend Copperfield."
     Mr.Micawber closed this handsome tribute by saying, "Mr. Heep!
 Good evening. Mrs. Heep ! Your servant," and then walking out with
 me in his most fashionable manner, making a good deal of noise on the
pavement with his shoes, and humming a tune as we went.
    I t was a little inn where Mr. Micawber put up, and he occupied a little
room in it, partitioned off from the commercial room, and strongly
flavored with tobacco smoke. I think it was over the kitchen, because
a warm greasy smell appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor,
 and there was a flabby perspiration on the walls. I know it was near the
bar, on account of the smell of spirits and gingling of glasses. Here, recum-
 bent on a small sofa, underneath a picture of a race-horse, with her head
 close to the fire, and her feet pushing the mustard off the dumb-waiter at
the other end of the room, was Mrs. Micawber, to whom Mr. Micawber
entered first, saying, " My dear, allow me to introduce to you a pupil of
Doctor Strong's."
    I noticed, by-the-by, that although Mr. Micawber was just as much
confused as ever about my age and standing, he always remembered, as a
genteel thing, that I was a pupil of Doctor Strong's.
    Mrs. Micawber was amazed, but very glad to see me. I was very glad
to see her too, and after an affectionate greeting on both sides, sat down
on the small sofa near her.
    " My dear,"     said Mr. Micawber, "if you will mention to Copperfield
what our present position is, which I have no doubt he will like to know, I
will go and look at the paper the while, and see whether any thing turns
up among the advertisements."
    "I thought you were at Plymouth, ma'am," I said to Mrs. Micawber, as
he went out.
     " My dear Master Copperfield," she replied, "we went to Plymouth."
     " To be on the spot," I hinted.
    "Just so," said Mrs. Micawber. " To be on the spot. But, the truth
is, talent is not wanted in the Custom House. The local influence of my
family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department,
for a man of Mr. Micawber's abilities. They would rather not have a man
of Mr. Micawber's abilities. He would only show the deficiency of the
others. Apart from which," said Mrs. Micawber, " I will not disguise
from you, my dear Master Copperfield, that when that branch of my family
which is settled in Plymouth became aware that Mr. Micawber was accom-
panied by myself, and by little Wilkins and his sister, and by the twins,
they did not receive him with that ardor which he might have expected,
                         OF DAVID COPPEBFIELD.                            185
being so newly released from captivity. I n fact," said Mrs. Micawber,
lowering her voice,-" this is between ourselves-our reception was cool."
    <'Dear me ! " I said.
    "Yes," said Mrs. Micawber. "It is truly painful to contemplate
mankind in such an aspect, Master Copperfield, but our reception was,
decidedly, cool. There is no doubt about it. I n fact, that branch of my
family which is settled in Plymouth became quite personal to Mr. Micawber,
before we had been there a week."
   I said, and thought, that they ought to be ashamed of themselves.
   '$ Still, so it was," continued Mrs. Micawber. "Under such circum-
stances, what could a man of Mr. Micawber's spirit do ? But one obvious
course was left. To borrow, of that branch of my family, the money to
return to London, and to return at any sacrifice."
   " Then you all came back again, ma'am? " I said.
   "We all came back again," replied Mrs. Micawber. " Since then, I
have consulted other branches of my family on the course which it is most
expedient for Mr.Micawber to take-for I maintain that he must take some
course, Master Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber, argumentatively. " I t is
clear that a family of six, not including a domestic, cannot live upon air."
   '< Certainly, ma'am," said I.
   " The opinion of those other branches of myfamily," pursued Mrs.Micaw-
ber," is, that Mr. Micawber should immediately turn his attention to coals."
   " To what, ma'am ? "
   "To coals," said Mrs. Micawber. "To the coal trade. Mr. Micawber
was induced to think, on inquiry, that there might be an opening for a man
of his talent in the Medway Coal Trade. Then, as Mr. Micawber very pro-
perly said, the first step to be taken clearly was, to come and see the Medway.
Which we came and saw. I say we,' Master Copperfield ; for I never will,"
said Mrs. Micawber with emotion, "I never will desert Mr. Micawber."
   I murmured my admiration and approbation.
    "We came," repeated Mrs. Micawber, "and saw the Medway. My
opinion of the coal trade on that river, is, that it may require talent, but
that it certainly requires capital. Talent, Mr. Micawber has ; capital,
Mr. Micawber has not. We saw, I think, the greater part of the Medway ;
and that is my individual conclusion. Being so near here, Mr. Micawber
was of opinion that it would be rash not to come on, and see the Cathedral.
Firstly, on account of its being so well worth seeing, and our never having
 seen it; and secondly, on account of the great probability of something
turning up in a cathedral town. We have been here," said Mrs. Micawber,
"three days. Nothing has, as yet, turned up ; and it may not surprise
you, my dear Master Copperfield, so much as it would a stranger, to know
that we are at present waiting for a remittance from London, to discharge
our pecuniary obligations at this hotel. Until the arrival of that remit-
tance,"said Mrs.Micawber, with much feeling," I am cut off from my home (I
allude to lodgings inpentonville), from my boy and girl, and from my twins."
   I felt the utmost sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in this anxious
extremity, and said as much to Mr. Micawber, who now returned : adding
that I only wished I had money enough, to lend them the amount they
needed. Mr. Micawber's answer expressed the disturbance of his mind.
H e said, shaking hands with me, " Copperfield, you are a true friend ;
but when the worst comes to the worst, no man is without a friend
186            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

who is possessed of shaving materials." At this dreadful hint Mrs.
Micawber threw her arms round Mr. Micawber's neck and entreated him
to be calm. H e wept; but so far recovered, almost immediately, as to
ring the bell for the waiter, and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate
of shrimps for breakfast in the morning.
   When I took my leave of them, they both pressed me so much to come
and dine before they went away, that I could not refuse. But, as I knew
I could not come next day, when I should have a good deal to prepare in the
evening, Mr. Micawber arranged that he would call at Doctor Strong's in
the course of the morning (having a presentiment that the remittance
would arrive by that post), and propose the day after, if it would suit me
better. Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon, and found
Mr. Micawber in the parlor; who had called to say that the dinner would
take place as proposed. When I asked him if the remittance had come,
he pressed my hand and departed.
   As I was looking out of window that same evening, it surprised me, and
made me rather uneasy, to see Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walk past,
arm in arm : Uriah humbly sensible of the honor that was done him, and
Mr. Micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to Uriah.
But I was still more surprised, when I went to the little hotel next day at
the appointed dinner hour, which was four o'clock, to find, from what Mr.
Micawber said, that he had gone home with Uriah, and had drunk brandy-
and-water at Mrs. Heep's.
   "And I'll tell you what, my dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber,
"your friend Heep is a young fellow who might be attorney-general. If
I had known that young man, at the period when my difficulties came to a
crisis, all I can say is, that I believe my creditors would have been a great
deal better managed than they were."
   I hardly understood how this could have been, seeing that Mr. Micawber
had paid them nothing at all as it was ; but I did not like to ask. Neither
did I like to say, that I hoped he had not been too communicative to Uriah ;
or to inquire if they had talked much about me, I was afraid of hurting
Mr. Micawber's feelings, or, at all events, Mrs. Micawber's, she being
very sensitive ; but I was uncomfortable about it, too, and often thought
about it afterwards.
   We had a beautiful little dinner. Quite an elegant dish of fish ; the
kidney-end of a loin of veal, roasted ; fried sausage-meat ; a partridge, and
a pudding. There was wine, and there was strong ale ; and after dinner
Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands.
   Mr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial. I never saw him such good
company. He made his face shine with the punch, so that it looked as if
it had been varnished all over. He got cheerfully sentimental about the
town, and proposed success to i t ; observing, that Mrs. Micawber and
himself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there, and that he
never should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in Canterbury.
He proposed me afterwards; and he, and Mrs. Micawber, and I, took a
review of our past acquaintance, in the course of which we sold the
property all over again. Then I proposed Mrs. Micawber ; or, at least,
said, modestly, "If you '11 allow me, Mrs. Micawber, I shall now have the
pleasure of drinking your health, ma'am." On which Mr. Micawber delivered
an eulogium on Mrs. Micawber's character, and said she had ever been his
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            18'7
guide, philosopher, and friend, and that he would recommend me, when I
came to a marrying time of life, to marry such another woman, if such
another woman could be found.
   As the punch disappeared, Mr. Micawber became still more friendly and
convivial. Mrs. Micawber's spirits becoming elevated, too, we sang "Auld
Lang Syne." When we came to "Here's a hand, my trusty frere," we all
joined hands round the table ; and when we declared we would " take a
right gude Willie Waught," and hadn't the least idea what it meant, we
were really affected.
   I n a word, I never saw any body so thoroughly jovial as Mr. Micawber
was, down to the very last moment of the evening, when I took a hearty
farewell of himself and his amiable wife. Consequently, I was not prepared,
at seven o'clock next morning, to receive the following communication,
dated half-past nine in the evening; a quarter of an hour after I had left him.
  "MY    DEAR   YOUNGFRIEND,
            "The die is cast-all is over. Hiding the ravages of care with
a sickly mask of mirth, I have not informed you, this evening, that there is
no hope of the remittance ! Under these circumstances, alike humiliating
to endure, humiliating to contemplate, and humiliating to relate, I have
discharged the pecuniary liability contracted at this establishment, by
giving a note of hand, made payable fourteen days after date, at my
residence, Pentonville, London. When it becomes due, it will not be taken
up. The result is destruction. The bolt is impending, and the tree must fall.
   " Let the wretched man who now addresses you, my dear Copperfield,
be a beacon to you through life. H e writes with that intention, and in
that hope. If he could think himself of so much use, one gleam of day
might, by possibility, penetrate into the cheerless dungeon of his
remaining existence-though his longevity is, at present (to say the least
of it), extremely problematical.
   "This is the last communication, my dear Copperfield, you will ever
receive                    l r From

                                    The
                                      " Beggared Outcast,

                                                 WILKINS MICAWBER.
   I was so shocked by the contents of this heart-rending letter, that I ran
off directly towards the little hotel with the intention of taking it on my
way to Doctor Strong's, and trying to soothe Mr. Micawber with a word
of comfort. But, half-way there, I met the London coach with Mr. and
Mrs. Micawber up behind; Mr. Micawber, the very picture of tranquil
enjoyment, smiling at Mrs. Micawber's conversation, eating walnuts out
of a paper bag, with a bottle sticking out of his breast pocket. As they
did not see me, I thought it best, all things considered, not to see them.
So, with a great weight taken off my mind, I turned into a by-street that
was the nearest way to school, and felt, upon the whole, relieved that they
were gone ; though I still liked them very much, nevertheless.
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                            CHAPTER XVIII.
                               A RETROSPECT.
    MY school-days ! The silent gliding on of my existence-the unseen,
 unfelt progress of my life-from childhood up to youth ! Let me think, as
 I look back upon that flowing water, now a dry channel overgrown with
leaves, whether there are any marks along its course, by which I can
remember how it ran.
   A moment, and I occupy my place in the Cathedral, where we all went
together, every Sunday morning, assembling first at school for that pur-
pose. The earthy smell, the sunless air, the sensation of the world being
shut out, the resounding of the organ through the black and white arched
galleries and aisles, are wings that take me back, and hold me hovering
above those days, in a half-sleeping and half-waking dream.
   I am not the last boy in the school. I have risen, in a few months, over
several heads. But the first boy seems to me a mighty creature, dwelling
afar off, whose giddy height is unattainable. Agnes says "No," but I say
"Yes," and tell her that she little thinks what stores of knowledge have been
mastered by the wonderful Being, at whose place she thinks I, even I, weak
aspirant, may arrive in time. H e is not my private friend and public
patron, as Steerforth was, but I hold him in a reverentialrespect. I chiefly
wonder what he 1' 1 be, when he leaves Doctor Strong's, and what mankind
will do to maintain any place against him.
   But who is this that breaks upon me? This is Miss Shepherd,whom I love.
   Miss Shepherd is a boarder at the Misses Nettingalls' establishment.
I adore Miss Shepherd. She is a little girl, in a spencer, with a round face
and curly flaxen hair. The Misses Nettingalls' young ladies come to the
Cathedral too. I cannot look upon my book, for I must look upon
Miss Shepherd. When the choristers chaunt, I hear Miss Shepherd. I n
the service I mentally insert Miss Shepherd's name-I put her in
among the Royal Family. At home, in my own room, I am sometimes
moved to cry out, " Oh, Miss Shepherd ! " in a transport of love.
   For some time, I am doubtful of Miss Shepherd's feelings, but, at
length, Fate being propitious, we meet at the dancing-school. I have
Miss Shepherd for my partner. I touch Miss Shepherd's glove, and feel
a thrill go up the right arm of my jacket, and come out at my hair. I say
nothing tender to Miss Shepherd, but we understand each other. Miss
Shepherd and myself live but to be united.
   Why do I secretly give Miss Shepherd twelve Brazil nuts for a present,
I wonder? They are not expressive of affection, they are difficult to pack
into a parcel of any regular shape, they are hard to crack, even in room
doors, and they are oily when cracked ; yet I feel that they are appropriate to
Miss Shepherd. Soft, seedy biscuits, also, I bestow upon Miss Shepherd;
and oranges innumerable. Once, I kiss Miss Shepherd in the cloak room.
Ecstacy ! What are my agony and indignation next day, when I hear
a flying rumour that the Misses Nettingall have stood Miss Shepherd in
the stocks for turning in her toes !
   Miss Shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my life, how
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          189
 do I ever come to break with her ? I can't conceive. And yet a coolness
 grows between Miss Shepherd and myself. Whispers reach me of Miss
 Shepherd having said she wished I wouldn't stare so, and having avowed
 a preference for Master Jones-for Jones ! a boy of no merit whatever!
 The gulf between me and Miss Shepherd widens. At last, one day, I
 meet the Misses Nettingalls' establishment out walking. Miss Shepherd
 makes a face as she goes by, and laughs to her companion. All is over.
 The devotion of a life-it seems a life, it is all the same-is          at an
 end; Miss Shepherd comes out of the morning service, and the Royal
 Family know her no more.
    I am higher in the school, and no one breaks my peace. I am not at
 all polite, now, to the Misses Nettingalls' young ladies, and shouldn't dote
 on any of them, if they were twice as many and twenty times as beautiful.
 I think the dancing-school a tiresome affair, and wonder why the girls
 can't dance by themselves and leave us alone. I am growing great in
 Latin verses, and neglect the laces of my boots. Doctor Strong refers to
 me in public as a promising young scholar. Mr. Dick is wild with joy,
 and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post.
    The shade of a young butcher rises, like the apparition of an armed
 head in Macbeth. Who is this young butcher? He is the terror of the
youth of Canterbury. There is a vague belief abroad, that the beef suet
with which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural strength, and that he
is a match for a man. He is a broad-faced, bull-necked young butcher,
with rough red cheeks, an ill-conditioned mind, and an injurious tongue.
His main use of this tongue, is, to disparage Doctor Strong's young gentle-
men. He says, publicly, that if they want anything he 1' 1 give it 'em.
He names individuals among them (myself included), whom he could
undertake to settle with one hand, and the other tied behind him. H e
waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads, and calls
challenges after me in the open streets. For these sufficient reasons I
resolve to fight the butcher.
    It is a summer evening, down in a green hollow, at the corner of a
wall. I meet the butcher by appointment. I am attended by a select
body of our boys ; the butcher, by two other butchers, a young publican,
and a sweep. The preliminaries are adjusted, and the butcher and myself
stand face to face. I n a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles
out of my left eyebrow. I n another moment, I don't know where the wall
is, or where I am, or where anybody is. I hardly know which is myself
and which the butcher, we are always in such a tangle and tustle, knock-
ing about upon the trodden grass. Sometimes I see the butcher, bloody
but confident; sometimes I see nothing, and sit gasping on my second's
knee; sometimes I go in at the butcher madly, and cut my knuckles open
against his face, without appearing to discompose him at all. At last I
awake, very queer about the head, as from a giddy sleep, and see the
butcher walking off, congratulated by the two other butchers and the
sweep and publican, and putting on his coat as he goes; from which I
augur, justly, that the victory is his.
   I am taken home in a sad plight, and I have beef-steaks put to my eyes,
and am rubbed with vinegar and brandy, and find a great white puffy place
bursting out on my upper lip, which swells immoderately. For three or
four days I remain at home, a very ill-looking subject, with a green shade
190           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

over my eyes ; and I should be very dull, but that Agnes is a sister to me,
and condoles with me, and reads to me, and makes the time light and
happy. Agnes has my confidence completely, always; I tell her all about
the butcher, and the wrongs he has heaped upon me; and she thinks I
couldn't have done otherwise than fight the butcher, while she shrinks and
trembles at my having fought him.
   Time has stolen on unobserved, for Adams is not the head-boy in the
days that are come now, nor has he been this many and many a day.
Adams has left the school so long, that when he comes back, on a visit to
Doctor Strong, there are not many there, besides myself, who know him.
Adams is going to be called to the bar almost directly, and is to be an
advocate, and to wear a wig. I am surprised to find him a meeker man
than I had thought, and less imposing in appearance. H e has not stag-
gered the world yet, either; for it goes on (as well as I can make out)
pretty much the same as if he had never joined it.
   A blank, through which the warriors of poetry and history march on
in stately hosts that seem to have no end-and what comes next! I
am the head boy, now ; and look down on the line of boys below me, with a
condescending interest in such of them as bring to my mind the boy I was
myself, when I first came there. That little fellow seems to be no part of
me ; I remember him as something left behind upon the road of life-as
something I have passed, rather than have actually been-and almost think
of him as of some one else.
   And the little girl I saw on that first day at Mr. Wickfield's, where is
she? Gone also. I n her stead, the perfect likeness of the picture, a
child likeness no more, moves about the house; and Agnes-my sweet
sister, as I call her in my thoughts, my counsellor and friend, the better
angel of the lives of all who come within her calm, good, self-denying
influence-is quite a woman.
   What other changes have come upon me, besides the changes in my
growth and looks, and in the knowledge I have garnered all this while ?
I wear a gold watch and chain, a ring upon my little finger, and a long-
tailed coat; and I use a great deal of bear's grease-which, taken in
conjunction with the ring, looks bad. Am I in love again? I am. I
worship the eldest Miss Larkins.
   The eldest Miss Larkins is not a little girl. She is a tall, dark, black-
eyed, fine figure of a woman. The eldest Miss Larkins is not a chicken ;
for the youngest Miss Larkins is not that, and the eldest must be three or
four years older. Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be about thirty.
My passion for her is beyond all bounds.
    The eldest Miss Larkins knows officers. I t is an awful thing to bear. I
 see them speaking to her in the street. I see them cross the way to meet
her, when her bonnet (she has a bright taste in bonnets) is seen coming
 down the pavement, accompanied by her sister's bonnet. She laughs and
talks, and seems to like it. I spend a good deal of my own spare time in
walking up and down to meet her. If I can bow to her once in the day (I
know her to bow to, knowing Mr. Larkins), I am happier. I deserve a bow
now and then. The raging agonies I suffer on the night of the Race Ball,
where I know the eldest Miss Larkinswill be dancing with the military, ought
 to have some compensation, if there be even-handed justice in the world.
    My passion takes away my appetite, and makes me wear my newest
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           191
silk neck-kerchief continually. I have no relief but in putting on my best
clothes, and having my boots cleaned over and over again. I seem, then,
to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins. Everything that belongs to her,
or is connected with her, is precious to me. Mr. Larkins (a gruff old
gentleman with a double chin, and one of his eyes immoveable in his head)
is fraught with interest to me. When I can't meet his daughter, I go
where I am likely to meet him. To say " How do you do, Mr. Larkins?
Are the young ladies and all the family quite well? " seems so pointed,
that I blush.
    I think continually about my age. Say I am seventeen, and say that
seventeen is young for the eldest Miss Larkins, what of that? Besides,
I shall be one and-twenty in no time almost. I regularly take walks
outside Mr. Larkins's house in the evening, though it cuts me to the
heart to see the officers go in, or to hear them up in the drawing-room, where
the eldest Miss Larkins plays the harp. I even walk, on two or three
occasions, in a sickly, spoony manner, round and round the house after the
family are gone to bed, wondering which is the eldest Miss Larkins's chamber
(and pitching, I dare say now, on Mr. Larkins's instead) ; wishing that a
fire would burst out ;that the assembled crowd would stand appalled ;that
I, dashing through them with a ladder, might rear it against her window,
 save her in my arms, go back for something she had left behind, and
perish in the flames. For I am generally disinterested in my love, and
think I could be content to make a figure before Miss Larkins, and expire.
    -Generally, but not always. Sometimes brighter visions rise before
me. When I dress (the occupation of two hours), for a great ball given at
the Larkins's (the anticipation of three weeks), I indulge my fancy with
pleasing images. I picture myself taking courage to make a declaration
to Miss Larkins. I picture Miss Larkins sinking her head upon my
shoulder, and saying, " Oh, Mr. Copperfield, can I believe my ears ! " I
picture Mr. Larkins waiting on me next morning, and saying, " My dear
Copperfield, my daughter has told me all. Youth is no objection. Here
are twenty thousand pounds. Be happy ! " I picture my aunt relenting,
and blessing us ; and Mr. Dick and Doctor Strong being present at the
marriage ceremony. I am a sensible fellow, I believe-I believe, on looking
back, I mean-and modest I am sure ; but all this goes on notwithstanding.
   I repair to the enchanted house, where there are lights, chattering,
music, flowers, officers ( I am sorry to see), and the eldest Miss Larkins,
a blaze of beauty. She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers in her hair-
forget-me-nots-as if she had any need to wear forget-me-nots ! I t is the
first really grown-up party that I have ever been invited to, and I am a
little uncomfortable ; for I appear not to belong to anybody, and nobody
appears to have anything to say to me, except Mr. Larkins, who asks me
how my schoolfellows are, which he needn't do, as I have not come there
to be insulted. But after I have stood in the doorway for some time, and
feasted my eyes upon the goddess of my heart, she approaches me-she,
the eldest Miss Larkins!-and asks me, pleasantly, if I dance.
   I stammer, with a bow, "With YOU, Miss Larkins."
    "With no one else ? " enquires Miss Larkins.
    "I should have no pleasure in dancing with any one else."
   Miss Larkins laughs and blushes (or I think she blushes), and says,
"Next time but one, I shall be very glad."
192            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   The time arrives. "It is a waltz,I think," MissLarkins doubtfully observes,
when I present myself. "Do you waltz ? If not, Captain Bailey "        -
   But I do waltz (pretty well, too, as it happens), and I take Miss
Larkins out. I take her sternly from the side of Captain Bailey. He is
wretched, I have no doubt; but he is nothing to me. I have been
wretched, too. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins ! I don't know where,
among whom, or how long. I only know that I swim about in space, with a
blue angel, in a state of blissful delirium, until I find myself alone with her
in a little room, resting on a sofa. She admires a flower (pink camelia
japonica, price half-a-crown), in my button hole. I give it her, and say :
   "I ask an inestimable price for it, Miss Larkins."
   " Indeed ! What is that ? " returns Miss Larkins.
   " A flower of yours, that I may treasure it as a miser does gold."
   " You 're a bold boy," says Miss Larkins. " There."
   She gives it me, not displeased; and I put it to my lips, and then into
my breast. Miss Larkins, laughing, draws her hand through my arm,
and says, "Now take me back to Captain Bailey."
   I am lost in the recollection of this delicious interview, and the waltz,
when she comes to me again, with a plain elderly gentleman, who has been
playing whist all night, upon her arm, and says :
   " Oh ! here is my bold friend ! Mr. Chestle wants to know you, Mr.
Copperfield."
   I feel at once that he is a friend of the family, and am much gratified.
   "I admire your taste, sir," says Mr. Chestle. " I t does you credit. I
suppose you don't take much interest in hops ; but I am a pretty large
grower myself; and if you ever like to come over to our neighbourhood-
neighbourhood of Ashford-and take a run about our place, we shall be
glad for you to stop as long as you like."
   I thank Mr. Chestle warmly, and shake hands. I think I am in a
happy dream. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins once again-she
says I waltz so well ! I go home in a state of unspeakable bliss, and
waltz in imagination, all night long, with my arm round the blue waist of
my dear divinity. For some days afterwards, I am lost in rapturous
reflections ; but I neither see her in the street, nor when I call. I am im-
perfectly consoled for this disappointment by the sacred pledge, the
perished flower.
   "Trotwood," says Agnes, one day after dinner. " Who do you think
is going to be married to-morrow? Some one you admire."
   " Not you, I suppose, Agnes ? "
   " Not me ! " raising her cheerful face from the music she is copying.

" Do you hear him, Papa?-The eldest Miss Larkins."
   " To-to     Captain Bailey ? " I have just power enough to ask.
   " No ; to no Captain.     To Mr. Chestle, a hop-grower."
   I am terribly dejected for about a week or two. I take off my ring, I wear
my worst clothes, I use no bear's grease, and I frequently lament over the
late Miss Larkins's faded flower. Being, by that time, rather tired of this
kind of life, and having received new provocation from the butcher, I throw
the flower away, go out with the butcher, and gloriously defeat him.
   This, and the resumption of my ring, as well as of the bear's grease in
moderation, are the last marks I can discern, now, in my progress to
seventeen.

         IMPROVED TRANSPARENT TRACING PAPER,
      Warranted of the very best material.               Samples will be sent free, upon a ~ l i c a t i o n .
     The following extracts from the "Art Union," and "Magazine of Science," will be sufficient
guarantee of the excellent quality of these papers, and the great celebrity to which they have attained :
    Art Union.-"Messrs. Waterlow and Sons' Tracing Paper is certainly the best we have ever tried, being per-
fectly transparent, though sufficientlythick for all practical purposes, and perfectly free from that oiliness we
generally meet with in paper of a similar description, taking the ink as readily as ordinary writing paper. I t
must be invaluable to all who require the use of such an article!'
    Magazine of Science.-" To those very numerous classes of the public-artists, architects,engineers, map-makers
pattern-drawers-indeed to all who, whether professionallyor otherwise, have occasion to employ tracingpape~
we would, with earnestness, urge the extreme worth and merits of that manufactured by Messrs. Waterlow and
Sons. In happy contrast to the paper of a like nature, too frequently to be met with, theirs is entirely devoid of
all nasty, unclean greasiness; it is thoroughly transparent, and can be traced over either by the pencil, or-a great
desideratum-by pen and ink. Assuredly this is a very admirable article."

   The increasing demand for these Presses, and the great satisfaction which they have universally
given, have induced us to manufacture a large stork of the most useful sizes; we are therefore
enabled to offer them at much lower prices than heretofore ; the large sale which they have met with
has convinced us of the impolicy of endeavouring to maintain the old and extravagant scale of prices
charged at a time when it was the exception, instead of as at present the rule, for every Counting-
house or Gentleman's Library to be furnished witli a Copying Machine. These Machines, although
lower i n price than those o f a n y other manufacturer, are all warranted, and will be immediately
exchanged, or the money returned, if any fault is discovered.

T   H E peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
              FRENCH W O O L MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest material, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,
             GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
  These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
                  THE EIDER DOWN QUILT
also, is to be seen only a t their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
Carriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                            BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, W I T H PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable.

             Of the Inner Temple, Barrister, Author of     " Lives      of Statesmen of the Commonwealth."
  " A fitting, and we think, a permanent companion to the works of the author whose career it commemorates :-
a gentle but a manly apology for the life, which it tracks through each pathetic transition of light and shadow:
written in that spirit of which Goldsmith himself would have approved-pleasing while it instructs us, mild
without tameness, earnest without acerbity."-Edinburgh Review.

                            CHAPTER XIX.
             I LOOK ABOUT ME, A N D MAKE A DISCOVERY.

    I A M doubtful whether I was at heart glad or sorry, when my school-
 days drew to an end, and the time came for my leaving Doctor Strong's.
 I had been very happy there, I had a great attachment for the Doctor, and
 I was eminent and distinguished in that little world. For these reasons
 I was sorry to go ; but for other reasons, unsubstantial enough, I was
 glad. Misty ideas of being a young man at my own disposal, of the
importance attaching to a young man at his own disposal, of the wonder-
ful things to be seen and done by that magnificent animal, and the
wonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society, lured me away.
 So powerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind, that I
seem, according to my present way of thinking, to have left school without
natural regret. The separation has not made the impression on me, that
other separations have. I try in vain to recal how I felt about it, and what
its circumstances were ; but it is not momentous in my recollection. I sup-
pose the opening prospect confused me. I know that my juvenile experiences
went for little or nothing then; and that life was more like a great fairy
story, which I was just about to begin to read, than anything else.
    My aunt and I had held many grave deliberations on the calling to
which I should be devoted. For a year or more I had endeavoured to find
a satisfactory answer to her often-repeated question, "What I would like
to be ?" But I had no particular liking, that I could discover, for anything.
I f I could have been inspired with a knowledge of the science of navigation,
taken the command of a fast-sailing expedition, and gone round the world
on a triumphant voyage of discovery, I think I might have considered myself
completely suited. But, in the absence of any such miraculous provision,
my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit that would not lie too
heavily upon her purse ; and to do my duty in it, whatever it might be.
    Mr. Dick had regularly assisted at our councils, with a meditative and
sage demeanour. He never made a suggestion but once; and on that
occasion (I don't know what put it in his head), he suddenly proposed
that I should be " a Brazier." My aunt received this proposal so very
ungraciously, that he never ventured on a second; but ever afterwards
confined himself to looking watchfully at her for her suggestions, and
rattling his money.
    "Trot, I tell you what, my dear," said my aunt, one morning in the
Christmas season when I left school; "as this knotty point is still unset-
tled, and as we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can help it,
I think we had better take a little breathing-time. I n the meanwhile, you
must try to look at it from a new point of view, and not as a schoolboy."
    " I will, aunt."
    " I t has occurred to me," pursued my aunt, " that a little change, and a
glimpse of life out of doors, may be useful, in helping you to know your
                                                                0
194            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

own mind, and form a cooler judgment. Suppose you were to take a little
journey now. Suppose you were to go down into the old part of the
country again, for instance, and see that-that          out-of-the-way woman
with the savagest of names," said my aunt, rubbing her nose, for she
could never thoroughly forgive Peggotty for being so called.
    " Of all things in the world, aunt, I should like it best ! "

    " Well," said my aunt, "that's       lucky, for I should like it too. But
it 's natural and rational that you should like it. And I am very well per-
suaded that whatever you do, Trot, will always be natural and rational."
    " I hope so, aunt."

    " Your sister, Betsey Trotwood," said my aunt, "would have been as

natural and rational a girl as ever breathed. You'll be worthy of her,
won't you ? "
    "I hope I shall be worthy of you, aunt. That will be enough for me."
    "It's a mercy that poor dear baby of a mother of yours didn't live,"
 said my aunt, looking at me approvingly, '(or she'd have been so vain of
her boy by this time, that her soft little head would have been completely
turned, if there was anything of it left to turn." (My aunt always excused
 any weakness of her own in my behalf, by transferring it in this way to
 my poor mother.) "Bless me, Trotwood, how you do remind me of her ! "
    " Pleasantly, I hope, aunt ? " said I.
    "He's as like her, Dick," said my aunt, emphatically, "he 's as like
her, as she was that afternoon, before she began to fret-bless my heart,
he's as like her, as he can look at me out of his two eyes ! "
        I s he indeed ? " said Mr. Dick.
    " And he's like David, too," said my aunt, decisively.
    " H e is very like David ! " said Mr. Dick.

    " But what I want you to be, Trot,"         resumed my aunt "-I don't
 mean physically, but morally; you are very well physically-is, a firm
 fellow. A fine firm fellow, with a will of your own. With resolution," said
 my aunt, shaking her cap at me, and clenching her hand. "With deter-
mination. With character, Trot-with strength of character that is not
 to be influenced, except on good reason, by anybody, or by anything.
 That's what I want you to be. That's what your father and mother
might both have been, Heaven knows, and been the better for it."
    I intimated that I hoped I should be what she described.
    " That you may begin, in a small way, to have a reliance upon yourself,
 and to act for yourself," said my aunt, " I shall send you upon your trip,
 alone. I did think, once, of Mr. Dick's going with you; but, on second
 thoughts, I shall keep him to take care of me."
    Mr. Dick, for a moment, looked a little disappointed ; until the honor
 and dignity of having to take care of the most wonderful woman in the
 world, restored the sunshine to his face.
     " Besides," said my aunt, "there's the Memorial-"
     " Oh, certainly," said Mr. Dick, in a hurry, "I intend, Trotwood, to

 get that done immediately-it really must be done immediately ! And
 then it will go in, you know-and then-," said Mr. Dick, after checking
 himself, and pausing a long time, " there '11 be a pretty kettle of fish ! "
     I n pursuance of my aunt's kind scheme, I was shortly afterwards fitted out
 with a handsome purse of money, and a portmanteau, and tenderly dismissed

  upon my expedition. At parting, my aunt gave me some good advice, and a
  good many kisses ; and said that as her object was that I should look about
  me, and should think a little, she would recommend me to stay a few days
  in London, if I liked it, either on my way down into Suffolk, or in coming
  back. In a word, I was at liberty to do what I would, for three weeks or
  a month ; and no other conditions were imposed upon my freedom than
  the before-mentionedthinking and looking about me, and a pledge to write
  three times a week and faithfully report myself.
     I went to Canterbury first, that I might take leave of Agnes and Mr.
 Wickfield (my old room in whose house I had not yet relinquished), and
 also of the good Doctor. Agnes was very glad to see me, and told me
 that the house had not been like itself since I had left it.
    " I am sure I am not like myself when I am away," said I. " I 'seem
to want my right hand, when I miss you. Though that's not saying
much ; for there's no head in my right hand, and no heart. Every one
who knows you, consults with you, and is guided by you, Agnes."
    " Every one who knows me, spoils me, I believe," she answered, smiling.
    "No. I t ' s because you are like no one else. You are so good, and
so sweet-tempered. You have such a gentle nature, and you are always
right."
    "You talk," said Agnes, breaking into a pleasant laugh, as she sat at
work, "as if I were the late Miss Larkins."
    " Come ! I t 's not fair to abuse my confidence," I answered, redden-
ing at the recollection of my blue enslaver. " But I shall confide in you,
just the same, Agnes. I can never grow out of that. Whenever I fall
into trouble, or fall in love, I shall always tell you, if you'll let me-even
 when I come to fall in love in earnest."
    "Why, you have always been in earnest! " said Agnes, laughing
 again.
    " Oh ! that was as a child, or a school-boy," said I, laughing in my
turn, not without being a little shame-faced. "Times are altering now,
and I suppose I shall be in a terrible state of earnestness one day or other.
My wonder is, that you are not in earnest yourself, by this time, Agnes."
    Agnes laughed again, and shook her head.
    " Oh, I know you are not ! " said I, "because if you had been, you

would have told me. Or at least "-for I saw a faint blush in her face,
"you would have let me find it out for myself. But there is no one that
I know of, who deserves to love you, Agnes. Some one of a nobler character,
and more worthy altogether than any one I have ever seen here, must rise
up, before I give my consent. I n the time to come, I shall have a wary
eye on all admirers; and shall exact a great deal from the successful
one, I assure you."
    We had gone on, so far, in a mixture of coddentid jest and earnest,
that had long grown naturally out of our familiar relations, begun as mere
children. But Agnes, now suddenly lifting up her eyes to mine, and
speaking in a different manner, said :
    " Trotwood, there is something that I want to ask you, and that I may
not have another opportunity of asking for a long time, perhaps-something
I would ask, I think, of no one else. Have you observed any gradual
alteration in Papa? "
                                     0   2
196           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    I had observed it, and had often wondered whether she had too. I
must have shown as much, now, in my face ; for her eyes were in a moment
cast down, and I saw tears in them.
    "Tell me what it is," she said, in a low voice.
    " I think-shall I be quite plain, Agnes, liking him so much ? "
    " Yes," she said.
    "I think he does himself no good by the habit that has increased upon
him since I first came here. He is often very nervous-or I fancy so."
    " I t is not fancy," said Agnes, shaking her head.
    " His hand trembles, his speech is not plain, and his eyes look wild. I
have remarked that at those times, and when he is least like himself, he is
most certain to be wanted on some business."
    "By Uriah," said Agnes.
    "Yes ; and the sense of being unfit for it, or of not having understood
it, or of having shown his condition in spite of himself, seems to make
him so uneasy, that next day he is worse, and next day worse, and so he
becomes jaded and haggard. Do not be alarmed by what I say, Agnes,
but in this state I saw him, only the other evening, lay down his head
upon his desk, and shed tears like a child."
    Her hand passed softly before my lips while I was yet speaking, and in
a moment she had met her father at the door of the room, and was hang-
ing on his shoulder. The expression of her face, as they both looked
towards me, I felt to be very touching. There was such deep fondness for
him, and gratitude to him for all his love and care, in her beautiful look ;
and there was such a fervent appeal to me to deal tenderly by him, even in
my inmost thoughts, and to let no harsh construction find any place against
him; she was, at once, so proud of him and devoted to him, yet so compas-
sionate and sorry, and so reliant upon me to be so, too ; that nothing she
could have said would have expressed more to me, or moved me more.
    We were to drink tea at the Doctor's. We went there at the usual
hour; and round the study-fireside found the Doctor, and his young wife,
and her mother. The Doctor, who made as much of my going away as if
I were going to China, received me as an honored guest; and called for a
log of wood to be thrown on the fire, that he might see the face of his old
pupil reddening in the blaze.
    " I shall not see many more new faces in Trotwood's stead, Wickfield,"

said the Doctor, warming his hands; " I am getting lazy, and want
ease. I shall relinquish all my young people in another six months, and
lead a quieter life."
    "You have said so, any time these ten years, Doctor," Mr. Wickfield
answered.
    " But now I mean to do it," returned the Doctor.       "My first master
will succeed me-I am in earnest at last-so you '11 soon have to arrange
our contracts, and to bind us firmly to them, like a couple of knaves."
    "And to take care," said Mr. Wickfield, "that you 're not imposed
on, eh?-as you certainly would be, in any contract you should make for
yourself. Well! I am ready. There are worse tasks than that, in my
calling."
    " I shall have nothing to think of then," said the Doctor, with a smile,

 " but my Dictionary ; and this other contract-bargain-Annie."
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            197
   As Mr. Wickfield glanced towards her, sitting at the tea-table by
Agnes, she seemed to me to avoid his look with such unwonted hesitation
and timidity, that his attention became fixed upon her, as if something
were suggested to his thoughts.
   " There is a post come in from India, I observe," he said, after a short
silence.
   " By-the-by ! and letters from Mr. Jack Maldon ! " said the Doctor.
   " Indeed ? "
   " Poor dear Jack ! " said Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head.            "That
trying climate!-like      living, they tell me, on a sand-heap, underneath
a burning-glass ! H e looked strong, but he wasn't. My dear Doctor, it
was his spirit, not his constitution, that he ventured on so boldly. Annie,
my dear, I am sure you must perfectly recollect that your cousin never
was strong-not what can be called rodust, you know," said Mrs. Markle-
ham, with emphasis, and looking round upon us generally "-from the
time when my daughter and himself were children together, and walking
about, arm in arm, the livelong day."
   Annie, thus addressed, made no reply.
   "Do I gather from what you say, ma'am, that Mr. Maldon is ill? "
asked Mr. Wickfield.
   " I11 ! " replied the Old Soldier. " My dear sir, he is all sorts of things."
   " Except well? " said Mr. Wickfield.
   " Except well, indeed ! " said the Old Soldier. " He has had dreadful
strokes of the sun, no doubt, and jungle fevers and agues, and every kind
of thing you can mention. As to his liver," said the Old Soldier resign-
edly, " that, of course, he gave up altogether, when he first went out ! "
   " Does he say all this ? " asked Mr. Wickfield.
   " Say? My dear sir," returned Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head and

her fan, <'you little know my poor Jack Maldon when you ask that
question. Say? Not he. You might drag him at the heels of four
wild horses first."
   " Mama ! " said Mrs. Strong.

   " Annie, my dear," returned her mother, "once for all, I must really
beg that you will not interfere with me, unless it is to confirm what I say.
You know as well as I do, that your cousin Maldon would be dragged at
the heels of any number of wild horses-why should I confine myself to
four! I won't confine myself to four-eight, sixteen, two-and-thirty,
rather than say anything calculated to overturn the Doctor's plans."
   "Wickfield's plans," said the Doctor, stroking his face, and looking
penitently at his adviser. " That is to say, our joint plans for him.
I said myself, abroad or at home."
   "And I said," added Mr. Wickfield gravely, " abroad. I was the
means of sending him abroad. I t ' s my responsibility."
   " Oh ! Responsibility ! " said the Old Soldier. "Every thing was done

for the best, my dear Mr. Wickfield ; every thing was done for the kindest
and best, we know. But if the dear fellow can't live there, he can't live
there. And if he can't live there, he '11 die there, sooner than he' 11 over-
turn the Doctor's plans. I know him," said the Old Soldier, fanning
herself, in a sort of calm prophetic agony, " and I know he'll die there,
sooner than he 1' 1 overturn the Doctor's plans."
198           THE PERSOKAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   '( Well, well, ma'am," said the Doctor, cheerfully, "I am not bigoted
to my plans, and I can overturn them myself. I can substitute some
other plans. If Mr. Jack Maldon comes home on account of ill health, he
must not be allowed to go back, and we must endeavour to make some
more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country."
   Mrs. Markleham was so overcome by this generous speech-which, I
need not say, she had not at all expected or led up to-that she could only
tell the Doctor it was like himself, and go several times through that
operation of kissing the sticks of her fan, and then tapping his hand with
it. After which she gently chid her daughter Annie, for not being more
demonstrative when such kindnesses were showered, for her sake, on her
old playfellow ; and entertained us with some particulars concerning other
deserving members of her family, whom it mas desirable to set on their
deserving legs.
   All this time, her daughter Annie never once spoke, or lifted up her
eyes. All this time, Mr. Wickfield had his glance upon her as she sat by
his own daughter's side. I t appeared to me that he never thought of
being observed by any one ; but was so intent upon her, and upon his own
thoughts in connexion with her, as to be quite absorbed. He now asked
what Mr. Jack Maldon had actually written in reference to himself, and to
whom he had written it ?
    "Why, here," said Mrs. Markleham, taking a letter from the chimney-
piece above the Doctor's head, " the dear fellow says to the Doctor him-
self-where is it ? Oh !-' I am sorry to inform you that my health is
suffering severely, and that I fear I may be reduced to the necessity of
returning home for a time, as the only hope of restoration.' That's
pretty plain, poor fellow ! His only hope of restoration ! But Annie's
letter is plainer still. Annie, show me that letter again."
   " Not now, mama," she pleaded in a low tone.
    " My dear, you absolutely are, on some subjects, one of the most
ridiculous persons in the world," returned her mother, " and perhaps
the most unnatural to the claims of your own family. We never should
have heard of the letter at all, I believe, unless I had asked for it myself.
Do you call that confidence, my love, towards Doctor Strong? I am
surprised. You ought to know better."
   The letter was reluctantly produced; and as I handed it to the old lady,
I saw how the unwilling hand from which I took it, trembled.
   " Now let us see,"    said Mrs. Markleham, putting her glass to her eye,
"where the passage is. ' The remembrance of old times, my dearest Annie'
-and so forth-it's not there. 'The amiable old Proctor '-who 's he ?
Dear me, Annie, how illegibly your cousin Maldon writes, and how stupid
I am ! ' Doctor,' of course. Ah ! amiable indeed ! " Here she left off,
to kiss her fan again, and shake it at the Doctor, who was looking at us in
a state of placid satisfaction. "Now I have found it. ' YOUmay not be
surprised to hear, Annie ' "-no,    to be sure, knowing that he never was
really strong; what did I say just now ?-'that I have undergone so
much in this distant place, as to have decided to leave it at all hazards ;
on sick leave, if I can; on total resignation, if that is not to be obtained.
What I have endured, and do endure here, is insupportable.' And but
for the promptitude of that best of creatures," said Mrs. Markleham,
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           199
 telegraphing the Doctor as before, and refolding the letter, "it would be
insupportable to me to think of."
    Mr. Wickfield said not one word, though the old lady looked to him as
if for his commentary on this intelligence ; but sat severely silent, with his
 eyes fixed on the ground. Long after the subject was dismissed, and
 other topics occupied us, he remained so ; seldom raising his eyes, unless
to rest them for a moment, with a thoughtful frown, upon the Doctor, or
his wife, or both.
    The Doctor was very fond of music. Agnes sang with great sweetness
 and expression, and so did Mrs. Strong. They sang together, and played
 duets together, and we had quite a little concert. But I remarked two
 things : first, that though Annie soon recovered her composure, and was
 quite herself, there was a blank between her and Mr. Wickfield which sepa-
rated them wholly from each other ; secondly, that Mr. Wickfield seemed
 to dislike the intimacy between her and Agnes, and to watch it with
 uneasiness. And now, I must confess, the recollection of what I had seen
 on that night when Mr. Maldon went away, first began to return upon
 me with a meaning it had never had, and to trouble me. The innocent
 beauty of her face was not as innocent to me as it had been ; I mistrusted
 the natural grace and charm of her manner; and when I looked at Agnes
 by her side, and thought how good and true Agnes was, suspicions arose
 within me that it was an ill-assorted friendship.
     She was so happy in it herself, however, and the other was so happy
 too, that they made the evening fly away as if it were but an hour. It
 closed in an incident which I well remember. They were taking leave of
 each other, and Agnes was going to embrace her and kiss her, when Mr.
 Wickfield stepped between them, as if by accident, and drew Agnes quickly
 away. Then I saw, as though all the intervening time had been can-
  celled, and I were still standing in the doorway on the night of the
 departure, the expression of that night in the face of Mrs. Strong, as it
co&onted his.
    I cannot say what an impression this made upon me, or how impossible
I found it, when I thought of her afterwards, to separate her from this
look, and remember her face in its innocent loveliness again. I t haunted
me when I got home. I seemed to have left the Doctor's roof with a dark
cloud lowering on it. The reverence that I had for his grey head, was
mingled with commiseration for his faith in those who were treacherous
to him, and with resentment against those who injured him. The
 impending shadow of a great affliction, and a great disgrace that had no
distinct form in it yet, fell like a stain upon the quiet place where I had
worked and played as a boy, and did it a cruel wrong. I had no pleasure
in thinking, any more, of the grave old broad-leaved aloe-trees which
remained shut up in themselves a hundred years together, and of the trim
smooth grass-plot, and the stone urns, and the Doctor's walk, and the
congenial sound of the Cathedral bell hovering above them all. I t was as
if the tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before my face,
and its peace and honor given to the winds.
    But morning brought with it my parting from the old house, which
Agnes had filled with her influence ; and that occupied my mind suffi-
ciently. I should be there again soon, no doubt ; I might sleep again-
200           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

perhaps often-in my old room; but the days of my inhabiting there
were gone, and the old time was past. I was heavier at heart when I
packed up such of my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent
to Dover, than I cared to show to Uriah Heep : who was so officious to help
me, that I uncharitably thought him mighty glad that I was going.
   I got away from Agnes and her father, somehow, with an indifferent
show of being very manly, and took my seat upon the box of the London
coach. I was so softened and forgiving, going through the town, that
I had half a mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher, and throw him
five shillings to drink. But he looked such a very obdurate butcher as he
stood scraping the great block in the shop, and moreover, his appearance
was so little improved by the loss of a front tooth which I had knocked
out, that I thought it best to make no advances.
   The main object on my mind, I remember, when we got fairly on the
road, was to appear as old as possible to the coachman, and to speak
extremely gruff. The latter point I achieved at great personal inconve-
nience ; but I stuck to it, because I felt it was a grown-up sort of thing.
   "You are going through, sir ?" said the coachman.
   " Yes, William," I said, condescendingly (I knew him) ; " I am going
to London. I shall go down into Suffolk afterwards."
   " Shooting, sir ? " said the coachman.
   H e knew as well as I did that it was just as likely, at that time of year,
I was going down there whaling ; but I felt complimented, too.
   " I don't know," I said, pretending to be undecided, "whether I shall
take a shot or not."
   "Birds is got wery shy, I 'm told," said William.
   " So I understand,"    said I.
   " I s Suffolk your county, sir?" asked William.
   " Yes,"   I said, with some importance, " Suffolk 's my county."
   " I ' m told the dumplings is uncommon fine down there," said
William.
   I was not aware of it myself, but I felt it necessary to uphold the
institutions of my county, and to evince a familiarity with them ; so I
shook my head, as much as to say '< I believe you ! "
   " And the Punches,"        said William. " There's cattle ! A Suffolk
Punch, when he's a good un, is worth his weight in gold. Did you ever
breed any Suffolk Punches yourself, sir ?"
   " N-no,"     I said, " not exactly."
   " Here's a gen'lm'n behind me, I 'I1 pound it," said William, " as has

bred 'em by wholesale."
   The gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising
squint, and a prominent chin, who had a tall white hat on with a narrow
flat brim, and whose close-fitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way
up outside his legs from his boots to his hips. His chin was cocked over
the coachman's shoulder, so near to me, that his breath quite tickled the
back of my head ; and as I looked round at him, he leered at the leaders
with the eye with which he didn't squint, in a very knowing manner.
   " Ain't you ? " said William.

   " Ain't I what ? " asked the gentleman behind.

   " Bred them Suffolk Punches by wholesale ? "
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            201
   " I should think so," said the gentleman. "There ain't no sort of orse
that I ain't bred, and no sort of dorg. Orses and dorgs is some men's
fancy. They 're wittles and drink to me-lodging, wife, and children-
reading, writing, and 'rithmetic-snuff, tobacker, and sleep."
   "That ain't a sort of man to see sitting behind a coach-box, is it
though? " said William in my ear, as he handled the reins.
   I construed this remark into an indication of a wish that he should
have my place, so I blushingly offered to resign it.
   "Well, if you don't mind, sir," said William, " I think it would be
more correct."
   I have always considered this as the first fall I had in life. When I
booked my place at the coach-office, I had had "Box Seat" written
against the entry, and had given the book-keeper half-a-crown. I was
got up in a special great coat and shawl, expressly to do honor to that
distinguished eminence ; had glorified myself upon it a good deal ; and had
felt that I was a credit to the coach. And here, in the very first stage, I
was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint, who had no other merit
than smelling like a livery-stables, and being able to walk across me, more
like a fly than a human being, while the horses were at a canter !
   A distrust of myself, which has often beset me in life on small occasions,
when it would have been better away, was assuredly not stopped in its
growth by this little incident outside the Canterbury coach. I t was in
vain to take refuge in gruffness of speech. I spoke from the pit of my
stomach for the rest of the journey, but I felt completely extinguished,
and dreadfully young.
   It was curious and interesting, nevertheless, to be sitting up there, behind
 four horses : well educated, well dressed, and with plenty of money in my
 pocket: and to look out for the places where I had slept on my weary
journey. I had abundant occupation for my thoughts, in every conspicuous
landmark on the road. When I looked down at the trampers whom we
passed, and saw that well-remembered style of face turned up, I felt as if
the tinker's blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again. When
we clattered through the narrow street of Chatham, and I caught a
glimpse, in passing, of the lane where the old monster lived who had
bought my jacket, I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where
I had sat, in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my money. When we
came, at last, within a stage of London, and passed the veritable Salem
House where Mr. Creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand, I would
have given all I had, for lawful permission to get down and thrash him,
and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows.
   We went to the Golden Cross at Charing Cross, then a mouldy sort of
establishment in a close neighbourhood. A waiter showed me into the
coffee-room ; and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber,
which smelt like a hackney-coach, and was shut up like a family vault. I
was still painfully conscious of my youth, for nobody stood in any awe of
me at all: the chambermaid being utterly indifferent to my opinions on
any subject, and the waiter being familiar with me, and offering advice to
my inexperience.
   " Well now," said the waiter, in a tone of confidence, " what would you

like for dinner ? Young gentlemen likes poultry in general, have a fowl !"
202           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    I told him, as majestically as I could, that I wasn't in the humour for
a fowl.
    "Ain't you ! " said the waiter. "Young gentlemen is generally tired of
beef and mutton, have a weal cutlet! "
    I assented to this proposal, in default of being able to suggest anything
else.
    "Do you care for taters? " said the waiter, with an insinuating smile,
and his head on one side. " Young gentlemen generally has been over-
dosed with taters."
    I commanded him, in my deepest voice, to order a veal cutlet and pota-
toes, and all things fitting; and to inquire at the bar if there were any
letters for Trotwood Copperfield, Esquire-which I knew there were not,
and couldn't be, but thought it manly to appear to expect.
    He soon came back to say that there were none (at which I was much
surprised), and began to lay the cloth for my dinner in a box by the fire.
While he was so engaged, he asked me what I would take with it ; and on
my replying '(Half a pint of sherry," thought it a favourable opportunity,
I am afraid, to extract that measure of wine from the stale leavings at the
bottoms of several small decanters. I am of this opinion, because, while I
was reading the newspaper, I observed him behind a low wooden par-
tition, which was his private apartment, very busy pouring out of a
number of those vessels into one, like a chemist and druggist making up
a prescription. When the wine came, too, I thought it flat ; and it cer-
tainly had more English crumbs in it, than were to be expected in a
foreign wine in anything like a pure state ; but I was bashful enough t o
drink it, and say nothing.
    Being, then, in a pleasant frame of mind (from which I infer that
 poisoning is not always disagreeable in some stages of the process), I
resolved to go to the play. I t was Covent Garden Theatre that I chose;
and there, from the back of a centre box, I saw Julius Czsar and the new
Pantomime. To have all those noble Romans alive before me, and
walking in and out for my entertainment, instead of being the stern task-
masters they had been at school, was a most novel and delightful effect.
But the mingled reality and mystery of the whole show, the influence
upon me of the poetry, the lights, the music, the company, the smooth
stupendous changes of glittering and brilliant scenery, were so dazzling,
and opened up such illimitable regions of delight, that when I came out
into the rainy street, at twelve o'clock at night, I felt as if I had come
from the clouds, where I had been leading a romantic life for ages, to
a bawling, splashing, link-lighted, umbrella-struggling, hackney-coach-
jostling, patten-clinking, muddy, miserable world.
    I had emerged by another door, and stood in the street for a little
 while, as if I really were a stranger upon earth: but the unceremonious
 pushing and hustling that I received, soon recalled me to myself, and put
 me in the road back to the hotel; whither I went, revolving the glorious
vision all the way; and where, after some porter and oysters, I sat
 revolving it still, at past one o'clock, with my eyes on the coffee-room fire.
    I was so filled with the play, and with the past-for it was, in a manner,
 like a shining transparency,through which I saw my earlier life moving along
 -that I don't know when the figure of a handsome well-formed young
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           203
man, dressed with a tasteful easy negligence which I have reason to remem-
ber very well, became a real presence to me. But I recollect being
conscious of his company without having noticed his coming in-and my
still sitting, musing, over the coffee-room fire.
   At last I rose to go to bed, much to the relief of the sleepy waiter, who
had got the fidgets in his legs, and was twisting them, and hitting
them, and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small
pantry. I n going towards the door, I passed the person who had come
in, and saw him plainly. I turned directly, came back, and looked again.
He did not know me, but I knew him in a moment.
   At another time I might have wanted the confidence or the decision to
speak to him, and might have put it off until next day, and might have
lost him. But, in the then condition of my mind, where the play was still
running high, his former protection of me appeared so deserving of my
gratitude, and my old love for him overflowed my breast so freshly and
spontaneously, that I went up to him at once, with a fast-beating heart,
and said :
    " Steerforth ! won't you speak to me ? "

    He looked at me-just as he used to look, sometimes-but I saw no
recognition in his face.
    " You don't remember me, I am afraid," said I.
    " My God ! " he suddenly exclaimed. " I t 's little Copperfield ! "
    I grasped him by both hands, and could not let them go. But for very
 shame, and the fear that it might displease him, I could have held him
round the neck and cried.
    " I never, never, never was so glad ! My dear Steerforth, I am so
 overjoyed to see you!"
     " And I am rejoiced to see you, too ! " he said, shaking my hands
 heartily. " Why, Copperfield, old boy, don't be overpowered ! " And yet
 he was glad, too, I thought, to see how the delight I had in meeting him
 affected me.
    I brushed away the tears that my utmost resolution had not been able
to keep back, and I made a clumsy laugh of it, and we sat down together,
side by side.
    "Why, how do you come to be here ? " said Steerforth, clapping me on
the shoulder.
    "I came here by the Canterbury coach, to-day. I have been adopted
by an aunt down in that part of the country, and have just finished my
education there. How do yozc come to be here, Steerforth ? "
    " Well, I am what they call an Oxford man," he returned ; "that is to
say, I get bored to death down there, periodically-and I am on my way
now to my mother's. You 're a devilish amiable-looking fellow, Copper-
field. Just what you used to be, now I look at you! Not altered in the
least ! "
    "I knew you immediately," I said; "but you are more easily
remembered."
   He laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair,
and said gaily :
    "Yes, I am on an expedition of duty. My mother lives a little way
out of town; and the roads being in a beastly condition, and our house
204           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

tedious enough, I remained here to-night instead of going on. I have
not been in town half-a-dozen hours, and those I have been dozing and
grumbling away at the play."
    "I have been at the play, too," said I. "At Covent Garden. What
a delightful and magnificent entertainment, Steerforth ! "
   Steerforth laughed heartily.
   -" My dear young Davy," he said, clapping me on the shoulder again,
"you are a very Daisy. The daisy of the field, at sunrise, is not fresher
than you are ! I have been at Covent Garden, too, and there never was
a more miserable business.-Holloa, you sir ! "
   This was addressed to the waiter, who had been very attentive to our
recognition, at a distance, and now came forward deferentially.
   "Where have you put my friend, Mr. Copperfield ? " said Steerforth.
   "Beg your pardon, sir? "
   "Where does he sleep ? What's his number ? You know what I mean,"
said Steerforth.
   " Well, sir," said the waiter, with an apologetic air. "Mr. Copperfield
is at present in forty-four, sir."
   "And what the devil do you mean," retorted Steerforth, "by putting
Mr. Copperfield into a little loft over a stable ? "
   "Why, you see we wasn't aware, sir," returned the waiter, still
apologetically, "as Mr. Copperfield was anyways particular. We can give
Mr. Copperfield seventy-two, sir, if it would be preferred. Next you, sir."
    " Of course it would be preferred," said Steerforth. "And do it at
once."
   The waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange. Steerforth,
very much amused at my having been put into forty-four, laughed again,
and clapped me on the shoulder again, and invited me to breakfast with
him next morning at ten o'clock-an        invitation I was only too proud and
happy to accept. I t being now pretty late, we took our candles and went
up-stairs, where we parted with friendly heartiness at his door, and where
I found my new room a great improvement on my old one, it not being at
all musty, and having an immense four-post bedstead in it, which was
quite a little landed estate. Here, among pillows enough for six, I soon
fell asleep in a blissful condition, and dreamed of ancient Rome, Steerforth,
and friendship, until the early morning coaches, rumbling out of the archway
underneath, made me dream of thunder and the gods.

                           CHAPTER XX.


   WHENthe chambermaid tapped at my door at eight o'clock, and informed
me that my shaving-water was outside, I felt severely the having no occa-
sion for it, and blushed in my bed. The suspicion that she laughed too,
when she said it, preyed upon my mind all the time I was dressing; and
gave me, I was conscious, a sneaking and guilty air when I passed her on
the staircase, as I was going down to breakfast. I was so sensitively
aware, indeed, of being younger than I could have wished, that for some
time I could not make up my mind to pass her at all, under the ignoble
circumstances of the case; but, hearing her there with a broom, stood
peeping out of window at King Charles on horseback, surrounded by
a maze of hackney-coaches and looking anything but regal in a drizzling
rain and a dark-brown fog, until I was admonished by the waiter that the
gentleman was waiting for me.
   I t was not in the coffee-room that I found Steerforth expecting me, but
in a snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where
the fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table
covered with a clean cloth ; and a cheerful miniature of the room, the fire,
the breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining in the little round mirror
over the sideboard. I was rather bashful at first, Steerforth being so self-
possessed, and elegant, and superior to me in all respects (age included) ;
but his easy patronage soon put that to rights, and made me quite a t
home. I could not enough admire the change he had wrought in the
Golden Cross ; or compare the dull forlorn state I had held yesterday, with
this morning's comfort and this morning's entertainment. As to the
waiter's familiarity, it was quenched as if it had never been. He attended
on us, as I may say, in sackcloth and ashes.
   " Now, Copperfield," said Steerforth, when we were alone, " I should
like to hear what you are doing, and where you are going, and all about
you. I feel as if you were my property."
   Glowing with pleasure to find that he had still this interest in me, I
told him how my aunt had proposed the little expedition that I had before
me, and whither it tended.
   c c As you are in no hurry, then," said Steerforth, " come home with me
to Highgate, and stay a day or two. You will be pleased with my
mother-she is a little vain and prosy about me, but that you can forgive
her-and she will be pleased with you."
   " I should like to be as sure of that, as you are kind enough to say you
are," I answered, smiling.
   " Oh ! " said Steerforth, "every one who likes me, has a claim on her
that is sure to be acknowledged."
   "Then I think I shall be a favorite," said I.
   " Good ! " said Steerforth. " Come and prove it. We will go and see
206           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

the lions for an hour or two-it 's something to have a fresh fellow like
you to show them to, Copperfield-and then we 1' 1 journey out to High-
gate by the coach."
   I could hardly believe but that I was in a dream, and that I should
wake presently in number forty-four, to the solitary box in the coffee-
room and the familiar waiter again. After I had written to my aunt
and told her of my fortunate meeting with my admired old school-
fellow, and my acceptance of his invitation, we went out in a hackney-
chariot, and saw a Panorama and some other sights, and took a walk
through the Museum, where I could not help observing how much Steer-
forth knew, on an infinite variety of subjects, and of how little account he
seemed to make his knowledge.
   "You'll take a high degree at college, Steerforth," said I, ('if you
have not done so already; and they will have good reason to be proud of
you."
   "I take a degree ! " cried Steerforth.    "Not I ! my dear Daisy-will
you mind my calling you Daisy? "
   " Not at all ! " said I.
   "That's a good fellow ! My dear Daisy," said Steerforth, laughing, "I
have not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself in that way. I
have done quite sufficient for my purpose. I find that I am heavy company
enough for myself, as I am."
    " But the fame-"        I was beginning.
    " You romantic Daisy !" said Steerforth, laughing still more heartily;
" why should I trouble myself, that a parcel of heavy-headed fellows may

gape and hold up their hands? Let them do it at some other man.
There's fame for him, and he's welcome to it."
    I was abashed at having made so great a mistake, and was glad to
 change the subject. Fortunately it was not difficult to do, for Steerforth
 could always pass from one subject to another with a carelessness and
lightness that were his own.
    Lunch succeeded to our sight-seeing, and the short winter day wore
away so fast, that it was dusk when the stage-coach stopped with us at an
old brick house at Highgate on the summit of the hill. An elderly lady,
though not very far advanced in years, with a proud carriage and a hand-
some face, was in the doorway as we alighted; and greeting Steerforth as
"My dearest James," folded him in her arms. To this lady he presented
me as his mother, and she gave me a stately welcome.
   I t was a genteel old-fashioned house, very quiet and orderly. From the
windows of my room I saw all London lying in the distance like a great
vapour, with here and there some lights twinkling through it. I had only
time, in dressing, to glance at the solid furniture, the framed pieces of
work (done, I supposed, by Steerforth's mother when she was a girl), and
some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hair and boddices,
coming and going on the walls, as the newly-kindled fire crackled and
sputtered, when I was called to dinner.
   There was a second lady in the dining-room, of a slight short figure,
dark, and not agreeable to look at, but with some appearance of good
looks too, who attracted my attention : perhaps because I had not expected
to see her ;perhaps because I found myself sitting opposite to her; perhaps
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           207
because of something really remarkable in her. She had black hair
and eager black eyes, and was thin, and had a scar upon her lip. I t was
an old scar-I should rather call it, seam, for it was not discolored, and
had healed years ago-which had once cut through her mouth, downward
towards the chin, but was now barely visible across the table, except above
and on her upper lip, the shape of which it had altered. I concluded in
my own mind that she was about thirty years of age, and that she wished
t o be married. She was a little dilapidated-like a house-with having
been so long t o let; yet had, as I have said, an appearance of good looks.
Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her, which
found a vent in her gaunt eyes.
    She was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his mother
called her Rosa. I found that she lived there, and had been for a long
time Mrs. Steerforth's companion. I t appeared to me that she never said
anything she wanted to say, outright ; but hinted it, and made a great deal
more of it by this practice. Por example, when Mrs. Steerforth observed,
more in jest than earnest, that she feared her son led but a wild life at
college, Miss Dartle put in thus :
    " Oh, really? You know how ignorant I am, and that I only ask for
information, but isn't it always so ? I thought that kind of life was on
all hands understood to be-eh ? "
    " I t is education for a very grave profession, if you mean that, Rosa,"
Mrs. Steerforth answered with some coldness.
    " Oh ! Yes ! That's very true," returned Miss Dartle.       "But isn't it,
though ?-I want to be put right if I am wrong-isn't it really ? "
    " Really what ? " said Mrs. Steerforth.

    " Oh ! You mean it's nod !" returned Miss Dartle.       " Well, I 'm very
 glad to hear it! Now, I know what to do. That's the advantage of
 asking. I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness
 and profligacy, and so forth, in connection with that life, any more."
    "And you will be right," said Mrs. Steerforth. "My son's tutor is a
 conscientious gentleman ; and if I had not implicit reliance on my son, I
 should have reliance on him."
    " Should you? " said Miss Dartle. "Dear me ! Conscientious, is he ?
 Really conscientious, now ? "
    " Yes, I am convinced of it," said Mrs. Steerforth.
    "How very nice ! " exclaimed Miss Dartle. "What a comfort ! Really
 conscientious ? Then he 's not-but of course he can't be, if he's really
 conscientious. Well, I shall be quite happy in my opinion of him, from
this time. You can't think how it elevates him in my opinion, to know
for certain that he 's really conscientious ! "
    Her own views of every question, and her correction of everything
that was said to which she was opposed, Miss Dartle insinuated in the
 same way: sometimes, I could not conceal from myself, with great power,
 though in contradiction even of Steerforth. An instance happened before
dinner was done. Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my intention of
going down into Suffolk, I said at hazard how glad I should be, if Steer-
forth would only go there with me ; and explaining to him that I was
going to see my old nurse, and Mr. Peggotty's family, I reminded him of
the boatman whom he had seen at school.
208           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Oh ! That bluff fellow ! " said Steerforth. " He had a son with him,
hadn't he ? "
    "No. That was his nephew," I replied ; "whom he adopted, though,
as a son. H e has a very pretty little niece too, whom he adopted as a
daughter. I n short, his house (or rather his boat, for he lives in one, on
dry land) is full of people who are objects of his generosity and kindness.
You would be delighted to see that household."
   " Should I ? " said Steerforth.      "Well, I think I should. I must see
what can be done. I t would be worth a journey-not to mention the
pleasure of a journey with you, Daisy,-to see that sort of people together,
and to make one of 'em."
   My heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure. But it was in reference
to the tone in which he had spoken of " that sort of people," that Miss
Dartle, whose sparkling eyes had been watchful of us, now broke in
again.
   " Oh, but, really? Do tell me. Are they, though? " she said.
   '< Are they what ? And are who what ? " said Steerforth.
   " That sort of people.-Are they really animals and clods, and beings
of another order? I want to know so much."
   "Why, there's a pretty wide separation between them and us," said
Steerforth, with indifference. "They are not to be expected to be as
sensitive as we are. Their delicacy is not to be shocked, or hurt very
easily. They are wonderfully virtuous, I dare say-some people contend
for that, at least ; and I am sure I don't want to contradict them-but
they have not very fine natures, and they may be thankful that, like their
coarse rough skins, they are not easily wounded."
    " Really ! " said Miss Dartle.   "Well, I don't know, now, when I have
been better pleased than to hear that. It's so consoling! It's such a
delight to know that, when they suffer, they don't feel ! Sometimes I have
been quite uneasy for that sort of people ;but now I shall just dismiss the
idea of them, altogether. Live and learn. I had my doubts, I confess,
but now they 're cleared up. I didn't know, and now I do know; and that
 shows the advantage of asking-don't i t ? "
    I believed that Steerforth had said what he had, in jest, or to draw Miss
Dartle out ; and I expected him to say as much when she was gone, and
we two were sitting before the fire. But he merely asked me what I thought
of her.
    " She is very clever, is she not ? " I asked.

    " Clever!   She brings everything to a grindstone," said Steerforth,
"and sharpens it, as she has sharpened her own face and figure these
years past. She has worn herself away by constant sharpening. She is
all edge."
    "What a remarkable scar that is upon her lip ! " I said.
    Steerforth's face fell, and he paused a moment.
    "Why, the fact is," he returned, "-I did that."
    " By an unfortunate accident !"
    "No. I was a young boy, and she exasperated me, and I threw a
hammer at her. A promising young angel I must have been ! "
    I was deeply sorry to have touched on such a painful theme, but that
 was useless now.
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

     <' She has borne the mark ever since, as you see," said Steerforth; "and
 she 1' 1 bear it to her grave, if she ever rests in one-though I can hardly
 believe she will ever rest anywhere. She was the motherless child of a
 sort of cousin of my father's. H e died one day. My mother, who was
 then a widow, brought her here to be company to her. She has a couple
 of thousand pounds of her own, and saves the interest of it every year, to
 add to the principal. There's the history of Miss Rosa Dartle for you."
     "And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother ? " said I.
     " Humph ! " retorted Steerforth, looking at the fire.     " Some brothers
 are not loved over much; and some love-but help yourself, Copperfield !
 We '11 drink the daisies of the field, in compliment to you ; and the lilies of
 the valley that toil not, neither do they spin, in compliment to me-the
 more shame for me !" A moody smile that had overspread his features
 cleared off as he said this merrily, and he was his own frank, winning self
 again.
     I could not help glancing at the scar with a painful interest when we
 went in to tea. I t was not long before I observed that it was the most
 susceptible part of her face, and that, when she turned pale, that mark
 altered first, and became a dull, lead-colored streak, lengthening out to its
 full extent, like a mark in invisible ink brought to the fire. There was a
 little altercation between her and Steerforth about a cast of the dice at
backgammon-when I thought her, for one moment, in a storm of rage;
 and then I saw it start forth like the old writing on the wall.
     I t was no matter of wonder to me to find Mrs. Steerforth devoted to her
 son. She seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else. She
 showed me his picture as an infant, in a locket, with some of his baby-hair
in it ; she showed me his picture as he had been when I first knew him ;
 and she wore at her breast his picture as he was now. All the letters he
 had ever written to her, she kept in a cabinet near her own chair by the
fire; and she would have read me some of them, and I should have been
very glad to hear them too, if he had not interposed, and coaxed her out
of the design.
    " I t was at Mr. Creakle's, my son tells me, that you first became ac-
quainted," said Mrs. Steerforth, as she and I were talking at one table,
while they played backgammon at another. "Indeed, I recollect his
speaking, at that time, of a pupil younger than himself who had taken his
fancy there; but your name, as you may suppose, has not lived in my
memory ."
    " H e was very generous and noble to me in those days, I assure you,
ma'am," said I, " and I stood in need of such a friend. I should have
been quite crushed without him."
    " H e is always generous and noble," said Mrs. Steerforth, proudly.

    I subscribed to this with all my heart, God knows. She knew I did;
for the stateliness of her manner already abated towards me, except when
she spoke in praise of him, and then her air was always lofty.
    " I t was not a fit school generally for my son," said she; "far from it ;

but there were particular circumstances to be considered at the time, of
more importance even than that selection. My son's high spirit made it
desirable that he should be placed with some man who felt its superiority,
and would be content to bow himself before i t ; and we found such a
man there."
                                                                  T.
910            T H E PERSONAL HISTORY A N D E X P E R I E N C E

    I knew that, knowing the fellow. And yet I did not despise him the
more for it, but thought it a redeeming quality in him-if he could be
allowed any grace for not resisting one so irresistible as Steerforth.
    " My son's great capacity was tempted on, there, by a feeling of volun-

tary emulation and conscious pride," the fond lady went on to say. " He
would have risen against all constraint ; but he found himself the monarch
of the place, and he haughtily determined to be worthy of his station. I t
was like himself."
    I echoed, with all my heart and soul, that it was like himself.
    " So my son took, of his own will, and on no compulsion, to the course

in which he can always, when it is his pleasure, outstrip every competitor,"
she pursued. " My son informs me, Mr. Copperfield, that you were quite
devoted to him, and that when you met yesterday you made yourself
known to him with tears of joy. I should be an affected woman if I made
any pretence of being surprised by my son's inspiring such emotions ; but
I cannot be indifferent to any one who is so sensible of his merit, and I
am very glad to see you here, and can assure you that he feels an unusual
friendship for you, and that you may rely on his protection."
     Miss Dartle plyed backgammon as eagerly as she did everything else. If
I had seen her, first, at the board, I should have fancied that her figure
had got thin, and her eyes had got large, over that pursuit, and no other
in the world. But I am very much mistaken if she missed a word of this,
 or lost a look of mine as I received it with the utmost pleasure, and,
 honored by Mrs. Steerforth's confidence, felt older than I had done since
 I left Canterbury.
     When the evening was pretty far spent, and a tray of glasses and decanters
 came in, Steerforth promised, over the fire, that he would seriously think
 of going down into the country with me. There was no hurry, he said;
 a week hence would do ; and his mother hospitably said the same. While
 we were talking, he more than once called me Daisy ;which brought Miss
 Dartle out again.
     " But really, Mr. Copperfield," she asked, "is it a nick-name ?          And
 why does he give it you? I s it-eh?-because               he thinks you young
 and innocent ? I am so stupid in these things."
     I colored in replying that I believed it was.
     "Oh! " said Miss Dartle. " Now I am glad to know that ! I ask
 for information, and I am glad to know it. H e thinks you young and
 innocent ; and so you are his friend. Well, that 's quite delightful ! "
     She went to bed soon after this, and Mrs. Steerforth retired too.
 Steerforth and I, after lingering for half an hour over the fire, talking about
 Traddles and all the rest of them at old Salem House, went up-stairs
 together. Steerforth's room was next to mine, and I went in to look at it.
 I t was a picture of comfort, full of easy chairs,cushions and footstools, worked
 by his mother's hand, and with no sort of thing omitted that could help
 to render it complete. Finally, her handsome features looked down on
 her darling from a portrait on the wall, as if it were even something to her
 that her likeness should watch him while he slept.
     I found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time, and
  the curtains drawn before the windows and round the bed, giving it a
  very snug appearance. I sat down in a great chair upon the hearth
  to meditate on my happiness; and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

some time, when I found a likeness of Miss Dartle looking eagerly at me
from above the chimney-piece.
   I t was a startling likeness, and necessarily had a startling look. The
painter hadn't made the scar, but I made i t ; and there it was, coming
and going : now confined to the upper lip as I had seen it at dinner, and
now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer, as I
had seen it when she was passionate.
   I wondered peevishly why they couldn't put her anywhere else instead
of quartering her on me. To get rid of her, I undressed quickly, extin-
guished my light, and went to bed. But, as I fell asleep, 1could not
forget that she was still there looking, " I s it really, though? I want to
know ;" and when I awoke in the night, I found that I was uneasily
asking all sorts of people in my dreams whether it really was or not-
without knowing what I meant.




                           CHAPTER XXI.


   THEREwas a servant in that house, a man who, I understood, was
usually with Steerforth, and had come into his service at the University,
who was in appearance a pattern of respectability. I believe there never
existed in his station a more respectable-looking man. He was taciturn,
soft-footed, very quiet in his manner, deferential, observant, always at
hand when wanted, and never near when not wanted; but his great claim
to consideration was his respectability. He had not a pliant face, he had
rather a stiff neck, rather a tight smooth head with short hair clinging to
it at the sides, a soft way of speaking, with a peculiar habit of whispering
the letter S so distinctly, that he seemed to use it oftener than any other
man; but every peculiarity that he had he made respectable. If his nose
had been upside-down, he would have made that respectable. H e sur-
rounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability, and walked secure
in it. I t would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything
wrong, he was so thoroughly respectable. Nobody could have thought of
putting him in a livery, he was so highly respectable. To have imposed
any derogatory work upon him, would have been to inflict a wanton insult
on the feelings of a most respectable man. And of this, I noticed the
women-servants in the household were so intuitively conscious, that they
always did such work themselves, and generally while he read the paper
by the pantry fire.
   Such a self-contained man I never saw. But in that quality, as in
every other he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable. Even
the fact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of
his respectability. Nothing could be objected against his surname Littimer,
by which he was known. Peter might have been hanged, or Tom trans-
ported ; but Littimer was perfectly respectable.
                                       P 2
212             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     I t was occasioned, I suppose, by the reverend nature of respectability
in the abstract, but I felt particularly young in this man's presence. How
old he was himself I could not guess-and that again went to his credit
on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability he might have
numbered fifty years as well as thirty.
     Littimer was in my room in the morning before I was up, to bring me
that reproachful shaving-water, and to put out my clothes. When I
undrew the curtains and looked out of bed, I saw him, in an equable
temperature of respectability, unaffected by the east wind of January, and
not even breathing frostily, standing my boots right and left in the first
dancing position, and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid i t down
like a baby.
     I gave him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was. H e
took out of his pocket thc most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, and
preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far, looked in at the
face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster, shut it up again, and said,
 if I pleased, it was halfpast eight.
      "Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested, sir."
      "Thank you," said I , "very well indeed. I s Mr. Steerforth quite well?"
      "Thank you, sir, Mr. Steerforth is tolerably well." Another of his
  characteristics,-no use of superlatives. A cool calm medium always.
      " I s there anything more I can have the honor of doing for you, sir?
  The warning-bell will ring at nine; the family take breakfast at halfpast
  nine."
       " Nothing, I thank you."
       '' I thank you, sir, if you please ;" and with that, and with a little inclina-
  tion of his head when he passed the bedside, as an apology for correcting
  me, he went out, shutting the door as delicately as if I had just fallen into
  a sweet sleep on which my life depended.
       Every morning we held exactly this conversation : never any more, and
  never any less : and yet, invariably, however far I might have been lifted
  out of myself over-night, and advanced towards maturer years, by Steer-
  forth's companionship, or Mrs. Steerforth's confidence, or Miss Dartle's
   conversation, in the presence of this most respectable man I became, as our
  smaller poets sing, " a boy again."
       H e got horses for u s ; and Steerforth, who knew every thing, gave me
  lessons in riding. H e provided foils for us, and Steerforth gave me
   lessons in fencing-gloves, and I began, of the same master, to improve
   in boxing. I t gave me no manner of concern that Steerforth should find
   me a novice in these sciences, but I never could bear to show my want of
   skill before the respectable Littimer. I had no reason to believe that
   Littimer understood such arts himself; he never led me to suppose any-
   thing of the kind, by so much as the vibration of one of his respectable
   eyelashes ; yet whenever he was by, while we were practising, I felt myself
   the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals.
        I am particular about this man, because he made a particular effect on
    me at that time, and because of what took place thereafter.
        The week passed away in a most delightful manner. I t passed rapidly,
    as may be supposed, to one entranced as I was; and yet it gave me so
    many occasions for knowing Steerforth better, and admiring him more in
    a thousand respects, that at its close I seemed to have been with him for
                        O F DAVID COPPERFIELD.

a much longer time. A dashing way he had of treating me like a play-
thing, was more agreeable to me than any behaviour he could have
adopted. I t reminded me of our old acquaintance ; it seemed the natural
sequel of it ; it showed me that he was unchanged ; it relieved me of any
uneasiness I might have felt, in comparing my merits with his, and mea-
suring my claims upon his friendship by any equal standard; above all, it
was a familiar, unrestrained, affectionate demeanor that he used towards
no one else. As he had treated me at school differently from all the rest,
I joyfully believed that he treated me in life unlike any other friend he
had. I believed that I was nearer to his heart than any other friend, and
my own heart warmed with attachment to him.
   He made up his mind to go with me into the country, and the day
arrived for our departure. He had been doubtful at first whether to take
Littimer or not, but decided to leave him at home. The respectable
creature, satisfied with his lot whatever it was, arranged our portmanteaus
on the little carriage that was to take us into London, as if they were
intended to defy the shocks of ages; and received my modestly proffered
donation with perfect tranquillity.
   We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, with many thanks
on my part, and much kindness on the devoted mother's. The last
thing I saw was Littimer's unruffled eye ; fraught, as I fancied, with the
silent conviction that I was very young indeed.
   What I felt, in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places, I
shall not endeavour to describe. We went down by the Mail. I was so
concerned, I recollect, even for the honor of Yarmouth, that when Steer-
forth said, as we drove through its dark streets to the inn, that, as well as
he could make out, it was a good, queer, out-of-the-way kind of hole, I
was highly pleased. We went to bed on our arrival (I observed a pair of
dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend the Dolphin as
we passed that door), and breakfasted late in the morning. Steerforth,
who was in great spirits, had been strolling about the beach before I was
up, and had made acquaintance, he said, with half the boatmen in the
place. Moreover he had seen, in the distance, what he was sure must be
the identical house of Mr. Peggotty, with smoke coming out of the
chimney; and had had a great mind, he told me, to walk in and swear he
was myself grown out of knowledge.
   "When do you propose to introduce me there, Daisy ?" he said. "I am
at your disposal. Make your own arrangements."
   " Why, I was thinking that this evening would be a good time, Steer-

forth, when they are all sitting round the fire. I should like you to see it
when it's snug, it's such a curious place."
   " So be it !" returned Steerforth. " This evening."
   " I shall not give them any notice that we are here, you know," said I,
delighted. "We must take them by surprise."
   " Oh, of course !   It's no fun," said Steerforth, " unless we take them
by surprise. Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition."
    " Though they are that sort of people that you mentioned," I returned.

   "Aha! What! you recollect my skirmishes with Rosa, do you?" he
exclaimed with a quick look. " Confound the girl, I am half afraid of her.
She's like a goblin to me. But never mind her. Now what are you
going to d o ? You are going to see your nurse, I suppose?"
214          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  " Why, yes," I said, " I must see Peggotty first of all."
  " Well," replied Steerforth, looking at his watch. " Suppose I deliver
you up to be cried over for a couple of hours. I s that long enough?"
    I answered, laughing, that I thought we might get through it in that
time, but that he must come also; for he would find that his renown
had preceded him, and that he was almost as great a personage as I was.
    " I'll come anywhere you like," said Steerforth, " or do anything you
like. Tell me where to come to ; and in two hours I'll produce myself
in any state you please, sentimental or comical."
    I gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. Barkis,
carrier to Blunderstone and elsewhere, and, on this understanding, went out
alone. There was a sharp bracing air; the ground was dry; the sea
was crisp and clear ; the sun was diffusing abundance of light, if not much
warmth; and everything was fresh and lively. I was so fresh and lively
myself, in the pleasure of being there, that I could have stopped the
people in the streets and shaken hands with them.
    The streets looked small, of course. The streets that we have only seen
as children, always do, I believe, when we go back to them. But I had
forgotten nothing in them, and found nothing changed, until I came to
Mr. Omer's shop. OMERAND JORAM             was now written up, where OMER
used to be; but the inscription, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER,
BUNERAL      FURNISHER,    &c., remained as it was.
    My footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop-door, after I had
read these words from over the way, that I went across the road and looked
 in. There was a pretty woman at the back of the shop, dancing a little
 child in her arms, while another little fellow clung to her apron. I had no
 difficulty in recognising either Minnie or Minnie's children. The glass-
 door of the parlor was not open ; but in the workshop across the yard I
 could faintly hear the old tune playing, as if it had never left off.
    "Is Mr. Omer at home?" said I, entering. " I should like to see him,
 for a moment, if he is."
     " Oh yes, sir, he is at home," said Minnie; "this weather don't suit
 his asthma out of doors. Joe, call your grandfather ! "
    The little fellow, who was holding her apron, gave such a lusty shout,
that the sound of it made him bashful, and he buried his face in her skirts,
to her great admiration. I heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming
 towards us, and soon Mr. Omer, shorter-winded than of yore, but not
much older-looking, stood before me.
    " Servant, sir," said Mr. Omer. " What can I do for you, sir? "
    " You can shake hands with me, Mr. Omer, if you please," said I,
putting out my own. "You were very good-natured to me once, when I
 am afraid I didn't show that I thought so."
    "Was I though? " returned the old man. " I ' m glad to hear it,
 but I don't remember when. Are you sure it was me? "
    " Quite."
    " I think my memory has got as short as my breath," said Mr. Omer,
 looking at me and shaking his head ; "for I don't remember you."
     "Don't you remember your coming to the coach to meet me, and my
  having breakfast here, and our riding out to Blunderstone together:
  you, and I, and Mrs. Joram, and Mr. Joram too-who wasn't her
 husband then ? "
                       OF DAVID COPPERPIELD.

   " Why, Lord bless my soul ! " exclaimed Mr. Omer, after being thrown

by his surprise into a fit of coughing, " you don't say so ! Minnie, my
dear, you recollect ? Dear me, yes-the party was a lady, I think ? "
   " My mother," I rejoined.
   " To-be-sure,"       said Mr. Omer, touching my waistcoat with his
forefinger, " and there was a little child too ! There was two parties.
The little party was laid along with the other party. Over at Blunder-
stone it was, of course. Dear me ! And how have you been since ? "
   Very well, I thanked him, as I hoped he had been too.
   " Oh ! nothing to grumble at, you know," said Mr. Omer. " I find
my breath gets short, but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older. I
take it as it comes, and make the most of it. That's the best way,
ain't it ? "
   Mr. Omer coughed again, in consequence of laughing, and was assisted
out of his fit by his daughter, who now stood close beside us, dancing her
smallest child on the counter.
   " Dear me ! " said Mr. Omer. " Yes, to be sure. Two parties !
Why, in that very ride, if you'll believe me, the day was named for my
Minnie to marry Joram. 'Do name it, sir,' says Joram. 'Yes, do,
father,' says Minnie. And now he's come into the business. And look
here ! The youngest ! "
   Minnie laughed, and stroked her banded hair upon her temples, as her
father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing
on the counter.
   " Two parties, of course ! " said M i . Omer, nodding his head retro-

spectively. " Ex-actly so ! And Joram 's at work, at this minute, on a
grey one with silver nails, not this measurement "-the measurement of
the dancing child upon the counter-" by a good two inches.-Will you
take something? "
   I thanked him, but declined.
   "Let me see," said Mr. Omer. " Barkis's the carrier's wife-Peg-
gotty 's the boatman's sister-she had something to do with jour family?
She was in service there, sure ? "
   My answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction.
   " I believe my breath will get long next, my memory's getting so
much so," said Mr. Omer. "Well, sir, we 've got a young relation of
hers here, under articles to us, that has as elegant a taste in the dress-
making business-I assure you I don't believe there's a Duchess in
England can touch her."
   " Not little Em'ly ? " said I, involuntarily.

   " Em'ly 's her name," said Mr. Omer, " and she's little too.       But if
you 1' 1 believe me, she has such a face of her own that half the women in
this town are mad against her."
   " Nonsense, father ! " cried Minnie.
   " My dear," said Mr. Omer, "I don't say it's the case with you,"

winking at me, " but I say that half the women in Yarmouth-ah ! and
in five mile round-are mad against that girl."
   "Then she should have kept to her own station in life, father," said
Minnie, " and not have given them any hold to talk about her, and then
they couldn't have done it."
   " Couldn't have done it, my dear ! " retorted Mr. Omer. '' Couldn't
216           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  have done it ! I s that your knowledge of life? What is there that any
  woman couldn't do, that she shouldn't do-especially on the subject of
  another woman's good looks ? "
     I really thought it was all over with Mr. Omer, after he had uttered
  this libellous pleasantry. He coughed to that extent, and his breath
  eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy, that I fully
  expected to see his head go down behind the counter, and his little black
  breeches, with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees, come
  quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle. At length, however, he got
 better, though he still panted hard, and was so exhausted that he was
  obliged to sit on the stool of the shop-desk.
     " You see," he said, wiping his head, and breathing with difficulty,

  " she hasn't taken much to any companions here ; she hasn't taken kindly

 to any particular acquaintances and friends, not to mention sweethearts.
 I n consequence, an ill-natured story got about, that Em'ly wanted to be
 a lady. Now my opinion is, that it came into circulation principally on
 account of her sometimes saying, at the school, that if she was a lady she
 would like to do so and so for her uncle-don't      you see ?-and buy him
 such and such fine things."
     " I assure you, Mr. Omer, she has said so to me," I returned eagerly,
 '< when we were both children."
     Mr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin. " Just so. Then out
 of a very little, she could dress herself, you see, better than most others
 could out of a deal, and that made things unpleasant. Moreover, she was
 rather what might be called wayward-I '11 go so far as to say what I
 should call wayward myself," said Mr. Omer, "-didn't     know her own mind
 quite-a little spoiled-and couldn't, at first, exactly bind herself down.
 No more than that was ever said against her, Minnie ?"
     " No, father," said Mrs. Joram.    " That's the worst, I believe."
     " So when she got a situation," said Mr. Omer, " to keep a fractious
 old lady company, they didn't very well agree, and she didn't stop. At
last she came here, apprenticed for three years. Nearly two of 'em are
over, and she has been as good a girl as ever was. Worth any six !
Minnie, is she worth any six, now ? "
     " Yes, father," replied Minnie.   "Never say I detracted from her ! "
    "Very good," said Mr. Omer. "That 's right. And so, young gentle-
man," he added, after a few moments' further rubbing of his chin, " that
you may not consider me long-winded as well as short-breathed, I believe
that 's all about it."
    As they had spoken in a subdued tone, while speaking of Em'ly, I had
no doubt that she was near. On my asking now, if that were not so,
Mr. Omer nodded yes, and nodded towards the door of the parlor. My
hurried inquiry if I might peep in, was answered with a free permission ;
and, looking through the glass, I saw her sitting at her work. I saw her, a
most beautiful little creature, with the cloudless blue eyes, that had looked
into my childish heart, turned laughingly upon another child of Minnie's
who was playing near her; with enough of wilfulness in her bright face
to justify what I had heard; with much of the old capricious coyness
lurking in it ; but with nothing in her pretty looks, I am sure, but what
was meant for goodness and for happiness, and what was on a good and
happy course.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    The tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left off-alas ! it
 was the tune that never does leave off-was beating, softly, all the while.
    "Wouldn't you like to step in," said Mr. Omer, "and speak to her ?
 Walk in and speak to her, sir ! Make yourself at home ! "
    I was too bashful to do so then-I was afraid of confusing her, and I
 was no less afraid of confusing myself: but I informed myself of the hour
 at which she left of an evening, in order that our visit might be timed
  accordingly ; and taking leave of Mr. Omer, and his pretty daughter, and
 her little children, went away to my dear old Peggotty's.
    Here she was, in the tiled kitchen, cooking dinner ! The moment I
  knocked at the door she opened it, and asked me what I pleased to want.
 I looked at her with a smile, but she gave me no smile in return. I had
 never ceased to write to her, but it must have been seven years since we
 had met.
    " Is Mr. Barkis at home, ma'am?" I said, feigning to speak roughly to her.

    "He's at home, sir," returned Peggotty, " but he's bad abed with the
 rheumatics."
    " Don't he go over to Blunderstone now ? " I asked.

    "When he 's well, he do," she answered.
    " Do you ever go there, Mrs. Barkis ? "

    She looked at me more attentively, and I noticed a quick movement of
 her hands towards each other.
    "Because I want to ask a question about a house there, that they call
 the-what is it ?-the Rookery," said I.
    She took a step backward, and put out her hands in an undecided
 frightened way, as if to keep me off.
    " Peggotty ! " I cried to her.

    She cried, " My darling boy ! " and we both burst into tears, and were
locked in one another's arms.
    What extravagancies she committed; what laughing and crying over
 me; what pride she showed, what joy, what sorrow that she whose pride
and joy I might have been, could never hold me in a fond embrace ; I have
not the heart to tell. I was troubled withno misgiving that it was young
in me to respond to her emotions. I had never laughed and cried in all
my life, I dare say-not even to her-more freely than I did that morning.
    "Barkis will be so glad," said Peggotty, wiping her eyes with her
apron, "that it 1' 1 do him more good than pints of liniment. May I go
and tell him yon are here? Will you come up and see him, my dear? "
    Of course I would. But Peggotty could not get out of the room as
easily as she meant to, for as often as she got to the door and looked
round at me, she came back again to have another laugh and another cry
upon my shoulder. At last, to make the matter easier, I went up-stairs
with her ; and having waited outside for a minute, while she said a word of
preparation to Mr. Barkis, presented myself before that invalid.
    H e received me with absolute enthusiasm. He was too rheumatic to be
shaken hands with, but he begged me to shake the tassel on the top of his
nightcap, which I did most cordially. When I sat down by the side of
the bed, he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was driving
me on the Blunderstone road again. As he lay in bed, face upward, and so
covered, with that exception, that he seemed to be nothing but a face-
like a conventional cherubim,-he looked the queerest object I ever beheld.
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    "What name was it, as I wrote up, in the cart, sir?" said Mr. Barkis,
with a slow rheumatic smile.
    "Ah! Mr. Barkis, we had some grave talks about that matter,hadnYtwe?'"
    " I was willin' a long time, sir? " said Mr. Barkis.
    " A long time," said I.
    "And I don't regret it," said Mr. Barkis. "Do you remember what
you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all
the cooking ?"
    " Yes, very well," I returned.
    " It was as true," said Mr. Barkis, as turnips is. I t was as true,"
                                       '(

said Mr. Barkis, nodding his nightcap, which was his only means of
emphasis, " as taxes is. And nothing 's truer than them."
    Mr. Barkis turned his eyes upon me, as if for my assent to this result
of his reflections in bed ; and I gave it.
    " Nothing 's truer than them," repeated Mr. Barkis; " a man as poor as

I am finds that out in his mind when he 's laid up. I 'm a very poor
man, sir."
    <' I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis."
    cr A very poor man, indeed I am," said Mr. Barkis.
    Here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes,
and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was
loosely tied to the side of the bed. After some poking about with this
instrument, in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted
expressions, Mr. Barkis poked it against a box, an end of which had been
visible to me all the time. Then his face became composed.
    " Old clothes," said Mr. Barkis.
    " Oh !" said I.
    " I wish it was Money, sir," said Mr. Barkis.
    " I wish it was, indeed," said I.
    "But it AIN'T," said Mr. Barkis, opening both his eyes as wide as he
possibly could.
    I expressed myself quite sure of that, and Mr. Barkis, turning his eyes
more gently to his wife, said :
    " She's the usefullest and best of women, C. P. Barkis. All the praise
that any one can give to C. P. Barkis, she deserves, and more ! My dear,
you'll get a dinner to-day, for company; something good to eat and
 drink, will you ? "
    I should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration in my
honor, but that I saw Peggotty, on the opposite side of the bed, extremely
 anxious I should not. So I held my peace.
    "I have got a trifle of money somewhere about me, my dear," said Mr.
Barkis, "but I ' m a little tired. If you and Mr. David will leave me for
a short nap, I ' l l try and find it when I wake."
    We left the room, in compliance with this request. When we got out-
 side the door, Peggotty informed me that Mr. Barkis, being now "a little
 nearer" than he used to be, always resorted to this same device before
 producing a single coin from his store; and that he endured unheard-of
 agonies in crawling out of bed alone, and taking it from that unlucky box.
 I n effect, we presently heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most
 dismal nature, as this magpie proceeding racked him in every joint ; but
 while Peggotty's eyes were full of compassion for him, she said his
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           219

generous impulse would do him good, and it was better not to check it.
So he groaned on, until he had got into bed again, suffering, I have no
doubt, a martyrdom; and then called us in, pretending to have just woke
u p from a refreshing sleep, and to produce a guinea from under his pillow.
His satisfaction in which happy imposition on us, and in having preserved
the impenetrable secret of the box, appeared to be a sufficient compensa-
tion to him for all his tortures.
   I prepared Peggotty for Steerforth's arrival, and it was not long before
he came. I am persuaded she knew no difference between his having
been a personal benefactor of hers, and a kind friend to me, and that she
would have received him with the utmost gratitude and devotion in any
case. But his easy, spirited, good humour ; his genial manner, his hand-
some looks, his natural gift of adapting himself to whomsoever he pleased,
and making direct, when he cared to do it, to the main point of interest
in anybody's heart; bound her to him wholly in five minutes. His
manner to me, alone, would have won her. But, through all these causes
combined, I sincerely believe she had a kind of adoration for him before
he left the house that night.
   H e stayed there with me to dinner-if I were to say willingly, I should
not half express how readily and gaily. H e went into Mr. Barkis's room
like light and air, brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy
weather. There was no noise, no effort, no consciousness, in anything
he did ; but in everything an indescribable lightness, a seeming impossi-
bility of doing anything else, or doing anything better, which was so
graceful, so natural, and agreeable, that it overcomes me, even now, in
the remembrance.
   We made merry in the little parlor, where the Book of Martyrs, un-
thumbed since my time, was laid out upon the desk as of old, and where
I now turned over its terrific pictures, remembering the old sensations
they had awakened, but not feeling them. When Peggotty spoke of what
she called my room, and of its being ready for me at night, and of her
hoping I would occupy it, before I could so much as look at Steerforth,
hesitating, he was possessed of the whole case.
   " Of course," he said.    " You '11 sleep here, while we stay, and I shall
sleep at the hotel."
   "But to bring you so far," I returned, " and to separate, seems bad
companionship, Steerforth."
   "Why, in the name of Heaven, where do you naturally belong ! " he
said. "What is 'seems,' compared to that ! " I t was settled at once.
   H e maintained all his delightful qualities to the last, until we started
forth, at eight o'clock, for Mr. Peggotty's boat. Indeed, they were more
and more brightly exhibited as the hours went on; for I thought even
then, and I have no doubt now, that the consciousness of success in his
determination to please, inspired him with a new delicacy of perception,
 and made it, subtle as it was, more easy to him. If any one had told
me, then, that all this was a brilliant game, played for the excitement of
the moment, for the employment of high spirits, in the thoughtless love of
superiority, in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what was
worthless to him, and next minute thrown away-I say, if any one had
told me such a lie that night, I wonder in what manner of receiving it
my indignation would have found a vent !
220            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    Probably only in an increase, had that been possible, of the romantic
 feelings of fidelity and friendship with which I walked beside him, over
 the dark wintry sands, towards the old boat; the wind sighing around
us even more mournfully, than it had sighed and moaned upon the night
when I first darkened Mr. Peggotty's door.
    "This is a wild kind of place, Steerforth, is it not ? "
    " Dismal enough in the dark," he said ; " and the sea roars as if it were
hungry for us. Is that the boat, where I see a light yonder ? "
    " That's the boat," said I.

    "And it's the same I saw this morning," he returned. " I came
straight to it, by instinct, I suppose."
    We said no more as we approached the light, but made softly for the
door. I laid my hand upon the latch ; and whispering Steerforth to keep
close to me, went in.
    A murmur of voices had been audible on the outside, and, at the
moment of our entrance, a clapping of hands : which latter noise, I was
surprised to see, proceeded from the generally disconsolateMrs. Gummidge.
But Mrs. Gummidge was not the only person there, who was unusually
excited. Mr. Peggotty, his face lightedup with uncommon satisfaction, and
laughing with all his might, held his rough arms wide open, as if for little
Em'ly to run into them; Ham, with a mixed expression in his face of
admiration, exultation, and a lumbering sort of bashfulness that sat upon
him very well, held little Em'ly by the hand, as if he were presenting her
to Mr. Peggotty ; little Em'ly herself, blushing and shy, but delighted with
Mr. Peggotty's delight, as her joyous eyes expressed, was stopped by our
entrance (for she saw us first) in the very act of springing from Ham to
nestle in Mr. Peggotty's embrace. I n the first glimpse we had of them all,
and at the moment of our passing from the dark cold night into the warm
light room, this was the way in which they were all employed: Mrs.
Gummidge in the back ground, clapping her hands like a madwoman.
    The little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in, that
one might have doubted whether it had ever been. I was in the midst of
the astonished family, face to face with Mr. Peggotty, and holding out my
hand to him, when Ham shouted :
    " Mas'r Davy ! I t 's Mas'r Davy !"
    I n a moment we were all shaking hands with one another, and asking
one another how we did, and telling one another how glad we were to
meet, and all talking at once. Mr. Peggotty was so proud and over-
joyed to see us, that he did not know what to say or do, but kept over and
over again shaking hands with me, and then with Steerforth, and then
with me, and then ruffling his shaggy hair all over his head, and laughing
with such glee and triumph, that it was a treat to see him.
    "Why, that you two gent'lmen-gent'lmen growed-should come to
this here roof to-night, of all nights in my life," said Mr. Peggotty, "is such
a thing as never happened afore, I do rightly believe ! Em'ly, my darling,
come here ! Come here, my little witch ! There's Mas'r Davy's friend,
 my dear ! There's the gent'lman as you 've heerd on, Em'ly. He comes
 to see you, along with Mas'r Davy, on the brightest night of your uncle's
 life as ever was or will be, Gorm the t'other one, and horroar for it ! "
    After delivering this speech all in a breath, and with extraordinary
 animation and pleasure, Mr. Peggotty put one of his large hands raptur-
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

ously on each side of his niece's face, and kissing it a dozen times, laid it
with a gentle pride and love upon his broad chest, and patted it as if his
hand had been a lady's. Then he let her go; and as she ran into the
little chamber where I used to sleep, looked round upon us, quite hot
and out of breath with his uncommon satisfaction.
    " If you two gent'lmen-gent'lmen growed now, and such gent'lmen-"
said Mr. Peggotty.
    " SO th 'are, so th 'are ! " cried Ham. "Well said ! So th 'are. Mas'r
Davy bor-gent'lmen growed-so th'are ! "
    " If you two gent'lmen, gent'lmen growed," said Mr. Peggotty, "don't

ex-cuse me for being in a state of mind, when you understand matters,
I'll arks your pardon. Em'ly, my dear !-She knows I 'm a going to tell,"
here his delight broke out again, " and has made off. Would you be so
good as look arter her, Mawther, for a minute ? "
    Mrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared.
    " If this ain't," said Mr. Peggotty, sitting down among us by the fire,
" the brightest night o' my life, I ' m a shellfish-biled too-and more I
can't say. This here little Em'ly, sir," in a low voice to Steerforth, 'r -her
as you see a blushing here just now-"
    Steerforth only nodded ; but with such a pleased expression of interest,
and of participation in Mr. Peggotty's feelings, that the latter answered
him as if he had spoken.
    " To be sure," said Mr. Peggotty. " That's her, and so she is.
Thankee, sir."
    Ham nodded to me several times, as if he would have said so too.
    " This here little Em'ly of ours," said Mr. Peggotty, "has been, in our
 house, what I suppose (I 'm a ignorant man, but that's my belief) no one
 but a little bright-eyed creetur calz be in a house. She ain't my child; I
 never had one; but I couldn't love her more. You understand ! I
 couldn't do it ! "
     " I quite understand," said Steerforth.

    "I know you do, sir," returned Mr. Peggotty, " and thankee again.
 Mas'r Davy, he can remember what she was ; you may judge for your
 own self what she is ; but neither of you can't fully know what she has
 been, is, and will be, to my loving art. I am rough, sir," said Mr. Peg-
 gotty, " I am as rough as a Sea Porkypine ; but no one, unless, mayhap,
 it is a woman, can know, I think, what our little Em'ly is to me. And
 betwixt ourselves," sinking his voice lower yet, "that woman's name
 ain't Missis Gummidge neither, though she has a world of merits."
     Mr. Peggotty ruffled his hair again with both hands, as a further pre-
 paration for what he was going to say, and went on with a hand upon
 each of his knees.
     "There was a certain person as had know'd our Em'ly, from the time
 when her father was drownded; as had seen her constant; when a babby,
 when a young gal, when a woman. Not much of a person to look at, he
 warn't," said Mr. Peggotty, "something o' my own build-rough-a
 good deal oJ the sou'-wester in him-wery salt-but, on the whole, a
 honest sort of a chap, with his art in the right place."
     I thought I had never seen Ham grin to anything like the extent to
 which he sat grinning at us now.
     "What does this here blessed tarpaulin go and do," said Mr. Peggotty,
222           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

with his face one high noon of enjoyment, "but he loses that there art
of his to our little Em'ly. H e follers her about, he makes hisself a sort
0' servant to her, he loses in a great measure his relish for his wittles,
and in the long run he makes it clear to me wot 's amiss. Now I could
wish myself, you see, that our little Em'ly was in a fair way of being
married. I could wish to see her, at all ewents, under articles to a honest
man as had a right to defend her. I don't know how long I may live,
or how soon I may die; but I know that if I was capsized, any night, in
a gale of wind in Yarmouth Roads here, and was to see the town-lights
shining for the last time over the rollers as I couldn't make no head
against, I could go down quieter for thinking 'There's a man ashore
there, iron-true to my little Em'ly, God bless her, and no wrong can
touch my Em'ly while so be as that man lives ! ' "
   Mr. Peggotty, in simple earnestness, waved his right arm, as if he
were waving it at the town-lights for the last time, and then, exchanging
a nod with Ham, whose eye he caught, proceeded as before.
   "Well! I counsels him to speak to Em'ly. He's big enough, but
he's bashfuller than a little un, and he don't like. So I speak. 'What !
H i m !' says Em'ly. 'Him that I 've know'd so intimate so many years,
and like so much! Oh, Uncle! I never can have him. He's such a
good fellow !' I gives her a kiss, and I says no more to her than My
dear, you're right to speak out, you're to choose for yourself, you 're as
free as a little bird.' Then I aways to him, and I says, 'I wish it could
have been so, but it can't. But you can both be as you was, and wot I
say to you is, Be as you was with her, like a man.' H e says to me, a
shaking of my hand, 'I will! ' he says. And he was-honorable and
manful-for two year going on, and we was just the same at home here as
afore."
   Mr. Peggotty's face, which had varied in its expression with the
various stages of his narrative, now resumed all its former triumphant
delight, as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon Steerforth's
(previously wetting them both, for the greater emphasis of the action),
and divided the following speech between us :
    " All of a sudden, one evening-as it might be to-night-comes little
Em'ly from her work, and him with her ! There ain't so much in that,
you 'll say. No, because he takes care on her, like a brother, arter dark,
and indeed afore dark, and at all times. But this tarpaulin chap, he takes
hold of her hand, and he cries out to me, joyful, 'Look here ! This is to
be my little wife ! ' And she says, half bold and half shy, and half a
laughing and half a crying, 'Yes, uncle ! If you please.'-If    I please! "
cried Mr. Peggotty, rolling his head in an ecstacy at the idea; "Lord, as
if I should do anythink else !-' If you please, I am steadier now, and I
have thought better of it, and I'll be as good a little wife as I can to
him, for he 's a dear, good fellow ! ' Then Missis Gummidge, she claps
her hands like a play, and you come in. There ! the murder's out ! " said
Mr. Peggotty-"You       come in! It took place this here present hour; and
here 's the man that '11 marry her, the minute she's out of her time."
    Ham staggered, as well he might, under the blow Mr. Peggotty dealt him
in his unbounded joy, as a mark of confidence and friendship ; but feeling
 called upon to say something to us, he said, with much faltering and
 great difficulty :
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                              223
    " She warn't no higher than you was, Mas'r Davy-when            you first come
-when I thought what she 'd grow up to be. I see her grow up-
gent'lmen-like a flower. I 'dlay down my life for her-Mas'r                Davy-
Oh ! most content and cheerful ! She 's more to me-gent'lmen-than-
she's all to me that ever I can want, and more than ever I-than ever I
could say. I-Ilove her true. There ain't a gent'lman in all the land-
nor yet sailing upon all the sea-that can love his lady more than I love her,
though there 's many a common man-would say better-what he meant."
    I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as Ham was now,
trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature who
had won his heart. I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by
Mr. Peggotty and by himself, was, in itself, affecting. I was affected by
the story altogether. How far my emotions were influenced by the recol-
lections of my childhood, I don't know. Whether I had come there with
any lingering fancy that I was still to love littleEm'ly,I don't know. I know
that I was filled with pleasure by all this ; but, at first, with an indescribably
sensitive pleasure, that a very little would have changed to pain.
    Therefore, if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing chord
among them with any skill, I should have made a poor hand of it. But
it depended upon Steerforth; and he did it with such address, that in a
few minutes we were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be.
    " Mr. Peggotty,"      he said, "you are a thoroughly good fellow, and
deserve to be as happy as you are to-night. My hand upon it ! Ham,
I give you joy, my boy. My hand upon that, too ! Daisy, stir the fire, and
make it a brisk one! and Mr. Peggotty, unless you can induce your
gentle niece to come back (for whom I vacate this seat in the corner), I
 shall go. Any gap at your fireside on such a night-such a gap least
of all-I wouldn't make, for the wealth of the Indies ! "
    So Mr. Peggotty went into my old room to fetch little Em'ly. At
first little Em'ly didn't like to come, and then I-Iam went. Presently
they brought her to the fireside, very much confused, and very shy,-but
she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respect-
fully Steerforth spoke to her ; how skilfully he avoided anything that would
 embarrass her; how he talked to Mr. Peggotty of boats, and ships, and
 tides, and fish; how he referred to me about the time when he had seen
 Mr. Peggotty at Salem House; how delighted he was with the boat and
 all belonging to it ; how lightly and easily he carried on, until he brought
 us, by degrees, into a charmed circle, and we were all talking away
 without any reserve.
    Em'ly, indeed, said little all the evening ; but she looked, and listened,
 and her face got animated, and she was charming. Steerforth told a story
 of a dismal shipwreck (which arose out of his talk with Mr. Peggotty), as
if he saw it all before him-and little Em'ly's eyes were fastened on him
 all the time, as if she saw it too. He told us a merry adventure of his own,
 as a relief to that, with as much gaiety as if the narrative were as fresh to
 him as it was to us-and little Em'ly laughed until the boat rang with
 the musical sounds, and we all laughed (Steerforth too), in irresistible
 sympathy with what was so pleasant and light-hearted. He got Mr.
 Peggotty to sing, or rather to roar, " When the stormy winds do blow,
 do blow, do blow; " and he sang a sailor's song himself, so pathetically
 and beautifully, that I could have almost fancied that the real wind
224            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 creeping sorrowfully round the house, and murmuring low through our
 unbroken silence, was there to listen.
    As to hbs. Gummidge, he roused that victim of despondency with a
 success never attained by any one else (so Mr. Peggotty informed me) since
 the decease of the old one. H e left her so little leisure for being miserable
 that she said next day she thought she must have been bewitched.
    But he set up no monopoly of the general attention, or the conversa-
 tion. When little Em'ly grew more courageous, and talked (but still
 bashfully) across the fire to me, of our old wanderings upon the beach, to
 pick up shells and pebbles; and when I asked her if she recollected how
 I used to be devoted to her ; and when we both laughed and reddened,
 casting these looks back on the pleasant old times, so unreal to look at now ;
 he was silent and attentive, and observed us thoughtfully. She sat, at
 this time, and all the evening, on the old locker in her old little corner
by the fire-Ham beside her, where I used to sit. I could not satisfy
 myself whether it was in her own little tormenting way, or in a maidenly
reserve before us, that she kept quite close to the wall, and away from
 him ; but I observed that she did so, all the evening.
    As I remember, it was almost midnight when we took our leave. We
 had had some biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth had pro-
 duced from his pocket a full flask of Hollands, which we men (I may say
 we men, now, without a blush) had emptied. We parted merrily; and
as they all stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could
upon our road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em'ly peeping after
us, from behind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful
how we went.
    " A most engaging little Beauty ! " said Steerforth, taking my arm.

 "Well ! It's a quaint place, and they are quaint company, and it's quite
a new sensation to mix with them."
    " How fortunate we are, too," I returned, " to have arrived to witness

their happiness in that intendedmarriage ! I never saw people so happy.
How delightful to see it, and to be made the sharers in their honest
joy, as wehave been! "
    "That's rather a chnckle-headed fellow for the girl; isn't h e ? " said
Steerforth.
    H e had been so hearty with him, and with them all, that I felt a shock
in this unexpected and cold reply. But turning quickly upon him, and
seeing a laugh in his eyes, I answered, much relieved :
    "Ah, Steerforth ! It's well for you to joke about the poor ! You
may skirmish with Miss Dartle, or try to hide your sympathies in jest
from me, but I know better. When I see how perfectly you understand
them, how exquisitely you can enter into happiness like this plain
fisherman's, or humour a love like my old nurse's, I know that there is
not a joy or sorrow, not an emotion, of such people, that can be indifferent
to you. And I admire and love you for it, Steerforth, twenty times the
more ! "
    He stopped, and, looking in my face, said, "Daisy, I believe you are in
earnest, and are good. I wish we all were ! " Next moment he was
gaily singing Mr. Peggotty's song, as we walked at a round pace back to
Yarmouth.

T   H E peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to
      the Manufacture of Bedding, and consequently they are enabled to keep the
largest stock and greatest variety of any House in London, including their
              FRENCH W O O L MATTRESSES,
Of which they were the Original Introducers : these Mattresses are made of the
finest material, quite equal to the best made in Paris. Also,
             GERMAN SPRING MATTRESSES.
  These HEAL and SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are selling at a
much lower price than any other house, and can recommend one of them, with a
FRENCH MATTRESS on the top, as a permanently elastic, soft, and most
luxurious Bed.
                  THE EIDER DOWN QUILT
also, is to be seen only a t their House. It is the warmest, the lightest, and the
most elegant covering ever introduced, suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the
Carriage. All who have travelled on the Continent are aware that no covering
produces such extreme warmth with the same weight ; so that for Invalids they are
a perfect luxury. Their
                            BED FEATHERS
are also PURIFIED BY STEAM, W I T H PATENT MACHINERY, by which
the offensive properties of the quill are evaporated and carried off, without subjecting
the Feathers to the unpleasant smell of the stove, to which all Feathers dressed in
the ordinary way are liable.

                                     BY MRS. EVERETT GREEN.
           Editor of the "Letters of Royal andIllustrious Ladies."   2 vols.   with Portraits, 21s. bound.
                                                 (Now Ready.)
    The very title of this work can scarcely fail t o bespeak for it a hearty welcome. Regal biographies, unfolding
the domestic life of thosewho are usually only seen through the veil of stately ceremonial, are always perused
with interest, particularly if their subjects have been comparatively unknown. The present series of Memoirs
comprises only one individual-Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, daughter of James I.-of whom no biography
has hitherto been published ; indeed, little more is generally known of the English Princesses than their names
and marriages. To bring t o light from the obscurity in which they have so long been involved, the private as
well a s public lives of these illustrious ladies, is the object of the present work. The biographies embrace
t h e most stirring periods of English history, and a s the marriages of these regal ladies carried them into
foreign lands, the readers will be introduced into almost every Court of Europe.

                 Mr. M. A. TITMARSH'S
        NEW ROMAUNT OF T H E DAYS OF CHIVALRY.
MESSRS. CHAPMAN AND HALL have the pleasure to announce for
               Christmas, the publication of a highly Chivalrous Legend by the above author, entitled,

      REBECCA AND ROWENA;
                                   kl Xomance upon a8omance.
   A Story for Christmas (and indeed a n y other season,) containing Perilous Adventures, Tremendous Battles,
Tender Love-making, Profound Historical Knowledge, and a (tolerably) happy ending. The whole illustrated
with woodcuts by RICHARDDOYLE.
   Those readers who saw in Fraser's Magazine some three years since the proposals for a continuation of
Ivanhoe, whlch were issued by t h e undersigned, very likely imagined that like a thousand magnificent rail-
road-projects and other schemes then rife, m y plan for a Walter-Scott-continuation and Isaac-of-Ynrk-and-
Ivanhoe Junction, was never t o be brought t o completion. But passing many hours o n t h e sofa of late, reco-
vering from a fever, and ordered by Dr. ELLIOTSON(whose skill and friendship rescued me from it1 ON N O
A C C O U N T to put pen t o paper, I, of course, wished to write immediately, for which I humbly ask t h e Doctor's
pardon.
   I t need scarcely be said that t h e humble artist who usually illustrates my works fell ill a t t h e sametime with
myself, and on trial his hand shook s o t h a t it was found impossible he could work for t h e present volume.

                  EDITED BY MRS. LOUDON.
          ASSISTED   BY THE MOST EMINENT WRITERS AND ARTISTS.



T H E want of a First Class Periodical adapted to the Tastes and Pursuits of
    Women having been constantly urged upon me, I have projected, with
an earnest desire for the Improvement and Elevation of the Female Character,
and in conjunction with some of the best names in Literature and Art-

 THE LADIES' COMPANION AT                     H O M E AND ABROAD.
   The first point will be to enforce the necessity of Mental Cultivation. I n
educating female children, we too often give an undue importance to
accomplishments, forgetting that they are the adjuncts, and not the prin-
cipal object ; only the garnishing to the solid food ; useful to make girls
agreeable in society ; but not enough to make them good wives and mothers,
or, a t any rate, valuable members of the community.
   The Influence of Women in Society, and the necessity for their mental
cultivation, are now generally acknowledged ; and the old fancy, that
learning must make women pedantic and disagreeable, is rapidly passing
away. I t is true that there are some pedantic women, who are exceedingly
disagreeable ; but are there not also pedantic men, who are just as much
so ? And yet no one, I believe, ever yet proposed to deny the benefit of
mental cultivation to all men, because the brains of some few are found
too weak to bear it.
   To make women agreeable social companions to their husbands and
other male relations, it is necessary for them to be acquainted with many
Matters of General Information, continually recurring in books and conver-
sation, which are not usually taught in girls' schools ; and it will be
endeavoured, in the present work, to give young persons such a Know-
ledge of the Arts and Sciences, and of Ancient and Modern Literature,
as will enable them to take an interest in subjects constantly spoken of,
without penetrating into the depths of profound learning.
    Next to mental cultivation we place those Household Duties and Useful
and Elegant Occupations, in which women ought particularly to excel. I t
is not enough for a woman to be the companion of her husband ; she must
be his helpmate ; the tutelary genius of his house : she must watch over
his domestic comforts while he is engaged in the fatiguing duties of active
life ; and above all, she must make home comfortable to him, whether she
does it merely by the careful performance of her household duties, or adds
to them the graces of elegant accomplishments.
  I t is not only the poor man's wife who must attend to her Household
Duties ; every woman has household duties to perform, though they vary
according to her rank in life ; and in no one can we see the arduous
duties of wife and mother more admirably carried out to their fullest extent
than in the bright example held out to us by the Greatest, the Noblest, the
most Honoured, and most Beloved Lady in the realm.
   One important feature of this work will be to Advocate the Causes of
those Females who are Compelled to Labour, either mentally or bodily, for
their daily bread ; and to suggest some Means of Employment for the
Orphans of Clergymen, Artists, Officers, &c., who are, perhaps, more to
be pitied than any other class; as to them the privations and mortifications
they undergo are doubly embittered by recollections of the delicacy with
which they were reared, and by the refined tastes and sensitive feelings
which are almost inseparable from the education they have received.
   There are, of course, many minor points to be attended to, as, the
 Garden ; the Poultry-Yard ; Designs for Furniture, Fashions, and Work ;
 Reviews of Books ; In-door Occupations and Amusements, and many other
incidental topics arising from circumstances, or from the wants or wishes
of our readers. The Illustrations will have frequent reference to the sub-
jects just enumerated, but they will also include delineations of whatever
may be considered distinguished for interest or beauty.
   It must not, however, be supposed that the present publication is to take
entirely a serious character; on the contrary, the aim will be to combine
amusement with instruction, and to make the lighter parts as entertaining
as the more important parts are solid and valuable.

                           CHAPTER XXII.
             SOME OLD SCENES, AND SOME NEW PEOPLE.

    STEERFORTH    and I stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the
country. We were very much together, I need not say ; but occasionally
we were asunder for some hours at a time. He was a good sailor, and I
was but an indifferent one; and when he went out boating with Mr.
Peggotty, which was a favorite amusement of his, I generally remained
ashore. My occupation of Peggotty's spare-room put a constraint upon
me, from which he was free : for, knowing how assiduously she attended
on Mr. Barkis all day, I did not like to remain out late at night; whereas
Steerforth, lying at the Inn, had nothing to consult but his own humour.
Thus it came about, that I heard of his making little treats for the fisher-
men at Mr. Peggotty's house of call, " The Willing Mind," after I was in
bed, and of his being afloat, wrapped in fisherman's clothes,whole moonlight
nights, and coming back when the morning tide was at flood. By this
time, however, I knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted
to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather, as in any other means of
excitement that presented itself freshly to him ; so none of his proceedings
surprised me.
    Another cause of our being sometimes apart, was, that I had naturally
an interest in going over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar
scenes of my childhood ; while Steerforth, after being there once, had
naturally no great interest in going there again. Hence, on three or four
days that I can at once recal, we went our several ways after an early
breakfast, and met again at a late dinner. I had no idea how he employed
his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he was very
popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively diverting himself
where another man might not have found one.
    For my own part, my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recal
every yard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old spots,
of which I never tired. I haunted them, as my memory had often done,
and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I
was far away. The grave beneath the tree, where both my parents lay-
on which I had looked out, when it was my father's only, with such curious
feelings of compassion, and by which I had stood, so desolate, when it was
opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby-the grave which
Peggotty's own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made a garden
of, I walked near, by the hour. It lay a little off the church-yard path,
in a quiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names upon the
 stone as I walked to and fro, startled by the sound of the church-bell when
 it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to me. My reflections
 at these times were always associated with the figure I was to make in
life, and the distinguished things I was to do. My echoing footsteps went
 to no other tune, but were as constant to that as if I had come home to
 build my castles in the air at a living mother's side.
                                                               Q
226           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   There were great changes in my old home. The ragged nests, so long
deserted by the rooks, were gone ; and the trees were lopped and topped
out of their remembered shapes. The garden had run wild, and half the
windows of the house were shut up. I t was occupied, but only by a poor
lunatic gentleman, and the people who took care of him. He was always
sitting at my little window, looking out into the church-yard; and I won-
dered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies
that used to occupy mine, on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of that
same little window in my night-clothes, and saw the sheep quietly feeding
in the light of the rising sun.
   Our old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America,
and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house, and
stained the outer walls. Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall, raw-
boned, high-nosed wife ; and they had a weazen little baby, with a heavy
head that it couldn't hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with which it
seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born.
   I t was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to
linger about my native place, until the reddening winter sun admonished
me that it was time to start on my returning walk. But, when the place
was left behind, and especially when Steerforth and I were happily seated
over our dinner by a blazing fire, it was delicious to think of having been
there. So it was, though in a softened degree, when I went to my neat
room at night ;and, turning over the leaves of the crocodile-book (which was
always there, upon a little table), remembered with a grateful heart how
blest I was in having such a friend as Steerforth, such a friend as Peggotty,
and such a substitute for what I had lost as my excellent and generous
aunt.
   My nearest way to Yarmouth, in coming back from these long balks,
was by a ferry. I t landed me on the flat between the town and the sea,
which I couldmake straight across, and so save myself a considerable circuit
by the high road. Mr. Peggotty's house being on that waste-place, and
not a hundred yards out of my track, I always looked in as I went by.
Steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me, and we went on
together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling
lights of the town.
    One dark evening, when I was later than usual-for I had, that day,
been making my parting visit to Blunderstone, as we were now about to
return home-I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty's house, sitting thought-
fully before the fire. He was so intent upon his own reflections that he
was quite unconscious of my approach. This, indeed, he might easily
have been if he had been less absorbed, for footsteps fell noiselessly
 on the sandy ground outside; but even my entrance failed to rouse
 him. I was standing close to him, looking at him ;and still, with a heavy
 brow, he was lost in his meditations.
    H e gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder, that he
 made me start too.
    "You come upon me," he said, almost angrily, "like a reproachful
 ghost ! "
    "I was obliged to announce myself somehow," I replied. "Have
 I called you down from the stars ? "
    " No," he answered.     "No."
                           OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

     "Up from anywhere, then? " said I, taking my seat near him.
     "I was looking at the pictures in the fire," he returned.
     "But you are spoiling them for me," said I, as he stirred it quickly
  with a piece of burning wood, striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks
  that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into the air.
     " You would not have seen them," he returned. " I detest this mongrel

 time, neither day nor night. How late you are ! Where have you been? "
     "I have been taking leave of my usual walk," said I.
    "And I have been sitting here," said Steerforth, glancing round the
 room, "thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our
 coming down, might-to judge from the present wasted air of the place-
 be dispersed, or dead, or come to I don't know what harm. David, I
 wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years ! "
    "My dear Steerforth, what is the matter ? "
    " I wish with all my soul I had been better guided!" he exclaimed.
 " I wish with all my soul I could guide myself better ! "
    There was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me.
 H e was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible.
    " I t would be better to be this poor Peggotty, or his lout of a
 nephew," he said, getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-
 piece, with his face towards the fire, '* than to be myself, twenty times
 richer and twenty times wiser, and be the torment to myself that I have
 been, in this Devil's bark of a boat, within the last half-hour ! "
    I was so confounded by the alteration in him, that at first I could only
 observe him in silence, as he stood leaning his head upon his hand, and
 looking gloomily down at the fire. At length I begged him, with all the
 earnestness I felt, to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually,
 and to let me sympathise with him, if I could not hope to advise him.
 Before I had well concluded, he began to laugh-fretfully at first, but
 soon with returning gaiety.
    " Tut, it's nothing, Daisy ! nothing ! " he replied.     " I told you, at
the inn in London, I am heavy company for myself, sometimes. I have
been a nightmare to myself, just now-must have had one, I think. At
 odd dull times, nursery tales come up into the memory, unrecognised for
what they are. I believe I have been confounding myself with the bad
 boy who ' didn't care,' and became food for lions-a grander kind of going
to the dogs, I suppose. What old women call the horrors, have been
 creeping over me from head to foot. I have been afraid of myself."
    "You are afraid of nothing else, I think," said I.
    "Perhaps not, and yet may have enough to be afraid of too,)' he
answered. " Well! So it goes by ! I am not about to be hipped again,
David; but I tell you, my good fellow, once more, that it would have
been well for me (and for more than me) if I had had a steadfast and
judicious father ! "
    His face was always full of expression, but I never saw it express such
a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words, with his glance
bent on the fire.
    " So much for that ! " he said, making as if he tossed something light
into the air, with his hand.
                 " 'Why,    being gone, I am a man again,'

like Macbeth. Andnow for dinner ! If I have not (Macbeth-like) broken
up the feast with most admired disorder, Daisy."
   " But where are they all, I wonder ! " said I.

   " God knows," said Steerforth. " After strolling to the ferry looking
for you, I strolled in here and found the place deserted. That set me
thinking, and you found me thinking."
   The advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket, explained how the house
had happened to be empty. She had hurried out to buy something that was
needed, against Mr. Peggotty's return with the tide; and had left the
door open in the meanwhile, lest Ham and little Em'ly, with whom it was
an early night, should come home while she was gone. Steerforth, after
very much improving Mrs. Gummidge's spirits by a cheerful salutation,
and a jocose embrace, took my arm, and hurried me away.
   H e had improved his own spirits, no less than Mrs. Gummidge's, for
they were again at their usual flow, and he was full of vivacious conversa-
tion as we went along.
   " And so," he said, gaily, " we abandon this buccaneer life to-morrow,

do we?"
   " So we agreed," I returned.   "And our places by the coach are taken,
you know."
   "Ay ! there 's no help for it, I suppose," said Steerforth. " I have
almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out
tossing on the sea here. I wish there was not."
   " As long as the novelty should last," said I, laughing.
   " Like enough," he returned; '< though there 's a sarcastic meaning in
that observation for an amiable piece of innocence like my young friend.
Well ! I dare say I am a capricious fellow, David. I know I am; but
while the iron is hot, I can strike it vigorously too. I could pass a
reasonably good examination already, as a pilot in these waters, I think."
   "Mr. Peggotty says you are a wonder," I returned.
   " A nautical phenomenon, eh? " laughed Steerforth.
   " Indeed he does, and you know how truly; knowing how ardent you

are in any pursuit you follow, and how easily you can master it. And
that amazes me most in vou. Steerforth-that vou should be contented
with such fitful uses of y&r iowers."
   " Contented ? " he answered, merrily. " I am never contented, except
with your freshness, my gentle Daisy. As to fitfulness, I have never
learnt the art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the Ixions
of these days are turning round andround. I missed it somehow in a bad
apprenticeship, and now don't care about it.-You know I have bought a
boat down here? "
   "What an extraordinary fellow you are, Steerforth!" I exclaimed,
stopping-for this was the first I had heard of it. "When you may
never care to come near the place again ! "
   " I don't know that," he returned. "I have taken a fancy to the place.
At all events," walking me briskly on, " I have bought a boat that was
for sale-a clipper, Mr. Peggotty says ; and so she is-and Mr. Peggotty
will be master of her in my absence."
   " Now I understand you, Steerforth ! " said I, exultingly. " You pre-

tend to have bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer
a benefit on him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

My dear kind Steerforth, how can I tell you what I think of your
generosity ? "
   " Tush I " he answered, turning red.    " The less said, the better."
   " Didn't I know? " cried I, " didn't I say that there was not a joy, or
sorrow, or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to you?"
   "Aye, aye," he answered, " you told me all that. There let it rest.
We have said enough ! "
   Afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light
of it, I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker
pace than before.
   " She must be newly rigged,"       said Steerforth, "and I shall leave
Littimer behind to see it done, that I may know she is quite complete.
Did I tell you Littimer had come down? "
   " No."

   "Oh, yes ! came down this morning, with a letter from my mother."
   As our looks met, I observed that he was pale even to his lips, though
he looked very steadily at me. I feared that some difference between him
and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which
I had found him at the solitary fireside. I hinted so.
   " Oh no ! " he said, shaking his head, and giving a slight laugh.

" Nothing of the sort ! Yes. He is come down, that man of mine."
   " The same as ever? " said I.

   " The same as ever," said Steerforth. "Distant and quiet as the North
Pole. He shall see to the boat being fresh named. She's the Stormy
Petrel now. What does Mr. Peggotty care for Stormy Petrels ! 1'11
have her christened again."
   " By what name? " I asked.
   " The Little Em'ly."
   As he had continued to look steadily at me, I took it as a reminder that
he objected to being extolled for his consideration. I could not help
showing in my face how much it pleased me, but I said little, and he
resumed his usual smile, and seemed relieved.
   " But see here," he said, looking before us, " where the original little
Em'ly comes ! And that fellow with her, eh ? Upon my soul, he' s a true
knight. He never leaves her ! "
   Ham was a boat-builder in these days, having improved a natural
ingenuity in that handicraft, until he had become a skilled workman. H e
was in his working-dress, and looked rugged enough, but manly withal,
and a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side. Indeed,
there was a frankness in his face, an honesty, and an undisguised show of
his pride in her, and his love for her, which were, to me, the best of good
looks. I thought, as they came towards us, that they were well matched
even in that particular.
   She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to
them, and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me. When they
passed on, after we had exchanged a few words, she did not like to replace
that hand, but, still appearing timid and constrained, walked by herself.
I thought all this very pretty and engaging, and Steerforth seemed to
think so too, as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young
moon.
   Suddenly there passed us-evidently following them-a young woman
230            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 whose approach we had not observed, but whose face I saw as she went
 by, and thought I had a faint remembrance of. She was lightly dressed ;
 looked bold, and haggard, and flaunting, and poor ; but seemed, for the
 time, to have given all that to the wind which was blowing, and to have
 nothing in her mind but going after them. As the dark distant level,
 absorbing their figures into itself, left but itself visible between us and the
 sea and clouds, her figure disappeared in like manner, still no nearer to
 them than before.
    "That is a black shadow to be following the girl," said Steerforth,
 standing still ; " what does it mean? "
    H e spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to me.
    " She must have it in her mind to beg of them, I think," said I.
    " A beggar would be no novelty," said Steerforth, " but it is a strange
 thing that the beggar should take that shape to-night."
    " Why? " I asked him.

    " For no better reason, truly, than because I was thinking," he said,
 after a pause, "of something like it, when it came by. Where the Devil
 did it come from, I wonder ! "
    " From the shadow of this wall, I think," said I, as we emerged upon
a road on which a wall abutted.
    " It's gone ! " he returned, looking over his shoulder. "And all ill
go with it. Now for our dinner ! "
    But, he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea-line glimmering
afar off; and yet again. And he wondered about it, in some broken
expressions, several times, in the short remainder of our walk; and only
 seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us,
 seated warm and merry, at table.
    Littimer was there, and had his usual effect upon me. When I said to
him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well, he answered
respectfully (and of course respectably), that they were tolerably well, he
thanked me, and had sent their compliments. This was all, and yet he
seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say : " You are very young,
sir ; you are exceedingly young."
    We had almost finished dinner, when taking a step or two towards the
table, from the corner where he kept watch upon us, or rather upon me,
as I felt, he said to his master:
    " I beg your pardon, sir.    Miss Mowcher is down here."
    "Who ? " cried Steerforth, much astonished.
    " Miss Mowcher, sir."
    " Why, what on earth does she do here?" said Steerforth.
    " I t appears to be her native part of the country, sir. She informs me
that she makes one of her professional visits here, every year, sir. I met
her in the street this afternoon, and she wished to know if she might have
the honor of waiting on you after dinner, sir."
    "Do you know the Giantess in question, Daisy ? " inquired Steerforth.
    I was obliged to confess-I felt ashamed, even of being at this dis-
advantage before Littimer-that          Miss Mowcher and I were wholly
unacquainted.
    "Then you shall know her," said Steerforth, "for she is one of
the seven wonders of the world. When Miss Mowcher comes, show
her in."
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           231
    I felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady, especially as
Steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when I referred to her, and posi-
tively refused to answer any question of which I made her the subject. I
remained, therefore, in a state of considerable expectation until the cloth
had been removed some half an hour, and we were sitting over our
decanter of wine before the fire, when the door opened, and Littimer, with
 his habitual serenity quite undisturbed, announced :
   !' Miss Mowcher ! "
    I looked at the doorway and saw nothing. I was still looking at the
doorway, thinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her
appearance, when, to my infinite astonishment, there came waddling round
a sofa which stood between me and it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty or
forty-five, with a very large head and face, a pair of roguish grey eyes,
and such extremely little arms, that, to enable herself to lay a finger archly
against her snub nose, as she ogled Steerforth, she was obliged to meet
the finger half-way, and lay her nose against it. Her chin, which was
what is called a double-chin, was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the
strings of her bonnet, bow and all. Throat she had none; waist she had
none ; legs she had none, worth mentioning; for though she was more
than full-sized down to where her waist would have been, if she had had
any, and though she terminated, as human beings generally do, in a pair
of feet, she was so short that she stood at a common-sized chair as at a
table, resting a bag she carried on the seat. This lady ; dressed in an
off-hand, easy style ; bringing her nose and her forefinger together, with
the difficulty I have described ; standing with her head necessarily on one
side, and, with one of her sharp eyes shut up, making an uncommonly
knowing face; after ogling Steerforth for a few moments, broke into a
torrent of words.
    " What ! My flower ! " she pleasantly began, shaking her large head
at him. "You 're there, are you ! Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame,
what do you do so far away from home? Up to mischief, I'll be bound.
Oh, you 're a downy fellow, Steerforth, so you are, and I ' m another, ain't
I ? Ha, ha, ha ! You 'd have betted a hundred pound to five, now, that
you wouldn't have seen me here, wouldn't you? Bless you, man alive,
I 'm everywhere. I 'm here and there, and where not, like the conjuror's
half-crown in the lady's handkercher. Talking of hankerchers-and
talking of ladies-what a comfort you are to your blessed mother, ain't
you, my dear boy, over one of my shoulders, and I don't say which I "
    Miss Mowcher untied her bonnet, at this passage of her discourse, threw
back the strings, and sat down, panting, on a footstool in front of the fire
-making a kind of arbor of the dining-table, which spread its mahogany
shelter above her head.
    " Oh my stars and what's-their-names ! " she went on, clapping a hand

on each of her little knees, and glancing shrewdly at me, " I 'm of too
full a habit, that's the fact, Steerforth. After a flight of stairs, it gives
me as much trouble to draw every breath I want, as if it was a bucket of
 water. If you saw me looking out of an upper window, you'd think I
 was a fine woman, wouldn't you ?"
    "I should think that, wherever I saw you," replied Steerforth.
    " Go along, you dog, do !" cried the little creature, making a whisk at
 him with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face, "and don't
232            TEE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

be impudent ! But I give you my word and honor I was at Lady Mithers's
last week-there's      a woman! How she wears !-and Mithers himself
came into the room where I was waiting for her-tke 's a man ! How
Ae wears ! and his wig too, for he's had it these ten years-and he went
on at that rate in the complimentary line, that I began to think I should
be obliged to ring the bell. H a ! ha ! ha ! He 's a pleasant wretch, but
he wants principle."
    " What were you doing for Lady Mithers ?"       asked Steerforth.
    " That's tellings, my blessed infant," she retorted, tapping her nose

again, screwing up her face, and twinkling her eyes like an imp of super-
natural intelligence. " Never you mind ! You 'd like to know whether I
stop her hair from falling off, or dye it, or touch up her complexion, or
improve her eyebrows, wouldn't you? And so you shall, my darling-
when I tell you ! Do you know what my great grandfather's name was ? "
    " No,'' said Steerforth.
    " I t was Walker, my sweet pet," replied Miss Mowcher, "and he
came of a long line of Walkers, that I inherit all the Hookey estates from."
    I never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher's wink, except
Miss Mowcher's self-possession. She had a wonderful way too, when
listening to what was said to her, or when waiting for an answer to what
she had said herself, of pausing with her head cunningly on one side, and
one eye turned up like a magpie's. Altogether I was lost in amazement,
and sat staring at her, quite oblivious, I am afraid, of the laws of politeness.
    She had by this time drawn the chair to her side, and was busily
engaged in producing from the bag (plunging in her short arm to the
shoulder, at every dive) a number of small bottles, sponges, combs, brushes,
bits of flannel, little pairs of curling irons, and other instruments, which
she tumbled in a heap upon the chair. From this employment she
suddenly desisted, and said to Steerforth, much to my confusion :
    " Who 's your friend ? "
    " Mr. Copperfield," said Steerforth ; " he wants to know you."
    " Well, then, he shall ! I thought he looked as if he did !" returned
Miss Mowcher, waddling up to me, bag in hand, and laughing on me
as she came. "Face like a peach!" standing on tiptoe to pinch my
cheek as I sat. " Quite tempting ! I 'm very fond of peaches. Happy
to make your acquaintance, Mr. Copperfield, I 'm sure.''
    I said that I congratulated myself on having the honor to make hers,
and that the happiness was mutual.
    " O h my goodness, how polite we are !" exclaimed Miss Mowcher,
making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of
 a hand. " What a world of gammon and spinnage it is, though, ain't it !"
    This was addressed confidentially to both of us, as the morsel of a hand
 came away from the face, and buried itself, arm and all, in the bag again.
    " What do you mean, Miss Mowcher ?"        said Steerforth.
    " H a ! ha ! ha ! What a refreshing set of humbugs we are, to be sure,

 ain't we, my sweet child?" replied that morsel of a woman, feeling in
the bag with her head on one side, and her eye in the air. "Look
 here !" taking something out. "Scraps of the Russian Prince's nails!
 Prince Alphabet turned topsy-turvy, I call him, for his name's got all the
 letters in it, higgledy-piggledy."
    " The Russian Prince is a client of yours, is he ? " said Steerforth.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            1133
   "I believe you, my pet," replied Miss Mowcher. "I keep his nails in
order for him. Twice a week ! Fingers and toes !"
   "He pays well, I hope ? " said Steerforth.
   "Pays as he speaks, my dear child-through the nose," replied Miss
Mowcher. "None of your close shavers the Prince ain't. You 'd say so,
if you saw his moustachios. Red by nature, black by art."
   "By your art, of course," said Steerforth.
   Miss Mowcher winked assent. " Forced to send for me. Couldn't
help it. The climate affected his dye ; it did very well in Russia, but it
was no go here. You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born
days as he was. Like old iron ! "
   " I s that why you called him a humbug, just now? " inquired Steerforth.
   " Oh, you're a broth of a boy, ain't you?" returned Miss Mowcher,
shaking her head violently. " I said, what a set of humbugs we were in
general, and I showed you the scraps of the Prince's nails to prove it. The
Prince's nails do more for me, in private families of the genteel sort, than
all my talents put together. I always carry 'em about. They 're the best
introduction. If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince's nails, she must be all
right. I give 'em away to the young ladies. They put 'em in albums,
I believe. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Upon my life, 'the whole social system ' (as the
men call it when they make speeches in Parliament) is a system of Prince's
nails!" said this least of women, trying to fold her short arms, and
nodding her large head.
   Steerforth laughed heartily, and I laughed too. Miss Mowcher con-
tinuing all the time to shake her head (which was very much on one side),
and to look into the air with one eye, and to wink with the other.
   " Well, well ! " she said, smiting her small knees, and rising, " this is not

business. Come, Steerforth,let 's explore the polar regions, and have it over."
   She then selected two or three of the little instruments, and a little
bottle, and asked (to my surprise) if the table would bear. On Steerforth's
replying in the affirmative, she pushed a chair against it, and begging the
assistance of my hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, to the top, as if it
were a stage.
    "If either of you saw my ankles," she said, when she was safely
elevated, " say so, and 1'11 go home and destroy myself."
    " 1did not," said Steerforth.

    " I did not," said I.
    " Well then," cried Miss Mowcher, "1'11 consent to live.     Now, ducky,
 ducky, ducky, come to Mrs. Bond and be killed ! "
    This was an invocation to Steerforth to place himself under her hands ;
 who, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table, and his
laughing face towards me, and submitted his head to her inspection,
 evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment. To see Miss
 Mowcher standing over him, looking at his rich profusion of brown hair
 through a large round magnifying glass, which she took out of her pocket,
 was a most amazing spectacle.
    " You 're a pretty fellow ! " said Miss Mowcher, after a brief inspection.
 "You'd be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months,
 but for me. Just half-a-minute, my young friend, and we'll give you a
 polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years ! "
    With this, she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one
$2 34         THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

of the little bits of flannel, and, again imparting some of the virtues of that
preparation to one of the little brushes, began rubbing and scraping away
with both on the crown of Steerforth's head in the busiest manner I ever
witnessed, talking all the time.
   "There 's Charley Pyegrave, the duke's son," she said. "You know
Charley ? " peeping round into his face.
   " A little," said Steerforth.

   "What a man he is ! There 's a whisker ! As to Charley's legs, if they
were only a pair (which they ain't), they 'd defy competition. Would you
believe he tried to do without me-in the Life-Guards, too? "
   " Mad ! " said Steerforth.
   " I t looks like it. However, mad or sane, he tried," returned Miss
Mowcher. "What does he do, but, lo and behold you, he goes into a
perfumer's shop, and wants to buy a bottle of the Madagascar Liquid.
   " Charley does ? " said Steerforth.

   "Charley does. But they haven't got any of the Madagascar Liquid."
   " What is i t ?    Something to drink? " asked Steerforth.
   " To drink?" returned Miss Mowcher, stopping to slap his cheek. "To
doctor his own moustachios with, you know. There was a woman in the
shop-elderly female-quite a Griffin-who had never even heard of it by
name. 'Begging pardon, sir,' said the Griffin to Charley, ' i t 's not-
not-not ROUGE, is it ? ' ' Rouge,' said Charley to the Griffin. ' What
the unmentionable to ears polite, do you think I want with rouge ? ' ' No
offence, sir,' said the Griffin; 'we have it asked for by so many names, I
thought it might be.' Now that, my child," continued Miss Mowcher,
rubbing all the time as busily as ever, "is another instance of the
refreshing humbug I was speaking of. I do something in that way
myself-perhaps a good deal-perhaps a little-sharp 's the word, my
dear boy-never mind ! "
   " I n what way do you mean? I n the rouge way? " said Steerforth.
   "Put this and that together, my tender pupil," returned the wary
Mowcher, touching her nose, "work it by the rule of Secrets in all trades,
and the product will give you the desired result. I say I do a little
in that way myself. One Dowager, she calls it lip-salve. Another, she
calls it gloves. Another, she calls it tucker-edging. Another, she calls
it a fan. I call it whatever they call it. I supply it for 'em, but we
keep up the trick so, to one another, and make believe with such a face,
that they 'd as soon think of laying it on, before a whole drawing-room, as
before me. And when I wait upon 'em, they 1         ' 1 say to me sometimes-
with i t on-thick, and no mistake-' How am I looking, Mowcher? Am
I pale ? ' H a ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Isn't that refreshing, my young friend ! "
   I never did in my days behold anything like Mowcher as she stood upon
the dining-table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at
Steerforth's head, and winking at me over it.
   "Ah ! " she said. " Such things are not much in demand hereabouts.
That sets me off again ! I havn't seen a pretty woman since I 've been
here, Jemmy."
   "No ? " said Steerforth.
   "Not the ghost of one," replied Miss Mowcher.
   " We could show her the substance of one, I think ? " said S.teerforth,
addressing his eyes to mine. "Eh, Daisy ? "
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

  " Yes, indeed," said I.
  " Aha ? " cried the little creature, glancing sharply at my face, and then
peeping round at Steerforth's. " Umph ? "
    The first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us, and
 the second like a question put to Steerforth only. She seemed to have
 found no answer to either, but continued to rub, with her head on one
 side and her eye turned up, as if she were looking for an answer in the air,
 and were confident of its appearing presently.
    "A sister of yours, Mr. Copperfield ? " she cried, after a pause, and still
 keeping the same look out. "Aye, aye?"
    "No," said Steerforth, before I could reply. "Nothing of the sort.
 On the contrary, Mr. Copperfield used-or I am much mistaken-to have
 a great admiration for her."
    " Why, hasn't he now?" returned Miss Mowcher. " I s he fickle? oh,
for shame ! Did he sip every flower, and change every hour, until Polly
his passion requited?-Is her name Polly ? "
    The Elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this
 question, and a searching look, quite disconcerted me for a moment.
    " No, Miss Mowcher," I replied.        "Her name is Emily."
    " Aha ? " she cried exactly as before. " Umph ? What a rattle I am !
Mr. Copperfield, ain't I volatile ? "
    Her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in
connexion with the subject. So I said, in a graver manner than any of us
had yet assumed :
    " She is as virtuous as she is pretty.  She is engaged to be married to a
most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life. I esteem her
for her good sense, as much as I admire her for her good looks."
    "Well said ! " cried Steerforth. " Hear, hear, hear ! Now, I '11 quench
the curiosity of this little Fatima, my dear Daisy, by leaving her nothing to
guess at. She is at present apprenticed, Miss Mowcher, or articled, or what-
ever it may be, to Omer and Joram, Haberdashers, Milliners, and so forth,
in this town. Do you observe? Omer and Joram. The promise of
which my friend has spoken, is made and entered into with her cousin;
Christian name, Ham ; surname, Peggotty ; occupation, boat-builder ;also
of this town. She lives with a relative ; Christian name, unknown ; sur-
name, Peggotty; occupation, seafaring; also of this town. She is the
prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world. I admire her-as
my friend does-exceedingly.        If it were not that I might appear to dis-
parage her Intended, which I know my friend would not like, I would
add, that to me she seems to be throwing herself away; that I am sure
she might do better; and that I swear she was born to be a lady."
   Miss Mowcher listened to these words, which were very slowly and
distinctly spoken, with her head on one side, and her eye in the air as if
she were still looking for that answer. When he ceased, she became brisk
again in an instant, and rattled away with surprising volubility.
    "Oh! And that's all about it, is i t ? " she exclaimed, trimming his
whiskers with a little restless pair of scissors, that went glancing round
his head in all directions. "Very well : very well ! Quite a long story.
Ought to end, 'and they lived happy ever afterwards ;' oughtn't it ? Ah !
What's that game at forfeits? I love my love with an E, because she's
enticing ; I hate her with an E, because she 's engaged. I took her to the
236            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 sign of the exquisite, and treated her with an elopement, her name's Emily,
 and she lives in the east ? Ha ! ha ! ha ! Mr. Copperfield, ain't I volatile ? "
    Merely looking at me with extravagant slyness, and not waiting for any
reply, she continued, without drawing breath :
    "There ! If ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to
perfection, you are, Steerforth. If I understand any noddle in the world,
I understand yours. Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling ?
I understand yours," peeping down into his face. " Now you may mizzle,
Jemmy (as we say at Court), and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair
I '11 operate on him."
    " What do you say, Daisy ?" inquired Steerforth, laughing, and resigning
his seat. "Will you be improved?"
    "Thank you, Miss Mowcher, not this evening."
    "Don't say no," returned the little woman, looking at me with the
aspect of a connoisseur ; " a little bit more eyebrow ?"
    "Thank you," I returned, " some other time."
    "Have it carried half a quarter of an inch towards the temple," said
Miss Mowcher. " We can do it in a fortnight."
    " No, I thank you.     Not at present."
    " Go in for a tip," she urged. " No ? Let's get the scaffolding up,
then, for a pair of whiskers. Come ! "
    I could not help blushing as I declined, for I felt we were on my weak
point, now. But Miss Mowcher, finding that I was not at present disposed
for any decoration within the range of her art, and that I was, for the time
being, proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held
up before one eye to enforce her persuasions, said we would make a begin-
ning on an early day, and requested the aid of my hand to descend from
her elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped down with much agility,
and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet.
    " The fee," said Steerforth, " is -"
    " Five bob," replied Miss Mowcher, " and dirt-cheap, my chicken.
Ain't I volatile, Mr. Copperfield? "
    I replied politely : " Not at all." But I thought she was rather so, when
she tossed up his two half-crowns like a goblin pieman, caught them,
dropped them in her pocket, and gave it a loud slap.
    " That 's the Till !" observed Miss Mowcher, standing at the chair again,
and replacing in the bag the miscellaneous collection of little objects she
had emptied out of it. " Have I got all my traps? I t seems so. I t
won't do to be like long Ned Beadwood, when they took him to church 'to
marry him to somebody,' as he says, and left the bride behind. Ha ! ha ! ha !
A wicked rascal, Ned, but droll! Now, I know I ' m going to break
your hearts, but I am forced to leave you. You must call up all your
fortitude, and try to bear it. Good bye, Mr. Copperfield ! Take care of
yourself, Jockey of Norfolk ! How I have been rattling on ! It's all the
fault of you two wretches. Iforgive you ! ' Bob swore ! '-as the English-
man said for ' Good night,' when he first learnt French, and thought it so
like English. ' Bob swore,' my ducks ! "
    With the bag slung over her arm, and rattling as she waddled away,
she waddled to the door ; where she stopped to inquire if she should leave
us a lock of her hair. " Ain't I volatile? " she added, as a commentary on
this offer, and, with her finger on her nose, departed.

   Steerforth laughed to that degree, that it was impossible for me to help
laughing too; though I am not sure I should have done so, but for
this inducement. When we had had our laugh quite out, which was after
some time, he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive con-
nexion, and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways.
Some people trifled with her as a mere oddity, he said; but she was as
shrewdly and sharply observant as any one he knew, and as long-headed
as she was short-armed. He told me that what she had said of being here,
and there, and everywhere, was true enough; for she made little darts into
the provinces, and seemed to pick up customers everywhere, and to
know everybody. I asked him what her disposition was : whether it was
at all mischievous, and if her sympathies were generally on the right side
of things : but, not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions
after two or three attempts, I forbore or forgot to repeat them. He told
me instead, with much rapidity, a good deal about her skill, and her
profits; and about her being a scientific cupper, if I should ever have
occasion for her services in that capacity.
   She was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening :
and when we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the
bannisters, " Bob swore ! " as I went down stairs.
   I was surprised, when I came to Mr. Barkis's house to find Ham
walking up and down in front of it, and still more surprised to learn from
him that little Em'ly was inside. I naturally inquired why he was not
there too, instead of pacing the street by himself?
   " Why, you see, Mas'r Davy," he rejoined, in a hesitating manner,
"Em'ly, she's talking to some 'un in here."
   " I should have thought," said I, smiling, "that that was a reason for

your being in here too, Ham."
   " Well, Mas'r Davy, in a general way, so 't would be," he returned ;
"but look'ee here, Mas'r Davy," lowering his voice, and speaking very
gravely. " It's a young woman, sir-a young woman, that Em'ly knowed
once, and doen't ought to know no more."
   When I heard these words, a light began to fall upon the figure I had
seen following them, some hours ago.
   " I t 'S a poor wurem, MasJr Davy," said Ham, " as is trod under foot
by all the town. U p street and down street. The mowld o' the church-
yard don't hold any that the folk shrink away from, more."
   " Did I see her to-night, Ham, on the sands, after we met you ? "
   " Keeping us in sight? " said Ham. " I t 's like you did, Mas'r Davy.
" Not that I know'd, then, she was theer, sir, but along of her creeping
soon arterwards under Em'ly's little winder, when she see the light come,
and whisp'ring 'Em'ly, Em'ly, for Christ's sake have a woman's heart
towards me. I was once like you! ' Those was solemn words, Mas'r
Davy, fur to hear ! "
   " They were indeed, Ham. What did Em'ly do ? "
   " Says Em'ly, ' Martha, is it you? Oh, Martha, can it be you! '-for
they had sat at work together, many a day, at Mr. Omer's."
   " I recollect her now! " cried I, recalling one of the two girls I had
seen when I first went there. " I recollect her quite well ! "
   " Martha Endell," said Ham. " Two or three year older than Em'ly,
but was at the school with her."
238           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  " I never heard her name," said I. "I didn't mean to interrupt you."
    " For the matter o' that, Mas'r Davy," replied Ham, " all's told a'most

in them words, ' Em'ly, Em'ly, for Christ's sake have a woman's heart
towards me. I was once like you! ' She wanted to speak to Em'ly.
Em'ly couldn't speak to her theer, for her loving uncle was come home,
and he wouldn't-no, Mas'r Davy," said Ham, with great earnestness,
"he couldn't, kind-naturd, tender-hearted as he is, see them two toge-
ther, side by side, for all the treasures that's wrecked in the sea."
    I felt how true this was. I knew it, on the instant, quite as well as
Ham.
    " SO Em'ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper," he pursued, " and gives

it to her out o' winder to bring here. 'Show that,' she says, ' to my aunt,
Mrs. Barkis, and she'll set you down by her fire, for the love of me, till
uncle is gone out, and I can come.' By-and-by she tells me what I tell you,
Mas'r Davy, and asks me to bring her. What can I do ? She doen't ought
to know any such, but I can't deny her, when the tears is on her face."
    H e put his hand into the breast of his shaggy jacket, and took out with
great care a pretty little purse.
    " And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face, Mas'r Davy,"
said Ham, tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand, "how
could I deny her when she give me this to carry for her-knowing what
she brought it for? Such a toy as it is ! " said Ham, thoughtfully
looking on it. "With such alittle money in it, Em'ly my dear ! "
    I shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away again-for
that was more satisfactory to me than saying anything-and we walked up
and down, for a minute or two, in silence. The door opened then, and
Peggotty appeared, beckoning to Ham to come in. I would have kept
away, but she came after me, entreating me to come in too. Even then,
I would have avoided the room where they all were, but for its being the
neat-tiled kitchen I have mentioned more than once. The door opening
immediately into it, I found myself among them, before I considered
whither I was going.
    The girl-the same I had seen upon the sands-was near the fire. She
was sitting on the ground, with her head and one arm lying on a chair.
I fancied, from the disposition of her figure, that Em'ly had but newly risen
from the chair, and that the forlorn head might perhaps have been lying on
her lap. I saw but little of the girl's face, over which her hair fell loose
and scattered, as if she had been disordering it with her own hands ; but
I saw that she was young, and of a fair complexion. Peggotty had been
crying. So had little Em'ly. Not a word was spoken when we first went
i n ; and the Dutch clock by the dresser seemed, in the silence, to tick
twice as loud as usual.
    Em'ly spoke first.
    " Martha wants," she said to Ham, " t o go to London."
    "Why to London?" returned Ham.
    H e stood between them, looking on the prostrate girl with a mixture of
compassion for her, and of jealousy of her holding any companionship with
her whom he loved so well, which I have always remembered distinctly.
They both spoke as if she were ill; in a soft, suppressed tone that was
plainly heard, although it hardly rose above a whisper.
    " Better there than here," said a third voice aloud-Martha's, though
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

she did not move. " No one knows me there. Everybody knows me
here."
   " What will she do there?" inquired Ham.
   She lifted up her head, and looked darkly round at him for a moment ;
then laid it down again, and curved her right arm about her neck, as a
woman in a fever, or in an agony of pain from a shot, might twist herself.
   "She will try to do well," said little Em'ly. " You don't know what
she has said to us. Does he-do they-aunt? "
   Peggotty shook her head compassionately.
   " I'll try," said Martha, "if you 1' 1 help me away. I never can do
worse than I have done here. I may do better. Oh ! " with a dreadful
shiver, " take me out of these streets, where the whole town knows me
from a child ! "
   As Em'ly held out her hand to Ham, I saw him put in it a little
canvas bag. She took it, as if she thought it were her purse, and made
a step or two forward; but finding her mistake, came back to where he
had retired near me, and showed it to him.
   " It 's all yourn, Em'ly," I could hear him say. "I haven't nowt in
all the wureld that ain't yourn, my dear. It ain't of no delight to me,
except for you ! "
   The tears rose freshly in her eyes, but she turned away, and went to
Martha. What she gave her, I don't know. I saw her stooping over her,
and putting money in her bosom. She whispered something, and asked
was that enough? " More than enough," the other said, and took her
hand and kissed it.
   Then Martha arose, and gathering her shawl about her, covering her
face with it, and weeping aloud, went slowly to the door. She stopped a
moment before going out, as if she would have uttered something or
turned back ; but no word passed her lips. Making the same low, dreary,
wretched moaning in her shawl, she went away.
   As the door closed, little Em'ly looked at us three in a hurried
manner, and then hid her face in her hands, and fell to sobbing.
   " Doen't, Em'ly ! " said Ham, tapping her gently on the shoulder.
" Doen't, my dear ! You doen't ought to cry so, pretty ! "
   " Oh, Ham !" she exclaimed, still weeping pitifully, " I am not as
good a girl as I ought to be! I know I have not the thankful heart,
sometimes, I ought to have ! "
   "Yes, yes, you have, I 'm sure," said Ham.
   " No ! no ! no ! " cried little Em'ly, sobbing, and shaking her head.
"I am not as good a girl as I ought to be. Not near ! not near ! "
   And still she cried, as if her heart would break.
   "I try your love too much. I know I do ! " she sobbed. " I ' m often
cross to you, and changeable with you, when I ought to be far different.
You are never so to me. Why am I ever so to you, when I should think
of nothing but how to be grateful, and to make you happy !"
   "You always make me so," said Ham, "my dear! I am happy in
the sight of you. I am happy, all day long, in the thoughts of you."
   " Ah ! that 's not enough !" she cried. " That is because you are good ;
not because I am ! Oh, my dear, it might have been a better fortune for
you, if you had been fond of some one else-of some one steadier and
240           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

much worthier than me, who was all bound up in you, and never vain
and changeable like me ! "
   " Poor little tender-heart," said Ham, in a low voice. " Martha has
overset her, altogether."
   " Please, aunt," sobbed Em'ly, " come here, and let me lay my head

upon you. Oh, I am very miserable to-night, aunt ! Oh, I am not as
good a girl as I ought to be. I am not, I know ! "
   Peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire. Em'ly, with her
arms around her neck, kneeled by her, looking up most earnestly into her
face.
   " Oh, pray, aunt, try to help me !    Ham, dear, try to help me ! Mr.
David, for the sake of old times, do, please, try to help me ! I want to be
a better girl than I am. I want to feel a hundred times more thankful
than I do. I want to feel more, what a blessed thing it is to be the wife
of a good man, and to lead a peaceful life. Oh me, oh me ! Oh, my
heart, my heart ! "
   She dropped her face on my old nurse's breast, and, ceasing this suppli-
cation, which in its agony and grief was half a woman's, half a child's, as
all her manner was (being, in that, more natural, and better suited to her
beauty, as I thought, than any other manner could have been), wept
silently, while my old nurse hushed her like an infant.
    She got calmer by degrees, and then we soothed her; now talking
encouragingly, and now jesting a little with her, until she began to raise
her head and speak to us. So we got on, until she was able to smile, and
then to laugh, and then to sit up, half ashamed ; while Peggotty recalled
her stray ringlets, dried her eyes, and made her neat again, lest her uncle
should wonder, when she got home, why his darling had been crying.
   I saw her do, that night, what I had never seen her do before. I saw
her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek, and creep close to
his bluff form as if it were her best support. When they went away
together, in the waning moonlight, and I looked after them, comparing
their departure in my mind with Martha's, I saw that she held his arm
with both her hands, and still kept close to him.




                         CHAPTER XXIII.
       I CORROBORATE MR. DICK, AND CHOOSE A PROFESSION.

   WHENI awoke in the morning I thought very much of little Em'ly,
and her emotion last night, after Martha had left. I felt as if I
had come into the knowledge of those domestic weaknesses and tender-
nesses in a sacred confidence, and that to disclose them, even to Steer-
forth, would be wrong. I had no gentler feeling towards any one than
towards the pretty creature who had been my playmate, and whom I have
always been persuaded, and shall always be persuaded, to my dying day,
I then devotedly loved. The repetition to any ears-even to Steerforth's
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         241
 -of what she had been unable to repress when her heart lay open to me
 by an accident, I felt would be a rough deed, unworthy of myself, unworthy
 of the light of our pure childhood, which I always saw encircling her
 head. I made a resolution, therefore, to keep it in my own breast; and
 there it gave her image a new grace.
    While we were at breakfast, a letter was delivered to me from my aunt.
 As it contained matter on which I thought Steerforth could advise me as
 well as any one, and on which I knew I should be delighted to consult
 him, I resolved to make it a subject of discussion on our journey home.
 For the present we had enough to do, in taking leave of all our friends.
 Mr. Barkis was far from being the last among them, in his regret at our
 departure; and I believe would even have opened the box again, and
 sacrificed another guinea, if it would have kept us eight-and-forty hours
in Yarmouth. Peggotty, and all her family, were full of grief at our
going. The whole house of Omer and Joram turned out to bid us good
bye; and there were so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on
Steerforth, when our portmanteaus went to the coach, that if we had had
the baggage of a regiment with us, we should hardly have wanted porters
to carry it. I n a word, we departed to the regret and admiration of all
concerned, and left a great many people very sorry behind us.
    "Do you stay long here, Littimer ?" said I, as he stood waiting to see
the coach start.
    " No, sir," he replied ; 'I probably not very long, sir."
    " He can hardly say just now," observed Steerforth, carelessly. " H e
knows what he has to do, and he 1' 1 do it."
    "That I am sure he will," said I.
    Littimer touched his hat in acknowledgment of my good opinion, and
Ifelt about eight years old. He touched it once more, wishing us a good
journey; and we left him standing on the pavement, as respectable a mystery
as any pyramid in Egypt.
    For some little time we held no conversation, Steerforth being unusually
silent, and I being sufficiently engaged in wondering, within myself, when
I should see the old places again, and what new changes might happen to
me or them in the meanwhile. At length Steerforth, becoming gay and
talkative in a moment, as he could become anything he liked at any
moment, pulled me by the arm :
    "Find a voice, David. What about the letter you were speaking of at
breakfast ?"
    " Oh ! " said I , taking it out of my pocket. " It's from my aunt.''

    " And what does she say, requiring consideration ! "
    "Why, she reminds me, Steerforth," said I, "that I came out on this
expedition to look about me, and to think a little."
    " Which, of course, you have done? "
    " Indeed I can't say I have, particularly. To tell you the truth, I am
afraid I had forgotten it."
    " Well ! look about you now, and make up for your negligence," said
Steerforth. "Look to the right, and you'll see a flat country, with a
good deal of marsh in it ; look to the left, and you 1' 1 see the same. Look
to the front, and you '11 find no difference; look to the rear, and there it
is still."
                                                               R
242           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   I laughed, and replied that I saw no suitable profession in the whole
prospect; which was perhaps to be attributed to its flatness.
   "What says our aunt on the subject?" inquired Steerforth, glancing
at the letter in my hand. "Does she suggest anything? "
   " Why, yes," said I.     "She asks me, here, if I think I should like to be
a proctor ? What do you think of it ? "
   " Well, I don't know," replied Steerforth, coolly.    " You may as well
do that as anything else, I suppose."
   I could not help laughing again, at his balancing all callings and profes-
sions so equally ; and I told him so.
   " What is a proctor, Steerforth ? " said I.
   "Why, he is a sort of monkish attorney," replied Steerforth. " He is,
to some faded courts held in Doctors' Commons-a lazy old nook near St.
Paul's Churchyard-what solicitors are to the courts of law and equity.
He is a functionary whose existence, in the natural course of things, would
have terminated about two hundred years ago. I can tell you best what
he is, by telling you what Doctors' Commons is. It's a little out-of-the-
way place, where they administer what is called ecclesiastical law, and
play all kinds of tricks with obsolete old monsters of acts of Parlia-
ment, which three-fourths of the world know nothing about, and the other
fourth supposes to have been dug up, in a fossil state, in the days of the
Edwards. It's a place that has an ancient monopoly in suits about people's
wills and people's marriages, and disputes among ships and boats."
   " Nonsense, Steerforth ! " I exclaimed.     " You don't mean to say that

there is any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters? "
   " I don't, indeed, my dear boy," he returned; "but I mean to say that

they are managed and decided by the same set of people, down in that
same Doctors' Commons. You shall go there one day, and find them
blundering through half the nautical terms in Young's Dictionary, apropos
of the 'Nancy ' havingrun down the ' Sarah Jane,' or Mr. Peggotty and the
Yarmouth boatmen having put off in a gale of wind with an anchor and
cable to the 'Nelson ' Indiaman in distress ;and you shall go there another
day, and find them deep in the evidence, pro and con, respecting a clergy-
man who has misbehaved himself; and you shall find the judge in the
nautical case, the advocate in the clergyman case, or contrariwise. They
are like actors : now a man's a judge, and now he is not a judge ; now he 's
one thing, now he's another ; now he 's something else, change and change
about; but it's always a very pleasant profitable little affair of private
theatricals, presented to an uncommonly select audience."
    "But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?" said I, a
little puzzled. " Are they ? "
    " No,"   returned Steerforth, "the advocates are civilians-men who
 have taken a doctor's degree at college-which is the first reason of my
 knowing anything about it. The proctors employ the advocates. Both
 get very comfortable fees, and altogether they make a mighty snug little
party. On the whole, I would recommend you to take to Doctors'
 Commons kindly, David. They plume themselves on their gentility there,
 I can tell you, if that's any satisfaction."
    I made allowance for Steerforth's light way of treating the subject,
 and, considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and antiquity
 which I associated with that " lazy old nook near St. Paul's Churchyard,"
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           243
did not feel indisposed towards my aunt's suggestion; which she left to
my free decision, making no scruple of telling me that it had occurred
to her, on her lately visiting her own proctor in Doctors' Commons
for the purpose of settling her will in my favor.
   " That's a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt, at all events,"
said Steerforth, when I mentioned it ; " and one deserving of all encourage-
ment, Daisy, my advice is that you take kindly to Doctors' Commons."
   I quite made up my mind to do so. I then told Steerforth that my
aunt was in town awaiting me (as I found from her letter), and that she
had taken lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, where there was a stone staircase, and a convenient door in the
roof; my aunt being firmly persuaded that every house in London was
going to be burnt down every night.
   We achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to
Doctors' Commons, and anticipating the distant days when I should be a
proctor there, which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and
whimsical lights, that made us both merry. When we came to our journey's
end, he went home, engaging to call upon me next day but one; and I
drove to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where I found my aunt up, and waiting
supper.
   If I had been round the world since we parted, we could hardly have
been better pleased to meet again. My aunt cried outright as she em-
braced me ; and said, pretending to laugh, that if my poor mother had been
alive, that silly little creature would have shed tears, she had no doubt.
    " So you have left Mr. Dick behind, aunt ? " said I.      " I am sorry for

that. Ah, Janet, how do you do ?"
   As Janet curtsied, hoping I was well, I observed my aunt's visage
lengthen very much.
    " I am sorry for it, too," said my aunt, rubbing her nose. "I have
had no peace of mind, Trot, since I have been here."
   Before I could ask why, she told me.
   " I am convinced," said my aunt ; laying her hand with melancholy

firmness on the table, " that Dick's character is not a character to keep
the donkies off. I am confident he wants strength of purpose. I ought
to have left Janet at home, instead, and then my mind might perhaps
have been at ease. If ever there was a donkey trespassing on my green,"
said my aunt, with emphasis, "there was one this afternoon at four o'clock.
A cold feeling came over me from head to foot, and I know it was a
donkey !"
   I tried to comfort her on this point, but she rejected consolation.
    " I t was a donkey," said my aunt; "and it was the one with the
stumpy tail which that Murdering sister of a woman rode, when she came
to my house.'' This had been, ever since, the only name my aunt knew
for Miss Murdstone. "If there is any donkey in Dover, whose audacity
it is harder to me to bear than another's, that," said my aunt, striking the
table, "is the animal ! "
   Janet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself
unnecessarily, and that she believed the donkey in question was then
engaged in the sand and gravel line of business, and was not available for
purposes of trespass. But my aunt wouldn't hear of it.
                                                                P2
244           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    Supper was comfortably served and hot, though my aunt's rooms were
very high up-whether that she might have more stone stairs for her money,
or might be nearer to the door in the roof, I don't know-and consisted
of a roast fowl, a steak, and some vegetables, to all of which I did ample
justice, and which were all excellent. But my aunt had her own ideas
concerning London provision, and ate but little.
    "I suppose this unfortunate fowl was born and brought up in a cellar,"
said my aunt, "and never took the air except on a hackney coach-stand.
I hope the steak may be beef, but I don't believe it. Nothing's genuine
in the place, in my opinion, but the dirt."
    "Don't you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt ? "
 I hinted.
    " Certainly not," returned my aunt.     " I t would be no pleasure to a
 London tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it
was."
   I did not venture to controvert this opinion, but I made a good supper,
which it greatly satisfied her to see me do. When the table was cleared,
Janet assisted her to arrange her hair, to put on her nightcap, which was
of a smarter construction than usual ("in case of fire," my aunt said), and
to fold her gown back over her knees, these being her usual preparations
for warming herself before going to bed. I then made her, according to
certain established regulations from which no deviation, however slight,
could ever be permitted, a glass of hot white wine and water, and a slice
of toast cut into long thin strips. With these accompaniments we were
left alone to finish the evening, my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking
her wine and water; soaking her strips of toast in it, one by one, before
eating them; and looking benignantly on me, from among the borders of
her nightcap.
    " Well, Trot," she began, " what do you think of the proctor plan ?
Or have you not begun to think about it yet ? "
    " I have thought a good deal about it, my dear aunt, and I have talked
a good deal about it with Steerforth. I like it very much indeed. I like
it exceedingly."
    " Come ! " said my aunt.    " That 's cheering !"

    "I have only one difficulty, aunt."
    "Say what it is, Trot," she returned.
    "Why, I want to ask, aunt, as this seems, from what I understand, to
be a limited profession, whether my entrance into it would not be very
expensive ? "
    " I t will cost," returned my aunt, "to article you, just a thousand
pounds."
    " Now, my dear aunt," said I, drawing my chair nearer, "I am uneasy
in my mind about that. It's a large sum of money. You have expended
a great deal on my education, and have always been as liberal to me in all
things, as it was possible to be. You have been the soul of generosity.
 Surely there are some ways in which I might begin life with hardly any
outlay, and yet begin with a good hope of getting on by resolution and
exertion. Are you sure that it would not be better to try that course?
Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money, and
that it is right it should be so expended? I only ask you, my second
mother, to consider. Are you certain?"
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            245
    My aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then
 engaged, looking me full in the face all the while; and then setting her
 glass on the chimney-piece, and folding her hands upon her folded skirts,
 replied as follows :
     " Trot, my child, if I have any object in life, it is to provide for your
 being a good, a sensible, and a happy man. I am bent upon it-so is
 Dick. I should like some people that I know to hear Dick's conver-
 sation on the subject. Its sagacity is wonderful. But no one knows the
 resources of that man's intellect, except myself! "
     She stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers, and went on :
     " It's in vain, Trot, to recall the past, unless it works some influence
 upon the present. Perhaps I might have been better friends with your
 poor father. Perhaps I might have been better friends with that poor
 child your mother, even after your sister Betsey Trotwood disappointed
 me. When you came to me, a little runaway boy, all dusty and way-
worn, perhaps I thought so. From that time until now, Trot, you have
ever been a credit to me and a pride and pleasure. I have no other claim
upon my means ; at least " -here to my surprise she hesitated, and
was confused-" no, I have no other claim upon my means-and you are
my adopted child. Only be a loving child to me in my age, and bear
with my whims and fancies ; and you will do more for an old woman
whose prime of life was not so happy or conciliating as it might have
been, than ever that old woman did for you."
    I t was the first time I had heard my aunt refer to her past history.
There was a magnanimity in her quiet way of doing so, and of dismissing
it, which would have exalted her in my respect and affection, if any thing
could.
    " All is agreed and understood between us now, Trot," said my aunt,

 " and we need talk of this no more.      Give me a kiss, and we 1' 1 go to the
 Commons after breakfast to-morrow."
    We had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed. I slept in a
room on the same floor with my aunt's, and was a little disturbed in the
course of the night by her knocking at my door, as often as she was
agitated by a distant sound of hackney-coaches or market-carts, and inquir-
ing " if I heard the engines?" But towards morning she slept better,
and suffered me to do so too.
    At about mid-day, we set out for the offices of Messrs. Spenlow and
Jorkins in Doctors' Commons. My aunt, who had this other general
opinion in reference to London, that every man she saw was a pickpocket,
gave me her purse to carry for her, which had ten guineas in it and some
silver.
    We made a pause at the toy-shop in Fleet-street, to see the giants of
Saint Dunstan's strike upon the bells-we had timed our going, so as to
catch them at it, at twelve o'clock-and then went on towards Ludgate
Hill, and St. Paul's Churchyard. We were crossing to the former place,
when I found that my aunt greatly accelerated her speed, and looked
frightened. I observed, at the same time, that a lowering ill-dressed man
who had stopped and stared at us in passing, a little before, was coming
so close after us, as to brush against her.
   "Trot! My dear Trot !" cried my aunt, in a terrified whisper, and
pressing my arm. "I don't know what I am to do."
246           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   " Don't be alarmed," said I.    " There's nothing to be afraid of.  Step
into a shop, and 1'11 soon get rid of this fellow."
   " No, no, child ! " she returned. " Don't speak to him for the world.
I entreat, I order you! "
   " Good Heaven, aunt ! " said I. " He is nothing but a sturdy beggar."
   " You don't know what he is ! " replied my aunt. "You don't know
who he is ! You don't know what you say ! "
   We had stopped in an empty doorway, while this was passing, and he
had stopped too.
   " Don't look at him ! " said my aunt, as I turned my head indignantly,
" but get me a coach, my dear, and wait for me in St. Paul's Churchyard."
   " Wait for you? " I repeated.
   " Yes," rejoined my aunt, " I must go alone. I must go with him."
   " With him, aunt ? This man ? "
   "I am in my senses," she replied, and I tell you I must. Get me a
coach ! "
   However much astonished I might be, I was sensible that I had no right
to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command. I hurried away a
few paces, and called a hackney chariot which was passing empty. Almost
before I could let down the steps, my aunt sprang in, I don't know how,
and the man followed. She waved her hand to me to go away, so
earnestly, that, all confounded as I was, I turned from them at once. I n
doing so I heard her say to the coachman, "Drive anywhere! Drive
straight on! " and presently the chariot passed me, going up the hill.
   What Mr. Dick had told me, and what I had supposed to be a delusion
of his, now came into my mind. I could not doubt that this person was
the person of whom he had made such mysterious mention, though what
the nature of his hold upon my aunt could possibly be, I was quite unable
to imagine. After half an hour's cooling in the churchyard, I saw the
chariot coming back. The driver stopped beside me, and my aunt was
sitting in it alone.
   She had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite
prepared for the visit we had to make. She desired me to get into the
chariot, and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up and down a little
while. She said no more, except, "My dear child, never ask me what it
was, and don't refer to it," until she had perfectly regained her compo-
sure, when she told me she was quite herself now, and we might get out.
On her giving me her purse, to pay the driver, I found that all the
guineas were gone, and only the loose silver remained.
   Doctors' Commons was approached by a little low archway. Before
we had taken many paces down the street beyond it, the noise of the city
seemed to melt, as if by magic, into a softened distance. A few dull
 courts, and narrow ways, brought us to the sky-lighted offices of Spenlow
and Jorkins ; in the vestibule of which temple, accessible to pilgrims with-
out the ceremony of knocking, three or four clerks were at work as
copyists. One of these, a little dry man, sitting by himself, who wore a
stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread, rose to
receive my aunt, and show us into Mr. Spenlow's room.
    "Mr. Spenlow's in Court, ma'am," said the dry man; "it's an Arches
day ; but it's close by, and I'll send for him directly."
   As we were left to look about us while Mr. Spenlow was fetched, I
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          247
availed myself of the opportunity. The furniture of the room was old-
fashioned and dusty; and the green baize on the top of the writing-table
had lost all its color, and was as withered and pale as an old pauper.
There were a great many bundles of papers on it, some indorsed as Allega-
tions, and some (to my surprise) as Libels, and some as being in the
Consistory Court, and some in the Arches Court, and some in the Prero-
gativecourt, and some in the Admiralty Court, and some in the Delegates'
Court ; giving me occasion to wonder much, how many Courts there might
be in the gross, and how long it would take to understand them all.
Besides these, there were sundry immense manuscript Books of Evidence
taken on affidavit, strongly bound, and tied together in massive sets, a set
to each cause, as if every cause were a history in ten or twenty volumes.
All this looked tolerably expensive, I thought, and gave me an agreeable
notion of a proctor's business. I was casting my eyes with increasing
complacency over these and many similar objects, when hasty footsteps
were heard in the room outside, and Mr. Spenlow, in a black gown
trimmed with white fur, came hurrying in, taking off his hat as he came.
   H e was a little light-haired gentleman, with undeniable boots, and the
stiffest of white cravats and shirt-collars. He was buttoned up, mighty
trim and tight, and must have taken a great deal of pains with his
whiskers, which were accurately curled. His gold watch-chain was
so massive, that a fancy came across me, that he ought to have a sinewy
golden arm, to draw it out with, like those which are put up over the gold-
beaters' shops. H e was got up with such care, and was so stiff, that
he could hardly bend himself; being obliged, when he glanced at some
papers on his desk, after sitting down in his chair, to move his whole body,
from the bottom of his spine, like Punch.
    I had previously been presented by my aunt, and had been courteously
received. He now said :
    I' And so, Mr. Copperfield, you think of entering into our profession ?

I casually mentioned to Miss Trotwood, when I had the pleasure of
an interview with her the other day,"-with another inclination of his
body-Punch again-" that there was a vacancy here. Miss Trotwood
was good enough to mention that she had a nephew who was her peculiar
care, and for whom she was seeking to provide genteelly in life. That
nephew, I believe, I have now the pleasure of "-Punch again.
    I bowed my acknowledgments, and said, my aunt had mentioned to
me that there was that opening, and that I believed I should like it very
much. That I was strongly inclined to like it, and had taken imme-
diately to the proposal. That I could not absolutely pledge myself to like
it, until I knew something more about it. That although it was little else
than a matter of form, I presumed I should have an opportunity of trying
how I liked it, before I bound myself to it irrevocably.
    " Oh surely ! surely ! " said Mr. Spenlow. " We always, in this house,
propose a month-an initiatory month. I should be happy, myself, to
propose two months-three-an         indefinite period, in fact-but I have a
partner. Mr. Jorkins."
    'I And the premium, sir," I returned, " is a thousand pounds ?"

   <' And the premium, Stamp included, is a thousand pounds," said
Mr. Spenlow. " As I have mentioned to Miss Trotwood, I am actuated
by no mercenary considerations; few men are less so, I believe; but
248           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

Mr. Jorkins has his opinions on these subjects, and I am bound to respect
 Mr. Jorkins's opinions. Mr. Jorkins thinks a thousand pounds too little,
in short."
   " I suppose, sir," said I, still desiring to spare my aunt, "that it isnot

the custom here, if an articled clerk were particularly useful, and made
himself a perfect master of his profession-" I could not help blushing,
this looked so like praising myself-" I suppose it is not the custom, in
the later years of his time, to allow him any-"
   Mr. Spenlow, by a great effort, just lifted his head far enough out of his
cravat to shake it, and answered, anticipating the word " salary :"
   "No. I will not say what consideration I might give to that point
mvself. Mr. Coooerfield. if I were unfettered. Mr. Jorkins is immovable."
  d

   I was quite &mayea by the idea of this terrible Jorkins. But I found
out afterwards that he was a mild man, of a heavy temperament, whose
place in the business was to keep himself in the back-ground, and be
constantly exhibited by name as the most obdurate and ruthless of men.
If a clerk wanted his salary raised, Mr. Jorkins wouldn't listen to such a
proposition. If a client were slow to settle his bill of costs, Mr. Jorkins
was resolved to have it paid; and however painful these things might
be (and always were) to the feelings of Mr. Spenlow, Mr. Jorkins would
have his bond. The heart and hand of the good angel Spenlow would
have been always open, but for the restraining demon Jorkins. As I have
grown older, I think I have had experience of some other houses doing
business on the principle of Spenlow and Jorkins !
   It was settled that I should begin my month's probation as soon as I
pleased, and that my aunt need neither remain in town nor return at its
expiration, as the articles of agreement, of which I was to be the subject,
could easily be sent to her at home for her signature. When we had got
so far, Mr. Spenlow offered to take me into Court then and there, and
show me what sort of place it was. As I was willing enough to know, we
went out with this object, leaving my aunt behind; who would trust
herself, she said, in no such place, and who, I think, regarded all Courts
of Law as a sort of powder-mills that might blow up at any time.
   Mr. Spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave
brick houses, which I inferred, from the Doctors' names upon the doors, to
be the official abiding-places of the learned advocates of whom Steerforth
had told me; and into a large dull room, not unlike a chapel to my
thinking, on the left hand. The upper part of this room was fenced off
from the rest; and there, on the two sides of a raised platform of the
horse-shoe form, sitting on easy old-fashioned dining-room chairs, were
sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs, whom I found to be the
Doctors aforesaid, Blinking over a little desk like a pulpit-desk, in the
curve of the horse-shoe, was an old gentleman, whom, if I had seen him
in an aviary, I should certainly have taken for an owl, but who I learned
was the presiding judge. I n the space within the horse-shoe, lower
than these, that is to say, on about the level of the floor, were sundry
other gentlemen, of Mr. Spenlow's rank, and dressed like him in black
gowns with white fur upon them, sitting at a long green table. Their
cravats were in general stiff, I thought, and their looks haughty; but in
this last respect I presently conceived I had done them an injustice, for
when two or three of them had to rise and answer a question of the
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          249
presiding dignitary, I never saw anything more sheepish. The public,
represented by a boy with a comforter, and a shabby-genteel man secretly
eating crumbs out of his coat pockets, was warming itself at a stove in the
centre of the Court. The languid stillness of the place was only broken
by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the Doctors, who
was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence, and stopping
to put up, from time to time, at little roadside inns of argument on the
journey. Altogether, I have never, on any occasion, made one at such
a cosey, dosey, old-fashioned, time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little family-
party in all my life; and I felt it would be quite a soothing opiate to
belong to it in any character-except perhaps as a suitor.
   Very well satisfied with the dreamy nature of this retreat, I informed
Mr. Spenlow that I had seen enough for that time, and we rejoined my
aunt ; in company with whom I presently departed from the Commons,
feeling very young when I went out of Spenlow and Jorkins's, on account
of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out.
   We arrived at Lincoln's Inn Fields without any new adventures, except
encountering an unlucky donkey in a costermonger's cart, who suggested
painful associations to my aunt. We had another long talk about my
plans, when we were safely housed; and as I knew she was anxious to get
home, and, between fire, food, and pickpockets, could never be considered
at her ease for half-an-hour in London, I urged her not to be uncom-
fortable on my account, but to leave me to take care of myself.
   " I have not been here a week to-morrow, without considering that too,
my dear," she returned. " There is a furnished little set of chambers to
be let in the Adelphi, Trot, which ought to suit you to a marvel."
   With this brief introduction, she produced from her pocket an adver-
tisement, carefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that in Buck-
ingham Street in the Adelphi there was to be let, furnished, with a view
of the river, a singularly desirable, and compact set of chambers, forming
a genteel residence for a young gentleman, a member of one of the Inns of
Court, or otherwise, with immediate possession. Terms moderate, and
could be taken for a month only if required.
   "Why, this is the very thing, aunt ! " said I, flushed with the possible
dignity of living in chambers.
   " Then come," replied my aunt, immediately resuming the bonnet she

had a minute before laid aside. "We 1' 1 go and look at 'em."
   Away we went. The advertisement directed us to apply to Mrs. Crupp
on the premises, and we rung the area bell, which we supposed to com-
municate with Mrs. Crupp. I t was not until we had rung three or four
times that we could prevail on Mrs. Crupp to communicate with us, but
at last she appeared, being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel petticoat
below a nankeen gown.
   "Let us see these chambers of yours, if you please, ma'am," said
my aunt.
   "For this gentleman?" said Mrs. Crupp, feeling in her pocket for
her keys.
   " Yes, for my nephew," said my aunt.
   "And a sweet set they is for sich ! " said Mrs. Crupp.
   So we went up-stairs.
   They were on the top of the house-a great point with my aunt, being
 250            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  near the fire-escape--and consisted of a little half-blind entry where you
  could see hardly anything, a little stone-blind pantry where you could see
  nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a bed-room. The furniture was rather
  faded, but quite good enough for me; and, sure enough, the river was
 outside the windows.
    As I was delighted with the place, my aunt and Mrs. Crupp withdrew
 into the pantry to discuss the terms, while I remained on the sitting-
 room sofa, hardly daring to think it possible that I could be destined to
live in such a noble residence. After a single combat of some duration
they returned, and I saw, to my joy, both in Mrs. Crupp's countenance
 and in my aunt's, that the deed was done.
    " Is it the last occupant's furniture? " inquired my aunt.
    " Yes it is, ma'am," said Mrs. Crupp.

    " What's become of him? " asked my aunt.

    Mrs. Crupp was taken with a troublesome cough, in the midst of which
she articulated with much difficulty. " He was took ill here, ma'am, and
-ugh ! ugh ! ugh ! dear me !-and he died."
    " Hey ! What did he die of? " asked my aunt.
    " Well, ma'am, he died of drink," said Mrs. Crupp in confidence. "And

smoke."
    " Smoke? You don't mean chimneys ? " said my aunt.

    " No, ma'am," returned Mrs. Crupp. " Cigars and pipes."
    " That's not catching, Trot, at any rate," remarked my aunt, turning
to me.
    " No, indeed," said I.
    I n short, my aunt, seeing how enraptured I was with the premises, took
 them for a month, with leave to remain for twelve months when that time
was out. Mrs. Crupp was to find linen, and to cook ;every other neces-
sary was already provided ; and Mrs. Crupp expressly intimated that she
should always yearn towards me as a son. I was to take possession the
day after to-morrow, and Mrs. Crupp said thank Heaven she had now
found summun she could care for !
    On our way back, my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted
that the life I was now to lead would make me firm and self-reliant,
which was all I wanted. She repeated this several times next day, in the
intervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes and books
from Mr.Wickfield's; relative to which, and to all my late holiday, I wrote
a long letter to Agnes, of which my aunt took charge, as she was to
leave on the succeeding day. Not to lengthen these particulars, I need
only add, that she made a handsome provision for all my possible wants
during my month of trial ; that Steerforth, to my great disappointment
and hers too, did not make his appearance before she went away ; that I
saw her safely seated in the Dover coach, exulting in the coming discom-
fiture of the vagrant donkeys, with Janet at her side; and that when
the coach was gone, I turned my face to the Adelphi, pondering on the
old days when I used to roam about its subterranean arches, and on the
happy changes which had brought me to the surface.
                         OF DAVID    COPPERFIELD.



                           CHAPTER XXIV.
                         MY FIRST DISSIPATION.

   ITwas a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself, and
to feel, when I shut my outer door, like Robinson Crusoe, when he had
got into his fortification, and pulled his ladder up after him. I t was
a wonderfully fine thing to walk about town with the key of my house in
my pocket, and to know that I could ask any fellow to come home, and
make quite sure of its being inconvenient to nobody, if it were not so to
me. I t was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out, and to
come and go without a word to any one, and to ring Mrs. Crupp up,
gasping, from the depths of the earth, when I wanted her-and when
she was disposed to come. All this, I say, was wonderfully fine ; but I
must say, too, that there were times when it was very dreary.
   I t was fine in the morning, particularly in the fine mornings. I t
looked a very fresh, free life, by daylight : still fresher, and more free, by
sunlight. But as the day declined, the life seemed to go down too. I
don't know how it was ; it seldom looked well by candle-light. I wanted
somebody to talk to, then. I missed Agnes. I found a tremendous
blank, in the place of that smiling repository of my confidence. Mrs.
Crupp appeared to be a long way off. I thought about my predecessor,
who had died of drink and smoke; and I could have wished he had been so
good as to live, and not bother me with his decease.
   After two days and nights, I felt as if I had lived there for a year, and
yet I was not an hour older, but was quite as much tormented by my
own youthfulness as ever.
   Steerforth not yet appearing, which induced me to apprehend that he
must be ill, I left the Commons early on the third day, and walked out to
Highgate. Mrs. Steerforth was very glad to see me, and said that he had
gone away with one of his Oxford friends to see another who lived near
St. Albans, but that she expected him to return to-morrow. I was so
fond of him, that I felt quite jealous of his Oxford friends.
   As she pressed me to stay to dinner, I remained, and I believe we talked
about nothing but him all day. I told her how much the people liked
him at Yarmouth, and what a delightful companion he had been. Miss
Dartle was full of hints and mysterious questions, but took a great
interest in all our proceedings there, and said, " Was it really, though?" and
so forth, so often, that she got everything out of me she wanted to know.
Her appearance was exactly what I have described it, when I first saw
her; but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable, and came so
natural to me, that I felt myself falling a little in love with her. I could
not help thinking, several times in the course of the evening, and parti-
cularly when I walked home at night, what delightful company she would
be in Buckingham Street.
   I was taking my coffee and roll in the morning, before going to the
Commons-and I may observe in this place that it is surprising how
much coffee Mrs. Crupp used, and how weak it was, considering-when
Steerforth himself walked in, to my unbounded joy.
252            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " My dear Steerforth," cried I, " I began to think I should never see
 you again !"
    " I was carried off, by force of arms," said Steerforth, " the very next

 morning after I got home. Why, Daisy, what a rare old bachelor you
 are here !"
    I showed him over the establishment, not omitting the pantry, with
 no little pride, and he commended it highly. " I tell you what, old boy,"
 he added, " I shall make quite a town-house of this place, unless you give
 me notice to quit."
    This was a delightful hearing. I told him if he waited for that, he
 would have to wait till doomsday.
    "But you shall have some breakfast ! " said I, with my hand on the
 bell-rope, "and Mrs. Crupp shall make you some fresh coffee, and I'll
 toast you some bacon in a bachelor's Dutch-oven that I have got here."
    "No, no ! " said Steerforth. "Don't ring ! I can't ! I am going to
 breakfast with one of these fellows who is at the Piazza Hotel, in Covent
 Garden."
    " But you'll come back to dinner ? " said I.

    " I can't, upon my life.   There's nothing I should like better, but I
must remain with these two fellows. We are all three off together
to-morrow morning."
    " Then bring them here to dinner," I returned.      " Do you think they
 would come? "
    " Oh ! they would come fast enough," said Steerforth ; " but we should
inconvenience you. You had better come and dine with us somewhere."
    I would not by any means consent to this, for it occurred to me that I
really ought to have a little housewarming, and that there never could be
 a better opportunity. I had a new pride in my rooms after his approval
of them, and burned with a desire to develop their utmost resources.
I therefore made him promise positively in the names of his two friends,
and we appointed six o'clock as the dinner-hour.
   When he was gone, I rang for Mrs. Crupp, and acquainted her with my
desperate design. Mrs. Crupp said, in the first place, of course it was
well known she couldn't be expected to wait, but she knew a handy
young man, who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it, and
whose terms would be five shillings, and what I pleased. I said, cer- ,
tainly we would have him. Next, Mrs. Crupp said it was clear she couldn't
be in two places at once (which I felt to be reasonable), and that " a young
gal" stationed in the pantry with a bed-room candle, there never to desist
from washing plates, would be indispensable. I said, what would be the
expense of this young female, and Mrs. Crupp said she supposed
eighteen-pence would neither make me nor break me. I said I supposed
not; and that was settled. Then Mrs. Crupp said, Now about the dinner.
   I t was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of the
ironmonger who had made Mrs. Crupp's kitchen fire-place, that it was
capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes. As to a fish-
kittle, Mrs. Crupp said, well ! would I only come and look at the range.
She couldn't say fairer than that. Would I come and look at i t ? As I
should not have been much the wiser if I had looked at it, I declined, and
said, " Never mind fish." But Mrs. Crupp said, Don't say that ;oysters
was in, and why not them? So that was settled. Mrs. Crupp then
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           253
said what she would recommend would be this. A pair of hot roast fowls
-from the pastry-cook's; a dish of stewed beef, with vegetables-from
the pastry-cook's ; two little corner things, as a raised pie and a dish of
kidneys-from the pastry-cook's ; a tart, and (if I liked) a shape of jelly
-from the pastry-cook's. This, Mrs. Crupp said, would leave her at full
liberty to concentrate her mind on the potatoes, and to serve up the cheese
and celery as she could wish to see it done.
    I acted on Mrs. Crupp's opinion, and gave the order at the pastry-cook's
myself. Walking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard
mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop, which resembled
marble, but was labelled " Mock Turtle," I went in and bought a slab of
it, which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for fifteen
people. This preparation, Mrs. Crupp, after some difficulty, consented to
warm up ; and it shrunk so much in a liquid state, that we found it what
Steerforth called " rather a tight fit" for four.
    These preparations happily completed, I bought a little dessert in Covent
Garden Market,and gave a rather extensive order at a retail wine-merchant's
in that vicinity. When I came home in the afternoon, and saw the bottles
drawn up in a square on the pantry-floor, they looked so numerous (though
there were two missing, which made Mrs. Crupp very uncomfortable), that
I was absolutely frightened at them.
    One of Steerforth's friends was named Grainger, and the other Markham.
They were both very gay and lively fellows ; Grainger, something older
than Steerforth ; Markham, youthful-looking, and I should say not more
than twenty. I observed that the latter always spoke of himself indefinitely,
as " a man," and seldom or never in the first person singular.
    "A man might get on very well here, Mr. Copperfield," said Markham-
meaning himself.
    "It's not a bad situation," said I, and the rooms are really
commodious."
    " I hope you have both brought appetites with you ? " said Steerforth.
    "Upon my honour," returned Markham, "town seems to sharpen a
man's appetite. A man is hungry all day long. A man is perpetually
eating."
    Being a little embarrassed at first, and feeling much too young to pre-
side, I made Steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was
announced, and seated myself opposite to him. Everything was very
good; we did not spare the wine ; and he exerted himself so brilliantly to
make the thing pass off well, that there was no pause in our festivity. I
was not quite such good company during dinner, as I could have wished
to be, for my chair was opposite the door, and my attention was distracted
by observing that the handy young man went out of the room very often,
and that his shadow always presented itself, immediately afterwards, on the
wall of the entry, with a bottle at its mouth. The "young gal" likewise
occasioned me some uneasiness : not so much by neglecting to wash the
plates, as by breaking them. For being of an inquisitive disposition, and
unable to confine herself (as her positive instructions were) to the pantry,
she was constantly peering in at us, and constantly imagining herself
detected; in which belief, she several times retired upon the plates (with
which she had carefully paved the floor), and did a great deal of destruction.
    These, however, were small drawbacks, and easily forgotten when the
254            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

cloth was cleared, and the dessert put on the table ; at which period of
the entertainment the handy young man was discovered to be speechless.
Giving him private directions to seek the society of Mrs. Crupp, and to
remove the "young gal" to the basement also, I abandoned myself to
enjoyment.
    I began, by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted; all sorts of
half-forgotten things to talk about, came rushing into my mind, and made
me hold forth in a most unwonted manner. I laughed heartily at my
own jokes, and everybody else's ; called Steerforth to order for not passing
the wine; made several engagements to go to Oxford ; announced that I
meant to have a dinner party exactly like that, once a week until further
notice ; and madIy took so much snuff out of Grainger's box, that I was
obliged to go into the pantry, and have a private fit of sneezing ten
minutes long.
    I went on, by passing the wine faster and faster yet, and continually
starting up with a corkscrew to open more wine, long before any was
needed. I proposed Steerforth's health. I said he was my dearest
friend, the protector of my boyhood, and the companion of my prime. I
said I was delighted to propose his health. I said I owed him more
obligations than I could ever repay, and held him in a higher admiration
than I could ever express. I finished by saying, "I'll give you Steerforth !
God bless him ! Hurrah ! " We gave him three times three, and another,
and a good one to finish with. I broke my glass in going round the
table to shake hands with him, and I said (in two words) " Steerforth-
you'retheguidingstarofmyexist ence."
   I went on, by finding suddenly that somebody was in the middle of a
song. Markham was the singer, and he sang "When the heart of a man
is depressed with care." He said, when he had sung it, he would give us
"Woman ! " I took objection to that, and I couldn't allow it. I said it
was not a respectful way of proposing the toast, and I would never
permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise than as "The
Ladies! " I was very high with him, mainly I think because I saw
Steerforth and Grainger laughing at me-or at him-or at both of us.
H e said a man was not to be dictated to. I said a man was. He said a
man was not to be insulted, then. I said he was right there-never
under my roof, where the Lares were sacred, and the laws of hospitality
paramount.      He said it was no derogation from a man's dignity to
confess that I was a devilish good fellow. I instantly proposed his
health.
    Somebody was smoking. We were all smoking. I was smoking, and
trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder. Steerforth had made a
speech about me, in the course of which I had been affected almost to tears.
I returned thanks, and hoped the present company would dine with me
to-morrow, and the day after-each day at five o'clock, that we might
enjoy the pleasures of conversation and society through a long evening.
I felt called upon to propose an individual. I would give them my aunt.
Miss Betsey Trotwood, the best of her sex!
    Somebody was leaning out of my bed-room window, refreshing his
forehead against the cool stone of the parapet, and feeling the air upon his
 face. It was myself. I was addressing myself as Copperfield," and
                                                       '(
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         255
 saying, "Why did you try to smoke? You might have known you
 couldn't do it." Now, somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features
 in the looking-glass. That was I too. I was very pale in the looking-
 glass; my eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hair-only my hair,
 nothing else-looked drunk.
    Somebody said to me, " Let us go to the theatre, Copperfield !" There
 was no bed-room before me, but again the jingling table covered with
 glasses ; the lamp ; Grainger on my right hand, Markham on my left, and
 Steerforth opposite-all sitting in a mist, and a long way off. The
 theatre? To besure. The very thing. Come along! But they must
 excuse me if I saw everybody out first, and turned the lamp off-in case
 of fire.
    Owing to some confusion in the dark, the door was gone. I was feeling
 for it in the window-curtains, when Steerforth, laughing, took me by the
 arm and led me out. We went down-stairs, one behind another. Near
the bottom, somebody fell, and rolled down. Somebody else said it was
 Copperfield. I was angry at that false report, until, finding myself on my
back in the passage, I began to think there might be some foundation
for it.
    A very foggy night, with great rings round the lamps in the streets !
There was an indistinct talk of its being wet. I considered it frosty.
Steerforth dusted me under a lamp-post, and put my hat into shape,
which somebody produced from somewhere in a most extraordinary
manner, for I hadn't had it on before. Steerforth then said, " You are all
right, Copperfield, are you not? " and I told him, " Neverberrer."
   A man, sitting in a pigeon-hole-place, looked out of the fog, and took
money from somebody, inquiring if I was one of the gentlemen paid for,
and appearing rather doubtful (as I remember in the glimpse I had of
him) whether to take the money for me or not. Shortly afterwards, we
were very high up in a very hot theatre, looking down into a large
pit, that seemed to me to smoke; the people with whom it was
crammed were so indistinct. There was a great stage, too, looking very
clean and smooth after the streets ; and there were people upon it, talking
about something or other, but not at all intelligibly. There was an
abundance of bright lights, and there was music, and there were ladies
down in the boxes, and I don't know what more. The whole building
looked to me, as if it were learning to swim; it conducted itself in such
an unaccountable manner, when I tried to steady it.
    On somebody's motion, we resolved to go down-stairs to the dress-
boxes, where the ladies were. A gentleman lounging, full dressed, on a
sofa, with an opera-glass in his hand, passed before my view, and also my
own figure at full length in a glass. Then I was being ushered into one
of these boxes, and found myself saying something as I sat down,
and people about me crying " Silence ! " to somebody, and ladies casting
indignant glances at me, and-what ! yes !-Agnes, sitting on the seat
before me, in the same box, with a lady and gentleman beside her,
whom I didn't know. I see her face now, better than I did then I dare
say, with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me.
    " Agnes ! " I said, thickly, " Lorblessmer ! Agnes ! "

    " Hush ! Pray ! " she answered, I could not conceive why. a You
disturb the company. Look at the stage ! "
256            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    I tried, on her injunction, to fix it, and to hear something of what
was going on there, but quite in vain. I looked at her again by-and-by,
 and saw her shrink into her corner, and put her gloved hand to her
forehead.
    " Agnes ! " I said.  " I'mafraidyou'renorwell.~'

    '< Yes, yes. Do not mind me, Trotwood," she returned. " Listen !
Are you going away soon ? "
    " Amigoarawaysoo ? " I repeated.
    'I Yes."

   I had a stupid intention of replying that I was going to wait, to hand
her down-stairs. I suppose I expressed it, somehow; for after she had
looked at me attentively for a little while, she appeared to understand,
and replied in a low tone :
    " I know you will do as I ask you, if I tell you I am very earnest in it.

 Go away now, Trotwood, for my sake, and ask your friends to take you
home."
    She had so far improved me, for the time, that though I was angry
with her, I felt ashamed, and with a short " Goori ! " (which I intended
for " Good night ! ") got up and went away. They followed, and I stepped
at once out of the box-door into my bedroom, where only Steerforth was
with me, helping me to undress, and where I was by turns telling him
that Agnes was my sister, and adjuring him to bring the corkscrew, that I
might open another bottle of wine.
    How somebody, lying in my bed, lay saying and doing all this over
again, at cross purposes, in a feverish dream all night-the          bed a
rocking sea that was never still ! How, as that somebody slowly settled
 down into myself, did I begin to parch, and feel as if my outer covering
 of skin were a hard board; my tongue the bottom of an empty kettle,
furred with long service, and burning up over a slow fire ; the palms of
my hands, hot plates of metal which no ice could cool !
   But the agony of mind, the remorse, and shame I felt, when I be-
came conscious next day ! My horror of having committed a thousand
offences I had forgotten, and which nothing could ever expiate-my recol-
lection of that indelible look which Agnes had given me-the torturing
impossibility of communicating with her, not knowing, Beast that I was,
how she came to be in London, or where she stayed-my disgust of the
very sight of the room where the revel had been held-my racking head-
the smell of smoke, the sight of glasses, the impossibility of going out, or
even getting up ! Oh, what a day it was !
   Oh, what an evening, when I sat down by my fire to a basin of mutton
broth, dimpled all over with fat, and thought I was going the way of
my predecessor, and should succeed to his dismal story as well as to
his chambers, and had half a mind to rush express to Dover and reveal
all ! What an evening, when Mrs. Crupp, coming in to take away the
broth-basin, produced one kidney on a cheese-plate as the entire remains
of yesterday's feast, and I was really inclined to fall upon her nankeen
breast, and say, in heartfelt penitence, " Oh, Mrs. Crupp, Mrs. Crupp,
never mind the broken meats ! I am very miserable ! "--only          that I
doubted, even at that pass, if Mrs. Crupp were quite the sort of woman to
confide in !

   IDER-DOWN contains the most warmth, with the least weight, of
E    any known substance; and this, combined with its freedom from
Stem or Quill, renders it, either for a Bed covering,

more agreeable,
                  AND ALSO MORE HEALTHFUL,
than any other covering.

  The EIDER-DOWN QUILT is strongly recommended by the most
eminent members of the faculty for the
    AGED AND INFIRM, AS WELL AS FOR INVALIDS.
  They are kept, in great variety of sizes and colours, and in Silk and
Cotton cases.

                            EDITED BY MRS. LOUDON.
            ASSISTED BY T H E MOST EMINENT W R I T E R S AND ARTISTS.

 T H E want of a First Class Periodical adapted to the Tastes and Pursuits of
       Women having been constantly urged upon me, I have projected, with an earnest desire
 for the Improvement and Elevation of the Female Character, and in conjunction with some of
 the best names in Literature and Art-
        T H E LADIES' COMPANION A T HOME AND ABROAD.
       The first point will be to enforce the necessity of Mental Cultivation. I n educating female
  children, we too often give an undue importance to accomplishments, forgetting that they are the
  adjunctg and not the principal object ;only the garnishing to the solid food ; useful to make girls
  agreeable in society; but not enough to make them good wives and mothers, or, a t any rate,
 valuable members of the community.
      The Influence of Women in Society, and the necessity for their mental cultivation, are now
 generally acknowledged ; and the old fancy, that learning must make women pedantic and dis-
 agreeable, is rapidly passing away. I t is true that there are some pedantic women, who are exceed-
 ingly disagreeable ; but are there not also pedantic men, who are just a s much so ? And yet no
 one, I believe, ever yet proposed to deny the benefit of mental cultivation to all men, because the
 brains of some few are found too weak to bear it.
      To make women agreeable social companions to their husbands and other male relations, i t is
 necessary for them to be acquainted with many Matters of General Information, continually
 recurring in books and conversation, which are not usually taught in girls' schools ;and it will be
 endeavoured, in the present work, to give young persons such a IEnowledge of the Arts and
 Sciences, and of Ancient and Modern Literature, as will enable them to take an interest in sub-
jects constantly spoken of, without penetrating into the depths of profound learning.
      Next to mental cultivation we place those Household Duties and Useful and Elegant Occupa-
 tions, in which women ought particularly to excel. I t is not enough for a woman to be the
 companion of her husband ; she must be his helpmate ; the tutelary genius of his house : she
 must watch over his domestic comforts while he is engaged in the fatiguing duties of active life ;
 and above all, she must make home comfortable to him, whether she does it merely by the careful
 performance of her household duties, or adds to them the graces of elegant accomplishments.
      I t is not only the poor man's wife who must attend to her Household Duties ; every woman
 has household duties to perform, though they vary according to her rank in life ; and in no one
 can we see the arduous duties of wife and mother more admirably carried out to their fullest
 extent than in the bright example held out to us by the Greatest, the Noblest, the most Honoured,
 and most Beloved Lady in the realm.
      One important feature of this work will be to Advocate the Causes of those Females who are
Compelled to Labour, either mentally or bodily, for their daily bread ; and to suggest some Means
of Employment for the Orphans of Clergymen, Artists, Officers, &c., who are, perhaps, more to
be pitied than any other class ;as to them the privations and mortifications they undergo are doubly
embittered by recollections of the delicacy with which they were reared, and by the refined
tastes and sensitive feelings which are almost inseparable from the education they have received.
     There are, of course, many minor points to be attended to, as, the Garden ; the Poultry-yard ;
Designs for Furniture, Fashions, and Work ;Reviews of Books ; In-door Occupations and Amuse-
ments, and many other incidental topics arising from circumstances, or from the wants or wishes of
our readers. The Illustrations will have frequent reference to the subjects just enumerated, but they
will also include delineations of whatever may be considered distinguished for interest or beauty.
    It must not, however, be supposed that the present publication is to take entirely a serious
character ; on the contrary, the aim will be to combine amusement with instruction, and to make
the lighter parts as entertaining as the more important parts are solid and valuable.

    WITHOUTentangling ourselves in political enquiries, as to the cause of the difficulties i n which all classes
 are occasionally involved,-without grappling with questions of free trade and unequal taxation,-without
 pauslng to enquire whether, or to what extent. our countrymen ought to seek aid from the Legislature,-
 it is our purpose t o attend them along another path: that path which they hitherto have successfully trod,
 and which every Briton delights t o pursue-the path of independence-with n o other support, under the blessing
 of God, than their own clear head, and their own strong arm.
      We are neither wise enough nor weak enough t o attempt to teach them how t o use those heads and a n n s
in their respective avocations-here we should have to be pupils, not teachers ; hut we do intend to place
before ourreaders such knowledge as, but for our pages, might remain unknown for years except t o the dis-
 coverers and their immediate neighbours.
       If we do not teach how to earn, we shall do that which is equally important-we shall show how t o save.
 Not a class in all British Society but will find in our pages suggestions available either for the management of
their establishments both within doors and without, the preparation for their food, or the cure of the bodily
 disarrangements both of themselves and of their domestic animals.
      To aid us in our purpose, those who do not flnd in our pages the information they require in the several
economic departments wherein we profess t o be instructors, have only t o furnish u s with their queries, and w e
promise to them speedy and well advised replies.
      Thus we hope t o he useful in the field, the yard, and the stall-but our utility will not berestridedtothese;
we hope to have held out to us many kind and gentle hands t o welcome us for what we may have t o suggest
lor the kitchen, the dairy, the wardrobe, and the parlour. We hope to bring knowledge that may heacceptable
to the daughters and wives of England-those, without whoseaidman may labour, but not thrive-may have a
house, and not a home; for where such helpmates are not, the quiet untiring pleasureaof one'sown fire-side-
the real meaning of " British comfort "-are never known. W e hope to be the means of remindtng those
helpmates of what may be done for the best beneath their roof-tree, both in health and in sickness-both for
ornament and for use-and though,,generally, they may be too well skilled in housewifery for u s t o impartto
them great, as well a s good suggestions, yet we shall not be uurewarded if we are useful in many trifles-for
he has not had much experience of life who has not learned that small savings, small comforts, and small plea-
sures, make up the fulness and the overflowing of a successful and happy existence.
      That we may achieve what we purpose we have obtained the aid of those whose names appear arranged
beneath our title-and we see in them, and in our good cause, a n earnest of success. Our coadjutors are a n
assemblage of those who are not only sound in head, but sound a t heart-those who, i n their several depart-
ments, have carried out in the broad daylight what they have studied by the aid of the lamp; and, above all,
we may add that they are those who have long been known a s having neverdipped theirpens i n gall, and who,
though well loving the jewels of life, are not altogether "of the earth-earthy."

                            CHAPTER XXV.
                         GOOD AND BAD ANGELS.

   I WAS going out at my door on the morning after that deplorable day
of headache, sickness, and repentance, with an odd confusion in my mind
relative to the date of my dinner-party, as if a body of Titans had taken
an enormous lever and pushed the day before yesterday some months
back, when I saw a ticket-porter coming up-stairs, with a letter in his
hand. He was taking his time about his errand, then; but when he saw
me on the top of the staircase, looking at him over the bannisters, he
swung into a trot, and came up panting as if he had run himself into a
state of exhaustion.
   " T. Copperfield, Esquire," said the ticket-porter, touching his hat with

his little cane.
   I could scarcely lay claim to the name : I was so disturbed by the con-
viction that the letter came from Agnes. However, I told him I was
T. Copperfield, Esquire, and he believed it, and gave me the letter, which
he said required an answer. I shut him out on the landing to wait for
the answer, and went into my chambers again, in such a nervous state
that I was fain to lay the letter down on my breakfast-table, and familiarise
myself with the outside of it a little, before I could resolve to break
the seal.
   I found, when I did open it, that it was a very kind note, containing no
reference to my condition at the theatre. All it said, was, "My dear
Trotwood. I am staying at the house of papa's agent, Mr. Waterbrook,
in Ely-place, Holborn. Will you come and see me to-day, at any time
you like to appoint? Ever yours affectionately, AGNES."
   I t took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my satis-
faction, that I don't know what the ticket-porter can have thought,
unless he thought I was learning to write. I must have written half a
dozen answers at least. I began one, " How can I ever hope, my dear
Agnes, to efface from your remembrance the disgusting impression "-
there I didn't like it, and then I tore it up. I began another, " Shakspeare
has observed, my dear Agnes, how strange it is that a man should put an
enemy into his mouth"-that         reminded me of Markham, and it got no
farther. I even tried poetry. I began one note, in a six-syllable line, " Oh do
not rememberM-but that associated itself with the fifth of November, and
became an absurdity. After many attempts, I wrote, " My dear Agnes.
Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher
praise than that ? I will come at four o'clock. Affectionately and sor-
rowfully, T. C." With this missive (which I was in twenty minds at once
about recalling, as soon as it was out of my hands), the ticket-porter at
last departed.
   I f the day were half as tremendous to any other professional gentleman
in Doctors' Commons as it was to me, I sincerely believe he made some
                                                                  S

expiation for his share in that rotten old ecclesiastical cheese. Although I
left the ofice at half-past three, and was prowling about the place of
appointment within a few minutes afterwards, the appointed time was
exceeded by a full quarter of an hour, according to the clock of St.
Andrew's, Holborn, before I could muster up sufficient desperation to pull
the private bell-handle let into the left-hand door-post of Mr. Waterbrook's
house.
   The professional business of Mr. Waterbrook's establishment was done
on the ground-floor, and the genteel business (of which there was a
good deal) in the upper part of the building. I was shown into a pretty
but rather close drawing-room, and there sat Agnes, netting a purse.
   She looked so quiet and good, and reminded me so strongly of my
airy fresh school days at Canterbury, and the sodden, smoky, stupid
wretch I had been the other night, that, nobody being by, I yielded to
my self-reproach and shame, and-in short, made a fool of myself. I
cannot deny that I shed tears. To this hour I am undecided whether it
was upon the whole the wisest thing I could have done, or the most
ridiculous.
   "If it had been any one but you, Agnes," said I, turning away my
head, " I should not have minded it half so much. But that it should
have been you who saw me ! I almost wish I had been dead, first."
   She put her hand-its touch was like no other hand-upon my arm
for a moment; and I felt so befriended and comforted, that I could not
help moving it to my lips, and gratefully kissing it.
   " Sit down," said Agnes, cheerfully.      "Don't be unhappy, Trotwood.
If you cannot confidently trust me, whom will you trust ? "
   " Ah, Agnes ! " I returned.     "You are my good Angel ! "
   She smiled rather sadly, I thought, and shook her head.
   " Yes, Agnes, my good Angel !       Always my good Angel ! "
   " If I were, indeed, Trotwood," she returned, " there is one thing
that I should set my heart on very much."
   I looked at her inquiringly ; but already with a foreknowledge of her
meaning.
   " On warning you," said Agnes, with a steady glance, "against your
bacl Angel."
   "My dear Agnes," I began, " if you mean Steerforth-"
    " I do, Trotwood," she returned.
    "Then, Agnes, you wrong him very much. H e my bad Angel, or any-
one's ! He, anything but a guide, a support, and a friend to me ! My
 dear Agnes ! Now, is it not unjust, and unlike you, to judge him from
what you saw of me the other night ? "
    " I do not judge him from what I saw of you the other night," she

 quietly replied.
    " From what, then? "

    "From many things-trifles in themselves, but they do not seem to
 me to be so, when they are put together. I judge him, partly from
 your account of him, Trotwood, and your character, and the influence he
 has over you."
    There was always something in her modest voice that seemed to touch
 a chord within me, answering to that sound alone. I t was always
 earnest; but when it was very earnest, as it was now, there was a thrill
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

in it that quite subdued me. I sat looking at her as she cast her eyes
down on her work; I sat seeming still to listen to her; and Steerforth,
in spite of all my attachment to him, darkened in that tone.
    " I t is very bold in me," said Agnes, looking up again, "who have
lived in such seclusion, and can know so little of the world, to give you
my advice so confidently, or even to have this strong opinion. But I
know in what it is engendered, Trotwood,-in how true a remembrance
of our having grown up together, and in how true an interest in all
relating to you. It is that which makes me bold. I am certain that what
I say is right. I am quite sure it is. I feel as if it were some one else
speaking to you, and not I, when I caution you that you have made a
dangerous friend."
    Again I looked at her, again I listened to her after she was silent, and
again his image, though it was still fixed in my heart, darkened.
    " I am not so unreasonable as to expect," said Agnes, resuming her

usual tone, after a little while, "that you will, or that you can, at once,
change any sentiment that has become a conviction to you; least of all a
sentiment that is rooted in your trusting disposition. You ought not
hastily to do that. I only ask you, Trotwood, if you ever think of me-
Imean" with a quiet smile, for I was going to interrupt her, and she
knew why " as often as you think of me-to think of what I have said.
Do you forgive me for all this ? "
    " I will forgive you, Agnes," I replied,       "when you come to do
Steerforth justice, and to like him as well as I do."
    " Not until then? " said Agnes.

    I saw a passing shadow on her face when I made this mention of him,
but she returned my smile, and we were again as unreserved in our
 mutual confidence as of old.
    " And when, Agnes," said I, "will you forgive me the other night ?"
    "When I recall it," said Agnes.
    She would have dismissed the subject so, but I was too full of it to
 allow that, and insisted on telling her how it happened that I had dis-
 graced myself, and what chain of accidental circumstances had had the
 theatre for its final link. I t was a great relief to me to do this, and to
 enlarge on the obligation that I owed to Steerforth for his care of me
 when I was unable to take care of myself.
    " You must not forget," said Agnes, calmly changing the conversation
 as soon as I had concluded, " that you are always to tell me, not only
 when you fall into trouble, but when you fall in love. Who has succeeded
 to Miss Larkins, Trotwood ? "
    ('No one, Agnes."
    "Some one, Trotwood," said Agnes, laughing, and holding up her
 finger.
    " No, Agnes, upon my word ! There is a lady, certainly, at Mrs.
  Steerforth's house, who is very clever, and whom I like to talk to-Miss
 Dartle-but I don't adore her."
    Agnes laughed again at her own penetration, and told me that if I were
 faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register
 of my violent attachments, with the date, duration, and termination of
 each, like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens, in the History
 of England. Then she asked me if I had seen Uriah.
                                                            s 2
260            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    '< Uriah Heep ? " said I. " No. I s he in London ? "
    "He comes to the office down-stairs, every day," returned Agnes.
" H e was in London a week before me. I am afraid on disagreeable
business, Trotwood."
    " On some business that makes you uneasy, Agnes, I see," said I.

" What can that be? "

    Agnes laid aside her work, and replied, folding her hands upon one
another, and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of hers :
    "I believe he is going to enter into partnership with papa."
    " What ? Uriah?     That mean, fawning fellow, worm himself into such
promotion?" I cried, indignantly. " Have you made no remonstrance
about it, Agnes? Consider what a connexion it is likely to be. You
must speak out. You must not allow your father to take such a mad
step. You must prevent it, Agnes, while there's time."
    Still looking at me, Agnes shook her head while I was speaking, with
a faint smile at my warmth : and then replied :
    "You remember our last conversation about papa? I t was not long
after that-not more than two or three days-when he gave me the first
intimation of what I tell you. I t was sad to see him struggling between
his desire to represent it to me as a matter of choice on his part, and his
inability to conceal that it was forced upon him. I felt very sorry."
    "Forced upon him, Agnes ! Who forces it upon him? "
    " Uriah," she replied, after a moment's hesitation, " has made himself
indispensable to papa. He is subtle and watchful. He has mastered
papa's weaknesses, fostered them, and taken advantage of them, until-to
say all that I mean in a word, Trotwood, until papa is afraid of him."
    There was more that she might have said; more that she knew, or that
 she suspected ; I clearly saw. I could not give her pain by asking what
it was, for I knew that she withheld it from me, to spare her father.
I t had long been going on to this, I was sensible: yes, I could not but
feel, on the least reflection, that it had been going on to this for a long
time. I remained silent.
    " His ascendancy over papa," said Agnes, "is very great.     He professes
humility and gratitude-with truth, perhaps : I hope so-but his position
is really one of power, and I fear he makes a hard use of his power."
    I said he was a hound, which, at the moment, was a great satisfaction
to me.
    "At the time I speak of, as the time when papa spoke to me," pursued
Agnes, " he had told papa that he was going away; that he was very
sorry, and unwilling to leave, but that he had better prospects. Papa
was very much depressed then, and more bowed down by care than ever
you or I have seen him ; but he seemed relieved by this expedient of the
partnership, though at the same time he seemed hurt by it and ashamed
of it."
    " And how did you receive it, Agnes ? "
    " I did, Trotwood," she replied, " what I hope was right. Feeling
sure that it was necessary for papa's peace that the sacrifice should be
made, I entreated him to make it. I said it would lighten the load of
his life-I hope it will !-and that it would give me increased opportuni-
ties of being his companion. Oh, Trotwood ! " cried Agnes, putting her
hands before her face, as her tears started on it, " I almost feel as if I
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                              261
 had been papa's enemy, instead of his loving child. For I know how he
  has altered, in his devotion to me. I know how he has narrowed the
  circle of his sympathies and duties, in the concentration of his whole
  mind upon me. I know what a multitude of things he has shut out
  for my sake, and how his anxious thoughts of me have shadowed his life,
  and weakened his strength and energy, by turning them always upon one
  idea. If I could ever set this right ! If I could ever work out his restoration,
  as I have so innocently been the cause of his decline ! "
     I had never before seen Agnes cry. I had seen tears in her eyes when
  I had brought new honours home from school, and I had seen them there
  when we last spoke about her father, and I had seen her turn her gentle
 head aside when we took leave of one another ; but I had never seen
 her grieve like this. I t made me so sorry that I could only say, in a
 foolish, helpless manner, " Pray, Agnes, don't ! Don't, my dear sister ! '
     But Agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose, as I know
 well now, whatever I might know or not know then, to be long in need
 of my entreaties. The beautiful, calm manner, which makes her so different
 in my remembrance from everybody else, came back again, as if a cloud
 had passed from a serene sky.
    "We are not likely to remain alone much longer," said Agnes, "and
 while I have an opportunity, let me earnestly entreat yon, Trotwood, to
 be friendly to Uriah. Don't repel him. Don't resent (as I think you
have a general disposition to do) what may be uncongenial to you in him.
 He may not deserve it, for we know no certain ill of him. I n any case,
think first of papa and me ! "
    Agnes had no time to say more, for the room-door opened, and Mrs.
Waterbrook, who was a large lady-or who wore a large dress : I don't
exactly know which, for I don't know which was dress and which was
lady-came sailing in. I had a dim recollection of having seen her at the
theatre, as if I had seen her in a pale magic lantern; but she appeared to
remember me perfectly, and still to suspect me of being in a state of
intoxication.
    Finding by degrees, however, that I was sober, and (I hope) that
I was a modest young gentleman, Mrs. Waterbrook softened towards
me considerably, and inquired, firstly, if I went much into the parks, and
secondly, if I went much into society. On my replying to both these
questions in the negative, it occurred to me that I fell again in her
good opinion; but she concealed the fact gracefully, and invited me to
dinner next day. I accepted the invitation, and took my leave; making
a call on Uriah in the office as I went out, and leaving a card for him in
his absence.
    When I went to dinner next day, and, on the street-door being
opened, plunged into a vapour-bath of haunch of mutton, I divined that
I was not the only guest; for I immediately identified the ticket-porter
in disguise, assisting the family servant, and waiting at the foot of the
stairs to carry up my name. H e looked, to the best of his ability, when
he asked me for it confidentially, as if he had never seen me before; but
well did I know him, and well did he know me. Conscience made cowards
of us both.
    I found Mr. Waterbrook to be a middle-aged gentleman, with a short
throat, and a good deal of shirt-collar, who only wanted a black nose to
262           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 be thc portrait of a pug-dog. H e told me he was happy to have the
 honour of making my acquaintance ; and when I had paid my homage to
 Mrs. Waterbrook, presented me, with much ceremony, to a very awful
lady in a black velvet dress, and a great black velvet hat, whom I remember
 as looking like a near relation of Hamlet's-say his aunt.
    Mrs. Henry Spiker was this lady's name ; and her husband was there
too : so cold a man, that his head, instead of being grey, seemed to be
 sprinkled with hoar-frost. Immense deference was shown to the Henry
Spikers, male and female ; which Agnes told me was on account of Mr.
Henry Spiker being solicitor to something or to somebody, I forget what
or which, remotely connected with the Treasury.
    I found Uriah Heep among the company, in a suit of black, and in
deep humility. H e told me, when I shook hands with him, that he was
proud to be noticed by me, and that he really felt obliged to me for my
condescension. I could have wished he had been less obliged to me, for
he hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening; and
whenever I said a word to Agnes, was sure, with his shadowless eyes and
cadaverous face, to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind.
   There were other guests-all iced for the occasion, as it struck me, like
the wine. But, there was one who attracted my attention before he
came in, on account of my hearing him announced as Mr. Traddles ! My
mind flew back to Salem House ; and could it be Tommy, I thought, who
used to draw the skeletons !
   I looked for Mr. Traddles with unusual interest. He was a sober,
steady-looking young man of retiring manners, with a comic head of
hair, and eyes that were rather wide open; and he got into an obscure
corner so soon, that I had some difficulty in making him out. At length
I had a good view of him, and either my vision deceived me, or it was
the old unfortunate Tommy.
   I made my way to Mr. Waterbrook, and said, that I believed I had
the pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there.
    " Indeed? " said Mr. Waterbrook, surprised.      " You are too young to

have been at school with Mr. Henry Spiker ? "
    " Oh, I don't    mean him ! " I returned. " I mean the gentleman
named Traddles."
   " Oh ! Aye, aye ! Indeed ! " said my host, with much diminished
interest. " Possibly."
   " If it's really the same person," said I, glancing towards him, " it was

at a place called Salem House where we were together, and he was an
excellent fellow."
   " Oh yes. Traddles is a good fellow," returned my host, nodding
his head with an air of toleration. " Traddles is quite a good fellow."
   " It's a curious coincidence," said I.

   " It is really," returned my host, " quite a coincidence, that Traddles
should be here at all : as Traddles was only invited this morning, when
the place at table, intended to be occupied by Mrs. Henry Spiker's brother,
became vacant, in consequence of his indisposition. A very gentlemanly
man, Mrs. Henry Spiker's brother, Mr. Copperfield."
    I murmured an assent, which was full of feeling, considering that I
knew nothing at all about him; and I inquired what Mr. Traddles was by
profession.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           263
   " Traddles," returned Mr. Waterbrook, "is a young manreading for the
bar.   Yes. He is quite a good fellow-nobody's      enemy but his own."
   " I s he his own enemy ? " said I, sorry to hear this.
     " Well," returned Mr. Waterbrook, pursing up his mouth, and playing

 with his watch-chain, in a comfortable, prosperous sort of way. " I
 should say he was one of those men who stand in their own light. Yes,
 I should say he would never, for example, be worth five hundred pound.
 Traddles was recommended to me, by a professional friend. Oh yes.
 Yes. He has a kind of talent, for drawing briefs, and stating a case in
 writing, plainly. I am able to throw something in Traddles's way, in the
 course of the year ; something-for him-considerable.          Oh yes. Yes."
    I was much impressed by the extremely comfortable and satisfied
 manner, in which Mr. Waterbrook delivered himself of this little word
 " Yes," every now and then. There was wonderful expression in it. It
 completely conveyed the idea of a man who had been born, not to say
 with a silver spoon, but with a scaling-ladder, and had gone on mounting
 all the heights of life one after another, until now he looked, from the top
 of the fortifications, with the eye of a philosopher and a patron, on the
 people down in the trenches.
    My reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was
announced. Mr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet's aunt. Mr. Henry
 Spiker took Mrs. Waterbrook. Agnes, whom I should have liked to take
myself, was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs. Uriah,
 Traddles, and I, as the junior part of the company, went down last, how
 we could. I was not so vexed at losing Agnes as I might have been
 since it gave me an opportunity of making myself known to Traddles on
the stairs, who greeted me with great fervor : while Uriah writhed with
such obtrusive satisfaction and self-abasement, that I could gladly have
pitched him over the bannisters.
    Traddles and I were separated at table, being billeted in two remote
corners : he in the glare of a red velvet lady; I, in the gloom of Hamlet's
aunt. The dinner was very long, and the conversation was about the
Aristocracy-and Blood. Mrs. Waterbrook repeatedly told us, that if she
had a weakness, it was Blood.
   I t occurred to me several times that we should have got on better, if we
had not been quite so genteel. We were so exceedingly genteel, that our
scope was very limited. A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party, who
had something to do at second-hand (at least, Mr. Gulpidge had) with
the law business of the Bank ; and what with the Bank, and what with the
Treasury, we were as exclusive as the Court Circular. To mend the matter,
Hamlet's aunt had the family failing of indulging in soliloquy, and held
forth in a desultory manner, by herself, on every topic that was introduced.
These were few enough, to be sure; but as we always fell back upon
Blood, she had as wide a field for abstract speculation as her nephew himself.
   We might have been a party of Ogres, the conversation assumed such a
sanguine complexion.
    " I confess I am of Mrs. Waterbrook's opinion," said Mr. Waterbrook,

with his wine-glass at his eye. " Other things are all very well in their
way, but give me Blood ! "
    " Oh ! There is nothing," observed Hamlet's aunt, " so satisfactory to
one ! There is nothing that is so much one's deau-ideal of-of all that sort
264           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

of thing, speaking generally. There are some low minds (not many, I am
happy to believe, but there are some) that would prefer to do what I
should call bow down before idols. Positively Idols ! Before services,
intellect, and so on. But these are intangible points. Blood is not so.
We see Blood in a nose, and we know it. We meet with it in a chin,
and we say, ' There it is ! That's Blood !' I t is an actual matter of fact.
We point it out. I t admits of no doubt."
    The simpering fellow with the weak legs, who had taken Agnes down,
stated the question more decisively yet, I thought.
    " Oh, you know, deuce take it," said this gentleman, looking round the

board with an imbecile smile, " we can't forego Blood, you know. We
must have Blood, you know. Some young fellows, you know, may be
a little behind their station, perhaps, in point of education and behaviour,
and may go a little wrong, you know, and get themselves and other people
into a variety of fixes-and all that-but deuce take it, it's delightful to
reflect that they've got Blood in 'em! Myself, I ' d rather at any time be
knocked down by a man who had got Blood in him, than I 'd be picked
 up by a man who hadn't !"
    This sentiment, as compressing the general question into a nutshell,
 gave the utmost satisfaction, and brought the gentleman into great notice
 until the ladies retired. After that, I observed that Mr. Gulpidge and
 Mr. Henry Spiker, who had hitherto been very distant, entered into a
 defensive alliance against us, the common enemy, and exchanged a myste-
 rious dialogue across the table for our defeat and overthrow.
     " That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds
 has not taken the course that was expected, Gulpidge," said Mr. Henry
 Spiker.
     " Do you mean the D. of A.'s? " said Mr. Spiker.
     " The C. of B.'s?" said Mr. Gulpidge.
     Mr. Spiker raised his eye-brows, and looked much concerned.
     " When the question was referred to Lord-I         needn't name him,'
 said Mr. Gulpidge, checking himself-
     '' I understand," said Mr. Spiker, " N."
     Mr. Gulpidge darkly nodded-" was referred to him, his answer was,
  ' Money, or no release.' "
     " Lord bless my soul!" cried Mr. Spiker.
     '' 'Money, or no release,"' repeated Mr. Gulpidge firmly. ' r The
 next in reversion-you understand me ?"
     " K. " said Mr. Spiker, with an ominous look.

     " -K. then positively refused to sign. He was attended at New-
 market for that purpose, and he point-blank refused to do it."
     Mr. Spiker was so interested, that he became quite stony.
     " So the matter rests at this hour," said Mr. Gulpidge, throwing him-
  self back in his chair. " Our friend Waterbrook will excuse me if I
 forbear to explain myself generally, on account of the magnitude of the
 interests involved."
     Mr. Waterbrook was only too happy, as it appeared to me, to have such
 interests, and such names, even hinted at, across his table. H e assumed
  an expression of gloomy intelligence (though I am persuaded he knew
  no more about the discussion than I did), and highly approved of the
  discretion that had been observed. Mr. Spiker, after the receipt of such
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           265
a confidence, naturally desired to favor his friend with a confidence of his
own; therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded by another, in
which it was Mr. Gulpidge's turn to be surprised, and that by another in
which the surprise came round to Mr. Spiker's turn again, and so on,
turn and turn about. All this time we, the outsiders, remained oppressed
by the tremendous interests involved in the conversation ; and our host
regarded us with pride, as the victims of a salutary awe and astonishment.
   I was very glad indeed to get up-stairs to Agnes, and to talk with her
in a corner, and to introduce Traddles to her, who was shy, but agreeable,
and the same good-natured creature still. As he was obliged to leave
early, on account of going away next morning for a month, I had not
nearly so much conversation with him as I could have wished; but we
exchanged addresses, and promised ourselves the pleasure of another
meeting when he should come back to town. He was greatly interested
to hear that I knew Steerforth, and spoke of him with such warmth that
I made him tell Agnes what he thought of him. But Agnes only looked
at me the while, and very slightly shook her head when only I observed her.
   -4s she was not among people with whom I believed she could be very
much at home, I was almost glad to hear that she was going away within
a few days, though I was sorry at the prospect of parting from her again
so soon. This caused me to remain until all the company were gone.
Conversing with her, and hearing her sing, was such a delightful reminder
to me of my happy life in the grave old house she had made so beautiful,
that I could have remained there half the night ; but, having no excuse
for staying any longer, when the lights of Mr. Waterbrook's society were
all snuffed out, I took my leave very much against my inclination. I felt
then, more than ever, that she was my better Angel; and if I thought of
her sweet face and placid smile, as though they had shone on me from
some removed being, like an Angel, I hope I thought no harm.
   I have said that the company were all gone; but I ought to have ex-
cepted Uriah, whom I don't include in that denomination, and who had
never ceased to hover near us. He was close behind me when I went
down-stairs. H e was close beside me, when I walked away from the
house, slowly fitting his long skeleton fingers into the still longer fingers
of a great Guy Pawkes pair of gloves.
   I t was in no disposition for Uriah's company, but in remembrance of
the entreaty Agnes had made to me, that I asked him if he would come
home to my rooms, and have some coffee.
    '' Oh, really, Master Copperfield," he rejoined,-" I beg your pardon,
Mister Copperfield, but the other comes so natural,-I        don't like that
you should put a constraint upon yourself to ask a numble person like
me to your ouse."
    "There is no constraint in the case," said I. "Will you come? "
    "I should like to, very much," replied Uriah, with a writhe.
    "Well, then, come along ! " said I.
    I could not help being rather short with him, but he appeared not to
 mind it. We went the nearest way, without conversing much upon the
road; and he was so humble in respect of those scarecrow gloves, that
he was still putting them on, and seemed to have made no advance in that
labour, when we got to my place.
    I led him up the dark stairs, to prevent his knocking his head against
266           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

anything, and really his damp cold hand felt so like a frog in mine, that
I was tempted to drop it and run away. A p e s and hospitality pre-
vailed, however, and I conducted him to my fireside. When I lighted
my candles, he fell into meek transports with the room that was revealed
to him ; and when I heated the coffee in an unassuming block-tin vessel,
in which Mrs. Crupp delighted to prepare it (chiefly, I believe, because
it was not intended for the purpose, being a shaving-pot, and because
there was a patent invention of great price mouldering away in the
pantry), he professed so much emotion, that I could joyfully have scalded
him.
    c ' Oh, really, Master Copperfield,-I     mean Mister Copperfield," said
Uriah, " t o see you waiting upon me is what I never could have ex-
pected! But, one way and another, so many things happen to me which
I never could have expected, I am sure, in my umble station, that it
seems to rain blessings on my ed. You have heard something, I des-say,
of a change in my expectations, Master Copperfield,-I should say, Mister
Copperfield ? "
    As he sat on my sofa, with his long knees drawn up under his coffee-
cup, his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him, his spoon going
softly round and round, his shadowless red eyes, which looked as if they
had scorched their lashes off, turned towards me without looking a t me,
the disagreeable dints I have formerly described in his nostrils coming
and going with his breath, and a snaky undulation pervading his frame
from his chin to his boots, I decided in my own mind that I disliked him
intensely. I t made me very uncomfortable to have him for a guest, for I
was young then, and unused to disguise what I so strongly felt.
     "You have heard something, I des-say, of a change in my expectations,
Master Copperfield,-I should say, Mister Copperfield? " observed Uriah.
    '' Yes," said I, "something."
    " Ah ! I thought Miss Agnes would know of it ! " he quietly returned.
" I ' m glad to find Miss Agnes knows of it. Oh, thank you, Master-
Mister Copperfield !"
    I could have thrown my bootjack at him (it lay ready on the rug), for
having entrapped me into the disclosure of anything concerning Agnes,
however immaterial. But I only drank my coffee.
    "What a prophet you have shown yourself, Nister Copperfield ! "
pursued Uriah. "Dear me, what a prophet you have proved yourself to
be ! Don't you remember saying to me once, that perhaps I should be
a partner in Mr. Wickfield's business, and perhaps it might be Wickfield
and Keep ! You may not recollect it ; but when a person is umble,
Master Copperfield, a person treasures such things up ! "
    " I recollect talking about it," said I, "though I certainly did not think

it very likely then."
    " Oh ! who would have thought it likely, Mister Copperfield ! " returned

Uriah, enthusiastically, " I am sure I didn't myself. I recollect saying
with my own lips that I was much too umble. So I considered myself
really and truly."
    H e sat, with that carved grin on his face, looking at the fire, as I looked
at him.
    " But the umblest persons, Master Copperfield," he presently resumed,
" may be the instruments of good.          I am glad to think I have been the
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

 instrument of good to Mr. Wickfield, and that I may be more so. Oh
 what a worthy man he is, Mister Copperfield, but how imprudent he has
 been ! "
     " I am sorry to hear it," said I. I could not help adding, rather
 pointedly, " on all accounts."
     " Decidedly so, Mister Copperfield," replied Uriah.      " On all accounts.
 Miss Agnes's above all ! You don't remember your own eloquent expres-
 sions, Master Copperfield; but I remember how you said one day that
 everybody must admire her, and how I thanked you for it ! You have
 forgot that, I have no doubt, Master Copperfield?"
     "No," said I, drily.
     " Oh how glad I am, you have not ! " exclaimed Uriah. " To think
 that you should be the first to kindle the sparks of ambition in my umble
 breast, and that you've not forgot it ! Oh !-Would you excuse me
 asking for a cup more coffee? "
    Something in the emphasis he laid upon the kindling of those sparks,
 and something in the glance he directed at me as he said it, had made me
 start as if I had seen him illuminated by a blaze of light. Recalled by his
request, preferred in quite another tone of voice, I did the honors of the
shaving-pot ; but I did them with an unsteadiness of hand, a sudden sense
of being no match for him, and a perplexed suspicious anxiety as to what
he might be going to say next, which I felt could not escape his observation.
    He said nothing at all. H e stirred his coffee round and round, he sipped
it, he felt his chin softly with his grisly hand, he looked at the fire, he looked
about the room, he gasped rather than smiled at me, he writhed and undu-
lated about, in his deferential servility, he stirred and sipped again, but he
left the renewal of the conversation to me.
    " So, Mr. Wickfield," said I , at last, "who is worth five hundred of
you-or me ;" for my life, I think I could not have helped dividing that
part of the sentence with an awkward jerk; "has been imprudent, has
he, Mr. Heep ? "
    " Oh very imprudent indeed, Master Copperfield," returned Uriah,
sighing modestly. " Oh very much so ! But I wish you'd call me
Uriah, if you please. I t ' s like old times."
    "Well! Uriah," said I , bolting it out with some difficulty.
    " Thank you ! " he returned, with fervor. " Thank you, Master Copper-
field ! I t 's like the blowing of old breezes or the ringing of old
bellses to hear you say Uriah. I beg your pardon. Was I making any
observation ? "
    " About Mr. Wickfield," I suggested.
    " Oh ! Yes, truly,"     said Uriah. "Ah ! Great imprudence, Master
Copperfield. I t ' s a topic that I wouldn't touch upon, to any soul but
you. Even to you I can only touch upon it, and no more. If any one
else had been in my place during the last few years, by this time he would
have had Mr. Wickfield (oh, what a worthy man he is, Master Copperfield,
too !) under his thumb. Un-der-his            thumb," said Uriah, very slowly,
as he stretched out his cruel-looking hand above my table, and pressed his
own thumb down upon it, until it shook, and shook the room.
    If I had been obliged to look at him with his splay foot on Mr. Wick-
field's head, I think I could scarcely have hated him more.
    " Oh dear, yes, Master Copperfield," he proceeded, in a soft voice, most
268            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 remarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb, which did not
 diminish its hard pressure in the least degree, " there's no doubt of it.
 There would have been loss, disgrace, I don't know what all. Mr.
 Wickfield knows it. I am the umble instrument of umbly serving him,
 and he puts me on an eminence I hardly could have hoped to reach. How
 thankful should I be ! " With his face turned towards me, as he finished,
 but without looking at me, he took his crooked thumb off the spot
 where he had ~ l a n t e dit, and slowly and thoughtfully scraped his lank jaw
 with it, as if he were shaving himself.
    I recollect well how indignantly my heart beat, as I saw his crafty face,
 with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it, preparing for some-
thing else.
    cr Master Copperfield," he began-"       but am I keeping you up ? "
    "You are not keeping me up. I generally go to bed late."
    "Thank you, Master Copperfield! I have risen from my umble
 station since first you used to address me, it is true; but I am umble still.
 I hope I never shall be otherwise than umble. You will not think the
worse of my umbleness, if I make a little confidence to you, Master
 Copperfield ? Will you? "
    " Oh, no," said I, with an effort.

       Thank you ! " H e took out his pocket-handkerchief, and began wiping
the palms of his hands. " Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield-"
    " Well, Uriah ? "

       Oh, how pleasant to be called Uriah, spontaneously ! " he cried ; and
 gave himself a jerk, like a convulsive fish. "You thought her looking
very beautiful to-night, Master Copperfield ? "
    " I thought her looking as she always does : superior, in all respects, to

every one around her," 1returned.
    " Oh, thank you !      I t 's so true ! " he cried. " Oh, thank you very
much for that ! "
    "Not at all," I said, loftily. "There is no reason why you should
thank me."
    "Why that, Master Copperfield," said Uriah, "is, in fact, the confi-
dence that I am going to take the liberty of reposing. Umble as I am,"
he wiped his hands harder, and looked at them and at the fire by turns,
" umble as my mother is, and lowly as our poor but honest roof has ever
been, the image of Miss Agnes (1 don't mind trusting you with my secret,
Master Copperfield, for I have always overflowed towards you since the
first moment I had the pleasure of beholding youin a poney-shay) has been
in my breast for years. Oh, Master Copperfield, with what a pure
affection do I love the ground my Agnes walks on ! "
   I believe I had a delirious idea of seizing the red-hot poker out of the
fire, and running him through with it. I t went from me with a shock,
like a ball fired from a rifle : but the image of Agnes, outraged by so much
as a thought of this red-headed animal's, remained in my mind when I
looked at him, sitting all awry as if his mean soul griped his body, and
made me giddy. He seemed to swell and grow before my eyes ; the room
seemed full of the echoes of his voice ; and the strange feeling (to which,
perhaps, no one is quite a stranger) that all this had occurred before, at
some indefinite time, and that I knew what he was going to say next, took
possession of me.
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            269
      A timely observation of the sense of power that there was in his face,
  did more to bring back to my remembrance the entreaty of Agnes, in its
  full force, than any effort I could have made. I asked him, with a better
  appearance of composure than I could have thought possible a minute
  before, whether he had made his feelings known to Agnes.
     " Oh, no, Master Copperfield ! " he returned ; " oh dear, no ! Not to
  any one but you. You see I am only just emerging from my lowly
  station. I rest a good deal of hope on her observing how useful I am to
  her father (for I trust to be very useful to him, indeed, Master Copperfield),
 and how I smooth the way for him, and keep him straight. She's so much
 attached to her father, Master Copperfield (oh what a lovely thing it is in a
 daughter !), that I think she may come, on his account, to be kind to me."
     I fathomed the depth of the rascal's whole scheme, and understood
 why he laid it bare.
     " If you '11 have the goodness to keep my secret, Master Copperfield,"

 he pursued, " and not, in general, to go against me, I shall take it as a
 particular favor. You wouldn't wish to make unpleasantness. I know
 what a friendly heart you 've got ; but having only known me on my umble
footing (on my umblest, I should say, for I am very umble still), you might,
 unbeknown, go against me rather, with my Agnes. I call her mine, you
 see, Master Copperfield. There 's a song that says, ' I 'd crowns resign,
 to call her mine !' I hope to do it, one of these days."
    Dear Agnes! So much too loving and too good for any one that
 I could think of, was it possible that she was reserved to be the wife of
 such a wretch as this !
     "There's no hurry at present, you know, Master Copperfield," Uriah
proceeded, in his slimy way, as I sat gazing at him, with this thought in
my mind. "My Agnes is very young still; and mother and me will have
to work our way upards, and make a good many new arrangements,
before it would be quite convenient. So I shall have time gradually to
make her familiar with my hopes, as opportunities offer. Oh, I'm so
much obliged to you for this confidence ! Oh, it's such a relief, you can't
think, to know that you understand our situation, and are certain (as you
wouldn't wish to make unpleasantness in the family) not to go against me ! "
    He took the hand which I dared not withhold, and having given it a
damp squeeze, referred to his pale-faced watch.
    "Dear me ! " he said, "it 's past one. The moments slip away so,
in the confidence of old times, Master Copperfield, that it's almost
half-past one ! "
    I answered that I had thought it was later. Not that I had really
thought so, but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered.
    " Dear me ! " he said, considering. " The ouse that I am stopping at-

a sort of a private hotel and boarding ouse, Master Copperfield, near the
New River ed-will have gone to bed these two hours."
    "I am sorry," I returned, "that there is only one bed here, and
that I-"
    " Oh, don't think of mentioning beds, &faster Copperfield ! " he rejoined

ecstatically, drawing up one leg. " But would you have any objections
to my laying down before the fire ? "
    " If it comes to that," I said, "pray take my bed, and I ' l l lie down
before the fire."
270           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    His repudiation of this offer was almost shrill enough, in the excess of
its surprise and humility, to have penetrated to the ears of Mrs. Crupp,
then sleeping, I suppose, in a dlstant chamber, situated at about the
level of low water mark, soothed in her slumbers by the ticking of an
incorrigible clock, to which she always referred me when we had any little
difference on the score of punctuality, and which was never less than
three quarters of an hour too slow, and had always been put right in the
morning by the best authorities. As no arguments I could urge, in my
bewildered condition, had the least effect upon his modesty in inducing
him to accept my bed-room, I was obliged to make the best arrangements
I could, for his repose before the fire. The mattress of the sofa (which
was a great deal too short for his lank figure), the sofa pillows, a blanket,
the table-cover, a clean breakfast-cloth, and a great coat, made him a bed
and covering, for which he was more than thankful. Having lent him a
nightcap, which he put on at once, and in which he made such an awful
figure that I have never worn one since, I left him t o his rest.
   I never shall forget that night. I never shall forget how I turned and
tumbled; how I wearied myself with thinking about Agnes and this
creature ; how I considered what could I do, and what ought I to do;
how I could come to no other conclusion than that the best course for
her peace, was to do nothing, and to keep to myself what I had heard.
If I went to sleep for a few moments, the image of Agnes with her
tender eyes, and of her father looking fondly on her, as I had so often
seen him look, arose before me with appealing faces, and filled me with
vague terrors. When I awoke, the recollection that Uriah was lying in
the next room sat heavy on me like a waking night-mare ; and oppressed
me with a leaden dread, as if I had had some meaner quality of devil for
a lodger.
   The poker got into my dozing thoughts besides, and wouldn't come out.
I thought, between sleeping and waking, that it was still red hot, and I
had snatched it out of the fire, and run him through the body. I was so
haunted at last by the idea, though I knew there was nothing in it, that
I stole into the next room to look at him. There I saw him, lying on his
back, with his legs extending to I don't know where, gurglings taking
place in his throat, stoppages in his nose, and his mouth open like a post-
office. He was so much worse in reality than in my distempered fancy,
that afterwards I was attracted to him in very repulsion, and could not
help wandering in and out every half hour or so, and taking another look
at him. Still, the long, long night seemed heavy and hopeless as ever,
and no promise of day was in the murky sky.
   When I saw him going down stairs early in the morning (for, thank
Heaven ! he would not stay to breakfast), it appeared to me as if the night
was going away in his person. When I went out to the Commons, I
charged Mrs. Crnpp with particular directions to leave the windows open,
that my sitting-room might be aired, and purged of his presence.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD




                           CHAPTER XXVI.
                        I FALL I N T O CAPTIVITY.

   I SAW no more of Uriah Heep, until the day when Agnes left town. I
was at the coach-office to take leave of her and see her go ; and there was
he, returning to Canterbury by the same conveyance. I t was some small
satisfaction to me to observe his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered,
mulberry-coloured great-coat perched up, in company with an umbrella
like a small tent, on the edge of the back seat on the roof, while Agnes
was, of course, inside ; but what I underwent in my efforts to be friendly
with him, while Agnes looked on, perhaps deserved that little recompense.
At the coach-window, as at the dinner-party, he hovered about us without
a moment's intermission, like a great vulture : gorging himself on every
syllable that I said to Agnes, or Agnes said to me.
   I n the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown
me, I had thought very much of the words Agnes had used in reference to
the partnership. "I did what I hope was right. Peeling sure that it
was necessary for papa's peace that the sacrifice should be made, I entreated
him to make it." A miserable foreboding that she would yield to, and
sustain herself by, the same feeling in reference to any sacrifice for his
sake, had oppressed me ever since. I knew how she loved him. I knew
what the devotion of her nature was. I knew from her own lips that she
regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors, and as owing him a
great debt she ardently desired to pay. I had no consolation in seeing
how different she was from this detestable Rufus with the mulberry-
coloured great-coat, for I felt that in the very difference between them, in
the self-denial of her pure soul and the sordid baseness of his, the greatest
danger lay. All this, doubtless, he knew thoroughly, and had, in his
cunning, considered well.
   Yet, I was so certain that the prospect of such a sacrifice afar off, must
destroy the happiness of Agnes ; and I was so sure, from her manner, of
its being unseen by her then, and having cast no shadow on her yet; that
I could as soon have injured her, as given her any warning of what
impended. Thus it was that we parted without explanation : she waving
her hand and smiling farewell from the coach-window; her evil genius
writhing on the roof, as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed.
   I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time.
When Agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival, I was as miserable as when
I saw her going away. Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state, this
subject was sure to present itself, and all my uneasiness was sure to be
redoubled. Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it. I t became
a part of my life, and as inseparable from my life as my own head.
   I had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness: for Steerforth was
at Oxford, as he wrote to me, and when I was not at the Commons, I was
very much alone. I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of
27 2          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

Steerforth. I wrote to him most affectionately in reply to his, but I think I
was glad, upon the whole, that he could not come to London just then. I
suspect the truth to be, that the influence of Agnes was upon me, undis-
turbed by the sight of him; and that it was the more powerful with me,
because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest.
    I n the meantime, days and weeks slipped away. I was articled to
Spenlow and Jorkins. I had ninety pounds a year (exclusive of my house-
rent and sundry collateral matters) from my aunt. My rooms were
engaged for twelve months certain : and though I still found them dreary
of an evening, and the evenings long, I could settle down into a state of
equable low spirits, and resign myself to coffee ; which I seem, on looking
back, to have taken by the gallon at about this period of my existence.
At about this time, too, I made three discoveries : first, that Mrs. Crupp
was a martyr to a curious disorder called " the spazzums," which was
generally accompanied with inflammation of the nose, and required to be
constantly treated with peppermint ; secondly, that something peculiar in
the temperature of my pantry, made the brandy-bottles burst ; thirdly, that
I was alone in the world, and much given to record that circnmstance in
fragments of English versification.
    On the day when I was articled, no festivity took place, beyond my
having sandwiches and sherry into the office for the clerks, and going alone
to the theatre at night. I went to see " The Stranger " as a Doctors'
Commons sort of play, and was so dreadfully cut up, that I hardly knew
myself in my own glass when I got home. Mr. Spenlow remarked, on
this occasion, when we concluded our business, that he should have been
happy to have seen me at his house at Norwood to celebrate our becoming
connected, but for his domestic arrangements being in some disorder, on
account of the expected return of his daughter from finishing her educa-
tion at Paris. But, he intimated that when she came home he should
hope to have the pleasure of entertaining me. I knew that he was a
widower with one daughter, and expressed my acknowledgments.
    Mr. Spenlow was as good as his word. I n a week or two, he referred
to this engagement, and said, that if I would do him the favor to come
 down next Saturday, and stay till Monday, he would be extremely happy.
Of course I said I would do him the favor; and he was to drive me down
in his phaeton, and to bring me back.
    When the day arrived, my very carpet-bag was an object of veneration to
the stipendiary clerks, to whom the house at Norwood was a sacred mystery.
 One of them informed me that he had heard that Mr. Spenlow ate entirely
 off plate and china ; and another hinted at champagne being constantly on
 draught, after the usual custom of table beer. The old clerk with the
wig, whose name was Mr. Tiffey, had been down on business several
times in the course of his career, and had on each occasion penetrated to
the breakfast-parlor. He described it as an apartment of the most
sumptuous nature, and said that he had drunk brown East India sherry
there, of a quality so precious as to make a man wink.
    We had an adjourned cause in the Consistory that day-about excom-
municating a baker who had been objecting in a vestry to a paving-rate-
and as the evidence was just twice the length of Eobinson Crusoe, accord-
ing to a calculation I made, it was rather late in the day before we
finished. However, we got him excommunicated for six weeks, and
                          OF DAVLD COPPERFIELD.                           273
  sentenced in no end of costs ; and then the baker's proctor, and the judge,
  and the advocates on both sides (who were all nearly related), went out of
  town together, and Mr. Spenlow and I drove away in the phaeton.
     The phaeton was a very handsome affair; the horses arched their
  necks and lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors'
  Commons. There was a good deal of competition in the Commons on all
  points of display, and it turned out some very choice equipages then; though
  I always have considered,and always shall consider, that in my time the great
 article of competition there was starch : which I think was worn among
 the proctors to as great an extent as it is in the nature of man to bear.
     We were very pleasant, going down, and Mr. Spenlow gave me some
 hints in reference to my profession. He said it was the genteelest
 profession in the world, and must on no account be confounded with the
 profession of a solicitor : being quite another sort of thing, infinitely
 more exclusive, less mechanical, and more profitable. We took things
 much more easily in the Commons than they could be taken anywhere
 else, he observed, and that set us, as a privileged class, apart. He
 said it was impossible to conceal the disagreeable fact, that we were
 chiefly employed by solicitors; but he gave me to understand that they
were an inferior race of men, universally looked down upon by all proctors
 of any pretensions.
     I asked Mr. Spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional
business ? He replied, that a good case of a disputed will, where there
was a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds, was, perhaps,
the best of all. I n such a case, he said, not only were there very pretty
pickings in the way of arguments at every stage of the proceedings, and
 mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory and counter-
 interrogatory (to say nothing of an appeal lying, first to the Delegates,
and then to the Lords); but, the costs being pretty sure to come out of
the estate at last, both sides went at it in a lively and spirited manner,
and expense was no consideration. Then, he launched into a general
 eulogium on the Commons. What was to be particularly admired (he
said) in the Commons, was its compactness. I t was the most conve-
niently organised place in the world. I t was the complete idea of snug-
ness. I t lay in a nut-shell. For example : You brought a divorce case,
or a restitution case, into the Consistory. Very good. You tried it in
the Consistory. You made a quiet little round game of it, among a
family group, and you played it out at leisure. Suppose you were not
satisfied with the Consistory, what did you do then? Why, you went
into the Arches. What was the Arches? The same court, in the same
room, with the same bar, and the same practitioners, but another judge,
for there the Consistory judge could plead any court-day as an advocate.
MTell, you played your round game out again. Still you were not
satisfied. Very good. What did you do then? Why, you went to the
Delegates. Who were the Delegates ? Why, the Eccles~asticalDelegates
were the advocates without any business, who had looked on at the
round game when it was playing in both courts, and had seen the cards
shuffled, and cut, and played, and had talked to all the players about it,
and now came fresh, as judges, to settle the matter to the satisfaction of
everybody ! Discontented people might talk of corruption in the Com-
mons, closeness in the Commons, and the necessity of reforming the
                                                                  T
274            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 Commons, said Mr. Spenlow solemnly, in conclusion ; but when the price of
wheat per bushel had been highest, the Commons had been busiest ; and a
man might lay his hand upon his heart, and say this to thewhole world,-
 " Touch the Commons, and down comes the country !"
    I listened to all this with attention ; and though, I must say, I had
my doubts whether the country was quite as much obliged to the Com-
mons as Mr. Spenlow made out, I respectfully deferred to his opinion.
That about the price of wheat per bushel, I modestly felt was too much
for my strength, and quite settled the question. I have never, to this
hour, got the better of that bushel of wheat. I t has re-appeared to
 annihilate me, all through my life, in connexion with all kinds of subjects.
 I don't know now, exactly, what it has to do with me, or what right
 it has to crush me, on an infinite variety of occasions ; but whenever I
 see my old friend the bushel brought in by the head and shoulders (as he
always is, I observe), I give up a subject for lost.
    This is a digression. I was not the man to touch the Commons, and
bring down the country. I submissively expressed, by my silence, my
acquiescence in all I had heard from my superior in years and knowledge ;
and we talked about "The Stranger" and the Drama, and the pair of
horses, until we came to Mr. Spenlow's gate.
    There was a lovely garden to Mr. Spenlow's house ; and though that was
not the best time of the year for seeing a garden, it was so beautifully kept,
that I was quite enchanted. There was a charming lawn, there were
clusters of trees, and there were perspective walks that I could just
distinguish in the dark, arched over with trellis-work, on which shrubs
and flowers grew in the growing season. " Here Miss Spenlow walks by
herself," I thought. " Dear me !"
    We went into the house, which was cheerfully lighted up, and into a
hall where there were all sorts of hats, caps, great-coats, plaids, gloves,
whips, and walking-sticks. "Where is Miss Dora?" said Mr. Spenlow to
the servant. " Dora ! " I thought. " What a beautiful name ! "
    We turned into a room near at hand (I think it was the identical
breakfast-room, made memorable by the brown East Indian Sherry), and
I heard a voice say, " Mr. Copperfield, my daughter Dora, and my
daughter Dora's confidential friend ! " I t was, no doubt, Mr. Spenlow's
voice, but I didn't know it, and I didn't care whose it was. All was
over in a moment. I had fulfilled my destiny. I was a captive and a
slave. I loved Dora Spenlow to distraction !
    She was more than human to me. She was a Fairy, a Sylph, I don't
know what she was-any thing that no one ever saw, and every thing that
every body ever wanted. I was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an
instant. There was no pausing on the brink ; no looking down, or looking
back; I was gone, headlong, before I had sense to say a word to her.
    " I,"observed a well-remembered voice, when I had bowed and mur-
mured something, " have seen Mr. Copperfield before."
    The speaker was not Dora. No; the confidential friend. Miss
Murdstone !
    I don't think I was much astonished. To the best of my judgment, no
capacity of astonishment was left in me. There was nothing worth
mentioning in the material world, but Dora Spenlow, to be astonished
about. I said, " How do you do, Miss Murdstone? I hope you are
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          275
  well." She answered, " Very well." I said, " How is Mr. Murdstone ? "
  She replied, " My brother is robust, I am obliged to you."
    $Zr. Spenlow, who, I suppose, had been surprised to see us recognise
  each other, then put in his word.
    " I am glad to find," he said, " Copperfield, that you and Miss Murd-

 stone are already acquainted."
    '' Mr. Copperfield and myself," said Miss Murdstone, wi.th severe
 composure, " are conncxions. We were once slightly acquainted. I t was
 in his childish days. Circumstances have separated us since. I should
 not have known him."
    I replied that I should have known her, any where. Which was true
 enough.
    " Miss Murdstone has had the goodness," said Mr. Spenlow to me, " to

 accept the office-if I may so describe it-of my daughter Dora's con-
 fidential friend. My daughter Dora having, unhappily, no mother, Miss
 Murdstone is obliging enough to become her companion and protector."
    Apassing thought occurred to me that Miss Murdstone, like the pocket
instrument called a life-preserver, was not so much designed for purposes
 of protection as of assault. But as I had none but passing thoughts for
 any subject save Dora, I glanced at her, directly afterwards, and was
 thinking that I saw, in her prettily pettish manner, that she was not
very much inclined to be particularly confidential to her companion and
protector, when a bell rang, which Mr. Spenlow said was the first dinuer-
bell, and so carried me off to dress.
    The idea of dressing one's self, or doing any thing in the way of action,
in that state of love, was a little too ridiculous. I could only sit down
before my fire, biting the key of my carpet-bag, and think of the capti-
vating, girlish, bright-eyed lovely Dora. What a form she had, what a
face she had, what a graceful, variable, enchanting manner !
    The bell rang again so soon that I made a mere scramble of my dress-
ing, instead of the careful operation I could have wished under the
circumstances, and went down-stairs. There was some company. Dora
was talking to an old gentleman with a grey head. Grey as he was-and
a great-grandfather into the bargain, for he said so-I was madly jealous
of him.
    What a state of mind I was in ! I was jealous of everybody. I couldn't
bear the idea of anybody knowing Mr. Spenlow better than I did. I t was
torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had
no share. When a most amiable person, with a highly polished bald
head, asked me across the dinner-table, if that were the first occasion of
my seeing the grounds, I could have done anything to him that was
savage and revengeful.
    I don't remember who was there, except Dora. I have not the least idea
what we had for dinner, besides Dora. My impression is, that I dined off
Dora, entirely, and sent away half-a-dozen plates untouched. I sat next
to her. I talked to her. She had the most delightful little voice, the
gayest little laugh, the pleasantest and most fascinating little ways, that
ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery. She was rather diminutive
altogether. So much the more precious, I thought.
    When she went out of the room with Miss Murdstone (no other ladies
were of the party), I fell into a reverie, only disturbed by the cruel appre-
                                                               T 2
27 6          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

hension that Miss Murdstone would disparage me to her. The amiable
creature with the polished head told me a long story, which I think was
about gardening. I think I heard him say, "my gardener," several times.
I seemed to pay the deepest attention to him, but I was wandering in a
garden of Eden all the while, with Dora.
   My apprehensions of being disparaged to the object of my engrossing
affection were revived when we went into the drawing-room, by the grim
and distant aspect of Miss Murdstone. But I was relieved of them in an
unexpected manner.
   '' David Copperfield," said Miss Murdstone, beckoning me aside into
a window. " A word."
   I confronted Miss Murdstone alone.
   " David Copperfield," said Miss Murdstone, "I need not enlarge up011

family circumstances. They are not a tempting subject."
   "Far from it, ma'am," I returned.
   " Far from it," assented Miss Murdstone. " I do not wish to revive the
memory of past differences, or of past outrages. I have received outrages
from a person-a female I am sorry to say, for the credit of my sex-
who is not to be mentioned without scorn and disgust; and therefore I
would rather not mention her."
   I felt very fiery on my aunt's account ; but I said it would certainly be
better, if Miss Murdstone pleased, not to mention her. I could not hear
her disrespectfully mentioned, I added, without expressing my opinion in a
decided tone.
   Miss Murdstone shut her eyes, and disdainfully inclined her head ; then,
slowly opening her eyes, resumed :
   "David Copperfield, I shall not attempt to disguise the fact, that I
formed an unfavorable opinion of you in your childhood. It may have
been a mistaken one, or you may have ceased to justify it. That is not
in question between us now. I belong to afamily remarkable, I believe,
for some firmness; and I am not the creature of circumstance or change.
I may have my opinion of you. You may have your opinion of me."
   I inclined my head, in my turn.
   "But it is not necessary," said Miss Murdstone, 'r that these opinions
should come into collision here. Under existing circumstances, it is as
well on all accounts that they should not. As the chances of life have
brought us together again, and may bring us together on other occasions,
I would say let us meet here as distant acquaintances. Family circum-
stances are a sufficient reason for our only meeting on that footing, and it
is quite unnecessary that either of us should make the other the subject of
remark. Do you approve of this?"
   "Miss Murdstone," I returned, "I think you and Mr. Murdstone used
me very cruelly, and treated my mother with great unkindness. I shall
always think so, as long as I live. But I quite agree in what you propose."
   Miss Murdstone shut her eyes again, and bent her head. Then, just
touching the back of my hand with the tips of her cold, stiff fingers, she
walked away, arranging the little fetters on her wrists and round her
neck: which seemed to be the same set, in exactly the same state, as
when I had seen her last. These reminded me, in reference to
 Miss Murdstone's nature, of the fetters over a jail-door; suggesting on
the outside, to all beholders, what was to be expected within.
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   All I know of the rest of the evening is, that I heard the empress of
my heart sing enchanted ballads in the French language, generally to the
effect that, whatever was the matter, we ought always to dance, Ta ra la,
Ta ra la! accompanying herself on a glorified instrument, resembling a
guitar. That I was lost in blissful delirium. That I refused refresh-
ment. That my soul recoiled from punch particularly. That when
Miss Murdstone took her into custody and led her away, she smiled and
gave me her delicious hand. That I caught a view of myself in a mirror,
looking perfectly imbecile and idiotic. That I retired to bed in a most
maudlin state of mind, and got up in a crisis of feeble infatuation.
    It was a fine morning, and early, and I thought I would go and take a
stroll down one of those wire-arched walks, and indulge my passion by
dwelling on her image. On my way through the hall, I encountered her
little dog, who was called Jip-short        for Gipsy. I approached him
tenderly, for I loved even him; but he showed his whole set of teeth,
got under a chair expressly to snarl, and wouldn't hear of the least
familiarity.
    The garden was cool and solitary. I walked about, wondering what
my feelings of happiness would be, if I could ever become engaged to this
dear wonder. As to marriage, and fortune, and all that, I believe I was
almost as innocently undesigning then, as when I loved little Em'ly. To
be allowed to call her "Dora," to write to her, to dote upon and worship
her, to have reason to think that when she was with other people she was
yet mindful of me, seemed to me the summit of human ambition-I am
sure it was the summit of mine. There is no doubt whatever that I was
 a lackadaisical young spooney; but there was a purity of heart in all this
still, that prevents my having quite a contemptuous recollection of it, let
me laugh as I may.
    I had not been walking long, when I turned a corner, and met her. I
 tingle again from head to foot as my recollection turns that corner, and
 my pen shakes in my hand.
     " You-are-out    early, Miss Spenlow," said I.
     "It's so stupid at home," she replied, "and Miss Murdstone is so
 absurd ! She talks such nonsense about its being necessary for the day
 to be aired, before I come out. Aired ! " (She laughed, here, in the
most melodious manner). " On a Sunday morning, when I don't practise,
 I must do something. So I told papa last night I maat come out.
 Besides, it's the brightest time of the whole day. Don't you think so? "
     I hazarded a bold flight, and said (not without stammering) that it was
 very bright to me then, though it had been very dark to me a minute before.
     " Do you mean a compliment?" said Dora, " or that the weather has
 really changed?"
     I stammered worse than before, in replying that I meant no com-
 pliment, but the plain truth; though I was not aware of any change
 having taken place in the weather. I t was in the state of my own feelings,
 I added bashfully : to clench the explanation.
     I never saw such curls-how could I, for there never were such curls!-
 as those she shook out to hide her blushes. As to the straw hat and blue
 ribbons which was on the top of the curls, if I could only have hung it
 up in my room in Buckingham Street, what a priceless possession it
 would have been !
278           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  " You have just   come home from Paris," said I.
  " Yes," said she. " Have you ever been there?"
  " No."
   " Oh ! I hope you'll go soon. You would like it so much !"
   Traces of deep-seated anguish appeared in my countenance. That she
should hope I would go, that she should think it possible I could go, was
insupportable. I depreciated Paris; I depreciated France. I said I
wouldn't leave England, under existing circumstances, for any earthly
consideration. Nothing should induce me. I n short, she was shaking
the curls again, when the little dog came running along the walk to our
relief.
   H e was mortally jealous of me, and persisted in barking at me. She
took him up in her arms-oh my goodness!-and caressed him, but he
insisted upon barking still. He wouldn't let me touch him, when I tried ;
and then she beat him. I t increased my sufferings greatly to see the pats
she gave him for punishment on the bridge of his blunt nose, while he winked
his eyes, and licked her hand, and still growled within himself like a little
double-bass. At length he was quiet-well he might be with her dimpled
chin upon his head !-and we walked away to look at a greenhouse.
   " You are not very intimate with Miss Murdstone, are you?" said
Dora.-" My pet ! "
   (The two last words were to the dog. Oh if they had only been to
me !)
   " No," I replied. " Not at all so."
    " She is a tiresome creature," said Dora pouting.        " I can't think
what papa can have been about, when he chose such a vexatious thing to
be my companion. Who wants a protector! I am sure I don't want a
protector. Jip can protect me a great deal better than Miss Murdstone,-
 can't you, Jip dear ? "
   He only winked lazily, when she kissed his ball of a head.
   " Papa calls her my confidential friend, but I am sure she is no such

thing-is she, Jip ? 'We are not going to confide in any such cross people,
Jip and I. We mea'n to bestow our confidence where we like, and to
find out our own friends, instead of having them found out for us-don't
we, Jip ? "
   Jip made a comfortable noise, in answer, a little like a tea-kettle when
it sings. As for me, every word was a new heap of fetters, rivetted
above the last.
   " I t is very hard, because we have not a kind Mama, that we are to
have, instead, a sulky, gloomy old thing like Miss Murdstone, always
following us about-isn't     it, Jip? Never mind, Jip. We won't be
confidential, and we'll make ourselves as happy as we can in spite of her,
and we'll teaze her, and not please her,-won't we, Jip ? "
   If it had lasted any longer, I think I must have gone down on my knees
on the gravel, with the probability before me of grazing them, and of
being presently ejected from the premises besides. But, by good fortune
the greenhouse was not far off, and these words brought us to it.
   I t contained quite a show of beautiful geraniums. We loitered along
in front of them, and Dora often stopped to admire this one or that one,
and I stopped to admire the same one, and Dora, laughing, held the dog up
childishly, to smell the flowers ; and if we were not all three in Fairyland,
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          279
certainly I was. The scent of a geranium leaf, at this day, strikes me
with a half comical half serious wonder as to what change has come over
me in a moment; and then I see a straw hat and blue ribbons, and a
quantity of curls, and a little black dog being held up, in two slender
arms, against a bank of blossoms and bright leaves.
   Miss Murdstone had been looking for us. She found us here; and
presented her uncongenial cheek, the little wrinkles in it filled with hair-
powder, to Dora to be kissed. Then she took Dora's arm in hers, and
marched us in to breakfast as if it were a soldier's funeral.
   How many cups of tea I drank, because Dora made it, I don't know.
But, I perfectly remember that I sat swilling tea until my whole nervous
system, if I had had any in those days, must have gone by the board.
By-and-by we went to church. Miss Murdstone was between Dora
and me in the pew ; but I heard her sing, and the congregation vanished.
A sermon was delivered-about Dora, of course-and I am afraid that is
all I know of the service.
   We had a quiet day. No company, a walk, a family dinner of four, and
an evening of looking over books and pictures; Miss Murdstone with
a homily before her, and her eye upon us, keeping guard vigilantly.
Ah! little did Mr. Spenlow imagine, when he sat opposite to me after
dinner that day, with his pocket-handkerchief over his head, how fervently
I was embracing him, in my fancy, as his son-in-law! Little did he think,
when I took leave of him at night, that he had just given his full consent to
my being engaged to Dora, and that I was invoking blessings on his head !
   We departed early in the morning, for we had a Salvage case coming on
in the Admiralty Court, requiring a rather accurate knowledge of the whole
science of navigation, in which (as we couldn't be expected to know much
about those matters in the Commons) the judge had entreated two old
Trinity Masters, for charity's sake, to come and help him out. Dora was
at the breakfast-table to make the tea again, however; and I had the
melancholy pleasure of taking off my hat to her in the phaeton, as she
stood on the door-step with Jip in her arms.
   What the Admiralty was to me that day ; what nonsense I made of our
case in my mind, as I listened to it ; how I saw DORA" engraved upon the
blade of the silver oar which they lay upon the table, as the emblem of
that high jurisdiction; and how I felt, when Mr. Spenlow went home
without me (I had had an insane hope that he might take me back again),
as if I were a mariner myself, and the ship to which I belonged had sailed
away and left me on a desert island ; I shall make no fruitless effort to
describe. If that sleepy old court could rouse itself, and present in any
visible form the day dreams I have had in it about Dora, it would reveal
my truth.
    I don't mean the dreams that I dreamed on that day alone, but day
after day, from week to week, and term to term. I went there, not to
attend to what was going on, but to think about Dora. If I ever bestowed
a thought upon the cases, as they dragged their slow length before me,
it was only to wonder, in the matrimonial cases (remembering Dora), how
it was that married people could ever be otherwise than happy; and,
in the Prerogative cases, to consider, if the money in question had been
left to me, what were the foremost steps I should immediately have
taken in regard to Dora. Within the first week of my passion, I
280           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 bought four sumptuous waistcoats -not for myself; I had no pride
 in them; for Dora-and        took to wearing straw-colored kid gloves in
 the streets, and laid the foundations of all the corns I have ever had.
 If the boots I wore at that period could only be produced and com-
 pared with the natural size of my feet, they would show what the state
 of my heart was, in a most affecting manner.
    And yet, wretched cripple as I made myself by this act of homage to
 Dora, I walked miles upon miles daily in the hope of seeing her. Not
 only was I soon as well known on the Norwood Road as the postmen on
 that beat, but I pervaded London likewise. I walked about the streets
 where the best shops for ladies were, I haunted the Bazaar like an unquiet
 spirit, I fagged through the Park again and again, long after I was
 quite knocked up. Sometimes, at long intervals and on rare occa-
 sions, I saw her. Perhaps I saw her glove waved in a carriage window ;
perhaps I met her, walked with her and Miss Murdstone a little way,
 and spoke to her. I n the latter case I was always very miserable after-
wards, to think that I had said nothing to the purpose ; or that she had no
idea of the extent of my devotion, or that she cared nothing about
me. I was always looking out, as may be supposed, for another in-
vitation to Mr. Spenlow's house. I was always being disappointed,
for I got none.
    Mrs. Crupp must have been a woman of penetration; for when this
 attachment was but a few weeks old, and I had not had the courage to
 write more explicitly even to Agnes, than that I had been to Mr. Spenlow's
 house, " whose family," I added, " consists of one daughter ;"-I say
 Mrs. Crupp must have been a woman of penetration, for, even in that
 early stage, she found it out. She came up to me one evening, when I
was very low, to ask (she being then afflicted with the disorder I have
mentioned) if I could oblige her with a little tincture of cardamums mixed
with rhubarb, and flavored with seven drops of the essence of cloves,
which was the best remedy for her complaint ;--or, if I had not such a
thing by me, with a little brandy, which was the next best. I t was not,
 she remarked, so palatable to her, but it was the next best. As I had
never even heard of the first remedy, and always had the second in the
closet, I gave Mrs. Crupp a glass of the second, which (that I might
have no suspicion of its being devoted to any improper use) she began to
take in my presence.
    " Cheer up, sir," said Mrs. Crupp, <'I can't abear to see you so, sir,
I'm a mother myself."
    I did not quite perceive the application of this fact to myself, but I
smiled on Mrs. Crupp, as benignly as was in my power.
    " Come, sir,"   said Mrs. Crupp. "Excuse me. I know what it is,
sir. There's a young lady in the case."
    " Mrs. Crupp ? " I returned, reddening.

    " Oh, bless you ! Keep a good heart, sir !" said Mrs. Crupp, noddin
encouragement. " Never say die, sir ! If She don't smile upon yo g
there's a many as will. You're a young gentleman to 6e smiled on.
Mr. Copperfull, and you must learn your walue, sir."
    Mrs. Crupp always called me Mr. Copperfull: firstly, no doubt,
because it was not my name; and secondly, I am inclined to think, in
some indistinct association with a washing-day.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           281
     "What makes you suppose there is any young lady in the case,
  Mrs. Crupp ? " said I.
     " Mr. ~ o ~ ~ e r f u l l said
                               , " Mrs. Crupp, with a great deal of feeling,
  " I 'm a mother myself."
    For some time Mrs. Crupp could only lay her hand upon her nankeen
 bosom, and fortify herself against returning pain with sips of her medicine.
 At length she spoke again.
     "When the present set were took for you by your dear aunt, Mr.
 Copperfull," said Mrs. Crupp, "my remark were, I had now found
 summun I could care for. ' Thank Ev'in ! ' were the expression, ' I have
 now found summun I can care for! '-You           don't eat enough, sir, nor
 yet drink."
    " Is that what you found your supposition on, Mrs. Crupp ? " said I.

    " Sir," said Mrs. Crupp, in a tone approaching to severity, " I 've laun-
 dressed other young gentlemen besides yourself. A young gentleman
 may be over-careful of himself, or he may be under-careful of himself. H e
 may brush his hair too regular, or too unregular. He may wear his boots
 much too large for him, or much too small. That is according as the
young gentleman has his original character formed. But let him go to
 which extreme he may, sir, there's a young lady in both of 'em."
    Mrs. Crupp shook her head in such a determined manner, that I had
 not an inch of 'vantage ground left.
    " I t was but the gentleman which died here before yourself," said
 Mrs Crupp, " that fell in love-with a barmaid-and had his waistcoats
 took in directly, though much swelled by drinking."
    " Mrs. Crupp," said I, " I must beg you not to connect the young lady
 in my case with a barmaid, or anything of that sort, if you please."
     " Mr. Copperfull," returned Mrs. Crupp, " I 'm a mother myself, and
 not likely. I ask your pardon, sir, if I intrude. I should never wish to
intrude where I were not welcome. But you are a young gentleman,
 Mr. Copperfull, and my adwice to you is, to cheer up, sir, to keep a good
heart, and to know your own walue. If you was to take to something,
sir," said Mrs. Crupp, "if you was to take to skittles, now, which is
healthy, you might find it divert your mind, and do you good."
    With these words, Mrs. Crupp, affecting to be very careful of the
brandy-which it was all gone-thanked me with a majestic curtsey,
and retired. As her figure disappeared into the gloom of the entry,
this counsel certainly presented itself to my mind in the light of a slight
liberty on Mrs. Crupp's part; but, at the same time, I was content to
receive it, in another point of view, as a word to the wise, and a warning
in future to keep my secret better.
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                          CHAPTER XXVII.
                            TOMMY TRADDLES.

    ITmay have been in consequence of Mrs. Crupp's advice, and, perhaps,
for no better reason than because there was a certain similarity in the
sound of the words skittles and Traddles, that it came into my head,
next day, to go and look after Traddles. The time he had mentioned was
more than out, and he lived in a little street near the Veterinary College
at Camden Town, which was principally tenanted, as one of our clerks
who lived in that direction informed me, by gentlemen students, who
bought live donkeys, and made experiments on those quadrupeds in their
private apartments. Having obtained from this clerk a direction to the
academic grove in question, I set out, the same afternoon, to visit my old
schoolfellow.
    I found that the street was not as desirable a one as I could have wished
it to be, for the sake of Traddles. The inhabitants appeared to have a
propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of, into the
road : which not only made it rank and sloppy, but untidy too, on account
of the cabbage-leaves. The refuse was not wholly vegetable either, for
I myself saw a shoe, a doubled-up saucepan, a black bonnet, and an
umbrella, in various stages of decomposition, as I was looking out for the
number I wanted.
    The general air of the place reminded me forcibly of the days when
I lived with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. An indescribable character of faded
gentility that attached to the house I sought, and made it unlike all the
 other houses in the street-though they were all built on one monotonous
pattern, and looked like the early copies of a blundering boy who was
learning to make houses, and had not yet got out of his cramped brick
and mortar pothooks-reminded me still more of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber.
Happening to arrive at the door as it was opened to the afternoon
milkman, I was reminded of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber more forcibly yet.
    " Now," said the milkman to a very youthful servant girl.           "Has
that there little bill of mine been heerd on? "
    "Oh master says he '11 attend to it immediate," was the reply.
    "Because," said the milkman, going on as if he had received no
answer, and speaking, as I judged from his tone, rather for the edification
of somebody within the house, than of the youthful servant-an impres-
sion which was strengthened by his manner of glaring down the passage-
 " Because that there little bill has been running so long, that I begin to
believe it's run away altogether, and never won't be heerd of. Now,
I ' m not a going to stand it, you know! " said the milkman, still
throwing his voice into the house, and glaring down the passage.
     As to his dealing in the mild article of milk, by-the-by, there never
 was a greater anomaly. His deportment would have been fierce in a
 butcher or a brandy merchant.
     The voice of the youthful servant became faint, but she seemed to me,
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            283
from the action of her lips, again to murmur that it would be attended
to immediate.
   " I tell you what," said the milkman, looking hard at her for the first
time, and taking her by the chin, "are you fond of milk? "
   '' Yes, I Likes it," she replied.
   " Good," said the milkman. " Then yon won't have none to-morrow.
D 'ye hear ? Not a fragment of milk you won't have to-morrow."
   I thought she seemed, upon the whole, relieved, by the prospect of
having any to-day. The milkman, after shaking his head at her, darkly,
released her chin, and with any thing rather than good will opened his
can, and deposited the usual quantity in the family jug. This done, he
went away, muttering, and uttered the cry of his trade next door, in a
vindictive shriek.
   " Does Mi. Traddles live here?"       I then enquired.
   A mysterious voice from the end of the passage replied "Yes." Upon
which the youthful servant replied " Yes."
   " I s he at home ?"    said I.
   Again the mysterious voice replied in the affirmative, and again the
servant echoed it. Upon this, 1 walked in, and in pursuance of the
servant's directions walked up-stairs ; conscious, as I passed the back
parlor-door, that I was surveyed by a mysterious eye, probably belonging
to the mysterious voice.
   When I got to the top of the stairs-the house was only a story high
above the ground floor-Traddles was on the landing to meet me. He
was delighted to see me, and gave me welcome, with great heartiness, to
his little room. I t was in the front of the house, and extremely neat,
though sparely furnished. I t was his only room, I saw; for there was a
sofa-bedstead in it, and his blacking-brushes and blacking were among
his books-on the top shelf, behind a dictionary. His table was covered
with papers, and he was hard at work in an old coat. I looked at nothing,
that I know of, but I saw everything, even to the prospect of a church
upon his china inkstand, as I sat down-and this, too, was a faculty con-
firmed in me in the old Micawber times. Various ingenious arrangements he
had made, for the disguise of his chest of drawers, and the accommodation
of his boots,his shaving-glass, and so forth, particularly impressed themselves
upon me, as evidences of the same Traddles who used to make models of
elephant's dens in writing paper to put flies in; and to comfort himself,
under ill usage, with the memorable works of art I have so often mentioned.
   I n a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large
white cloth. I could not make out what that was.
   " Traddles," said I , shaking hands with him again, after I had sat
down. " I am delighted to see you."
   " I am delighted to see you, Copperfield," he returned.         " I am very

glad indeed to see you. I t was because I was thoroughly glad to see you
when we met in Ely Place, and was sure you were thoroughly glad to see
me, that I gave you this address instead of my address at chambers."
   " Oh ! You have chambers ?"        said I.
   " Why, I have the fourth of a room and a passage, and the fourth of a
clerk," returned Traddles. " Three others and myself unite to have a set
of chambers-to         look business-like -and we quarter the clerk too.
Half-a-crown a week he costs me."
284            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    His old simple character and good temper, and something of his old
unlucky fortune also, I thought, smiled at me in the smile with which he
made this explanation.
    " I t 's not because I have the least pride, Copperfield, you understand,"
 said Traddles, " that I don't usually give my address here. It's only on
account of those who come to me, who might not like to come here.
For myself, I am fighting my way on in the world against difficulties,
and it would be ridiculous if I made a pretence of doing any thing else."
    " You are reading for the bar, Mr. waterbrook informed me? " said I.
    "Why, yes," said Traddles, rubbing his hands, slowly over one another,
" I am reading for the bar.      The fact is, I have just begun to keep my
terms, after rather a long delay. I t ' s some time since I was articled, but
the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull. A great pull! "
said Traddles, with a wince, as if he had had a tooth out.
    "Do you know what I can't help thinking of, Traddles, as I sit here
looking at you?" I asked him.
    " No," said he.
      That sky-blue suit you used to wear."
    "Lord, to be sure ! " cried Traddles, laughing. "Tight in the arms
and legs, you know ? Dear me ! Well ! Those were happy times, weren't
they ? "
    "I think our schoolmaster might have made them happier, without
doing any harm to any of us, I acknowledge," I returned.
    " Perhaps he might," said Traddles.       " But dear me, there was a good

deal of fun going on. Do you remember the nights in the bed-room?
When we used to have the suppers? And when you used to tell the
stories? Ha, ha, ha! And do you remember when I got caned for
crying about Mr. Mell? Old Creakle! I should like to see him again,
too ! "
    " He was a brute to you, Traddles," said I, indignantly ; for his good

humour made me feel as if I had seen him beaten but yesterday.
    " Do you think so ? " returned Traddles.       " Really ? Perhaps he was,

rather. But it's all over, a long while. Old Creakle ! "
    " You were brought up by an uncle, then?" said I.

   " Of course I was ! " said Traddles. The one I was always going to
write to. And always didn't, eh! Ha, ha, ha! Yes, I had an uncle then.
He died soon after I left school."
    " Indeed ! "

    "Yes. H e was a retired-what do you call it !-draper-cloth-mer-
chant -and had made me his heir. But he didn't like me when I
grew up."
    "Do you really mean that?" said I. H e was so composed, that I
fancied he must have some other meaning.
    " 0 dear yes, Copperfield ! I mean it," replied Traddles. " I t was an
unfortunate thing, but he didn't like me at all. H e said I wasn't at all
what he expected, and so he married his housekeeper."
    " And what did you do ? " I asked.
    "I didn't do anything in particular," said Traddles. "I lived with
them, waiting to be put out in the world, until his gout unfortunately
flew to his stomach-and so he died, and so she married a young man,
 and so I wasn't provided for."
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           285
   "Did you get nothing, Traddles, after all? "
   " Oh dear yes ! " said Traddles. " I got fifty pounds. I had never
been brought up to any profession, and at first I was at a loss what to do
for myself. However, I began, with the assistance of the son of a profes-
sional man, who had been to Salem House-Yawler, with his nose on one
side. Do you recollect him?"
   No. H e had not been there with me; all the noses were straight, in
my day.
   " I t don't matter," said Traddles.    " I began, by means of his assist-
ance, to copy law writings. That didn't answer very well; and then I
began to state cases for them, and make abstracts, and do that sort of
work. For I am a plodding kind of fellow, Copperfield, and had learnt
the way of doing such things pithily. Well ! That put it in my head to
enter myself as a law student ; and that ran away with all that was left of
the fifty pounds. Yawler recommended me to one or two other offices,
however-Mr. Waterbrook's for one-and I got a good many jobs. I
was fortunate enough, too, to become acquainted with a person in the
publishing way, who was getting up an Encyclopzdia, and he set me to
work; and, indeed" (glancing at his table), " I am at work for him at
this minute. I am not a bad compiler, Copperfield," said Traddles,
preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all he said, "but I have
no invention at all; not a particle. I suppose there never was a young
man with less originality than I have."
   As Traddles seemed to expect that I should assent to this as a matter
of course, I nodded ; and he went on, with the same sprightly patience-
I can find no better expression-as before.
    " So, by little and little, and not living high, 1managed to scrape up

the hundred pounds at last," said Traddles ; " and thank Heaven that's
paid-though it was-though it certainly was," said Traddles, wincing
again as if he had had another tooth out, " a pull. I am living by the sort
of work I have mentioned, still, and I hope, one of these days, to get con-
nected with some newspaper : which would almost be the making of my
fortune. Now, Copperfield, you are so exactly what you used to be, with
that agreeable face, and it's so pleasant to see you, that I sha'n't conceal
anything. Therefore you must know that I am engaged."
   Engaged ! Oh Dora !
   " She is a curate's daughter," said Traddles; " one of ten, down in
Devonshire. Yes !" For he saw me glance, involuntarily, at the prospect
on the inkstand. " That's the church ! You come round here, to the
left, out of this gate," tracing his finger along the inkstand, " and exactly
where I hold this pen, there stands the house-facing, you understand,
towards the church."
   The delight with which he entered into these particulars, did not
fully present itself to me until afterwards; for my selfish thoughts were
making a ground-plan of Mr. Spenlow's house and garden at the same
moment.
   " She is such a dear girl ! " said Traddles ; " a little older than me, but
the dearest girl ! I told you I was going out of town? I have been down
there. I walked there, and I walked back, and I had the most delightful
time ! I dare say ours is likely to be a rather long engagement, but
our motto is ' Wait and hope ! ' We always say that. 'Wait and hope,'
286           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

we always say. And she would wait, Copperfield, till she was sixty-any
age you can mention-for me ! "
    Traddles rose from his chair, and, with a triumphant smile, put his hand
upon the white cloth I had observed.
    " However," he said, " it's not that we haven't made a beginning

towards housekeeping. No, no; we have begun. We must get on by
degrees, but we have begun. Here," drawing the cloth off with great
pride and care, "are two pieces of furniture to commence with. This
flower-pot and stand, she bought herself. You put that in a parlor-
window," said Traddles, falling a little back from it to survey i t with the
greater admiration, " with a plant in it, and-and there you are ! This
little round table with the marble top (it's two feet ten in circumference),
I bought. You want to lay a book down, you know, or somebody comes
to see you or your wife, and wants a place to stand a cup of tea upon,
and-and there you are again ! " said Traddles. " I t ' s an admirable
piece of workmanship-firm as a rock ! "
   I praised them both, highly, and Traddles replaced the covering as
carefully as he had removed it.
    " I t ' s not a great deal towards the furnishing," said Traddles, " but

it's something. The table-cloths and pillow-cases, and articles of that
kind, are what discourage me most, Copperfield. So does the iron-
mongery-candle-boxes, and gridirons, and that sort of necessaries-
because those things tell, and mount up. However, ' wait and hope !'
And I assure you she's the dearest girl ! "
    " I am quite certain of it," said I.
    " In the mean time," said Traddles, coming back to his chair; " and
this is the end of my prosing about myself, I get on as well as I can. I
don't make much, but I don't spend much. I n general, I board with the
people down-stairs, who are very agreeable people indeed. Both Mr. and
Mrs. Micawber have seen a good deal of life, and are excellent company."
    <' My dear Traddles !" I quickly exclaimed. " What are you talking
about ! "
   Traddles looked at me, as if he wondered what I w a s talking about.
    " Mr. and Mrs. Micawber ! " I repeated. " Why, I am intimately
acquainted with them ! "
   An opportune double knock at the door, which I knew well from old
experience in Windsor Terrace, and which nobody but Mr. Micawber could
ever have knocked at that door, resolved any doubt in my mind as t o
their being my old friends. I begged Traddles to ask his landlord
to walk up. Traddles accordingly did so, over the bannister; and
Mr. Micawber, not a bit changed-his tights, his stick, his shirt-collar,
and his eye-glass, all the same as ever-came into the room with a genteel
and youthful air.
   " I beg your pardon, Mr. Traddles,"      said Mr. Micawber, with the old
roll in his voice, as he checked himself in humming a soft tune. " I was
not aware that there was any individual, alien to this tenement, in your
sanctum."
   Mr. Micawber slightly bowed to me, and pulled up his shirt-collar.
   "How do you do, Mr. Wcawber ? " said I.
   " Sir," said Mr. Micawber, " you are exceedingly obliging. I am ia
statu quo."
                         OF DAVID COPPEEFIELD.                          287
   "   And Mrs. Micawber ? " I pursued.
   "   Sir," said Mr. Micawber, " she is also, thank God, in statu quo."
     " And the children, Mr. Micawber ? "
     " Sir," said Mr. Micawber, " I rejoice to reply that they are, likewise,
 in the enjoyment of salubrity."
    All this time, Mr. Micawber had not known me in the least, though he
 had stood face to face with me. But, now, seeing me smile, he examined
 my features with more attention, fell back, cried, " I s it possible ! Have
 I the pleasure of again beholding Copperfield ! " and shook me by both
 hands with the utmost fervor.
     " Good Heaven, Mr. Traddles ! " saidMr. Micawber, "to think that I

 should find you acquainted with the friend of my youth, the companion of
 earlier days ! My dear! " calling over the bannisters to Mrs. Micawber,
 while Traddles looked (with reason) not a little amazed at this description
 of me. " Here is a gentleman in Mr. Traddles's apartment, whom he
 wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you, my love ! "
    Mr. Micawber immediately reappeared, and shook hands with me
 again.
     " And how is our good friend the Doctor, Copperfield? " said Mr. Mi-

 cawber, " and all the circle at Canterbury ? "
    " I have none but good accounts of them," said I.
    " I am most delighted to hear it," said Mr. Micawber. " I t was at
 Canterbury where we last met. Within the shadow, I may figuratively
 say, of that religious edifice, immortalized by Chaucer, which was anciently
 the resort of Pilgrims from the remotest corners of-in          short," said
 Mr. Micawber, "in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cathedral."
     I replied that it was. Mr. Micawber continued talking as volubly as
 he could; but not, I thought, without showing, by some marks of concern
 in his countenance, that he was sensible of sounds in the next room, as
 of Mrs. Micawber washing her hands, and hurriedly opening and shutting
 drawers that were uneasy in their action.
    "You find us, Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, with one eye on
 Traddles, "at present established, on what may be designated as a small and
unassuming scale; but, you are aware that I have, in the course of my career,
surmounted difficulties, and conquered obstacles. You are no stranger to
the fact, that there have been periods of my life, when it has been requisite
that I should pause, until certain expected events should turnup ; when it
has been necessary that I should fall back, before making what I trust I
shall not be accused of presumption in terming-a spring. The present
is one of those momentous stages in the life of man. You find me, fallen
back, for a spring; and I have every reason to believe that a vigorous
leap will shortly be the result."
    I was expressing my satisfaction, when Mrs. Micawber came in ; a
little more slatternly than she used to be, or so she seemed now, to my
unaccustomed eyes, but still with some preparation of herself for company,
and with a pair of brown gloves on.
    " My dear," said Mr. Micawber, leading her towards me. " Here is
a gentleman of the name of Copperfield, who wishes to renew his
acquaintance with you."
   I t would have been better, as it turned out, to have led gently up to
his announcement, for Mrs. Micawber, being in a delicate state of health,
288           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  was overcome by it, and was taken so unwell, that Mr. Micawber was
  obliged, in great trepidation, to run down to the water-butt in the
 back yard, and draw a basinful to lave her brow with. She presently
 revived, however, and was really pleased to see me. We had half-an-
 hour's talk, all together; and I asked her about the twins, who, she said,
 were " grown great creatures; " and after Master and Miss Micawber,
 whom she described as " absolute giants," but they were not produced
 on that occasion.
    Mr. Micawber was very anxious that I should stay to dinner. I
 should not have been averse to do so, but that I imagined I detected
 trouble, and calculation relative to the extent of the cold meat, in Mrs.
 Micawber's eye. I therefore pleaded another engagement ; and observing
 that Mrs. Micawber's spirits were immediately lightened, I resisted all
persuasion to forego it.
    But I told Traddles, and Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, that before I could
think of leaving, they must appoint a day when they would come and dine
with me. The occupations to which Traddles stood pledged, rendered it
necessary to fix a somewhat distant one ; but an appointment was made for
the purpose, that suited us all, and then I took my leave.
    Mr. Micawber, under pretence of showing me a nearer way than that by
which I had come, accompanied me to the corner of the street; being
anxious (he explained to me) to say a few words to an old friend, in
 confidence.
    " My dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, " I need hardly tell you
that to have beneath our roof, under existing circumstances, a mind like
that which gleams-if I may be allowed the expression-which gleams-
in your friend Traddles, is an unspeakable comfort. With a washerwoman,
who exposes hard-bake for sale in her parlor-window, dwelling next
 door, and a Bow-street officer residing over the way, you may imagine
that his society is a source of consolation to myself and to Mrs. Micawber.
I am at present, my dear Copperfield, engaged in the sale of corn upon
commission. I t is not an avocation of a remunerative description-in other
words it does aot pay-and some temporary embarrassments of a pecu-
niary nature have been the consequence. I am, however, delighted to add
that I have now an immediate prospect of something turning up (I am
not at liberty to say in what direction), which I. trust will enable me to
provide, permanently, both for myself and for your friend Traddles, in
whom I have an unaffected interest. You may, perhaps, be prepared to
hear that Mrs. Micawber is in a state of health which renders it not
wholly improbablethat an addition may be ultimately made to those pledges
of affection which-in short, to the infantine group. Mrs. Micawber's
family have been so good as to express their dissatisfaction with this state
of things. I have merely to observe, that I am not aware it is any
business of theirs, and that I repel that exhibition of feeling with scorn,
and with defiance ! "
    Mr. Micawber then shook hands with me again, and left me.

                          THE NILE BOAT;


Illustrated by Thirty$ve Steel Engravings and Maps, with numerous Cuts.
                            BY W. H. BARTLETT,
      AUTHOR OF "FORTY DAYS IN THE DESERT,"    "WALKS ABOUT JERUSALEM," ETC.




    EGYPT-the seat of the most ancient civilization known to us, the birth-place of
 art and science-has ever been regarded with peculiar interest, alike by the artist,
 the historian, the philosopher, and the student of sacred history. Accordingly,
 from the time of Herodotus to the present day, descriptions of the aspect of this
 singular country, the manners and customs of its population, and, above all, the
 wonderful monuments which attest its past magnificence, have ever been sought
 for and perused with avidity.
   The recent recovery by Champollion and others, of the key of hieroglyphic
 writing, constitutes a new era i n the study of Egyptian antiquities. Conjecture
 as to their origin and purpose has given place to solid and well-grounded fact.
 Their dates, and the names of their builders, are now revealed to us: a new light
has been thrown, not only upon the history of this great people, but also upon
that of contemporaneous nations, especially the Jews.
   Very numerous, i t must be confessed, are the publications that have been
 recently devoted to the subject; from the magnificent folios of Denon, Cham-
 pollion, and others, to the small duodecimo compiled for the information of
the million. The province of the volume announced is so far peculiar that it
aims a t affording a few distinct and lively impressions, by the combination of the
pencil and the pen, of the more interesting objects existing on the banks of the
Nile, accompanied by such a measure of historical and arch=ological explanation
as may inform the mind of the reader, without confusing him with redundant or
unintelligible details. Exaggeration has been studiously avoided, and accuracy
particularly studied. The Illustrations have been copied from original Sketches
taken on the spot, and engraved with conscientious fidelity.
   To those whose information about Egypt is as yet but slight, this volume, by
pointing out the prominent objects, may serve as an agreeable introduction to
more serious researches ; while to others, who have neither time nor inclination
to go deeply into the subject, i t may supply, in a brief and popular shape, those
general results which could only be obtained from the perusal of voluminous and
costly publications.

A JOURNEY FROM CAIRO BY WADY F E I R A N TO M O U N T SINAI
                    AND PETRA.
   The object of this volume is to give distinct and graphic pen and pencil
sketches of the Route of the Israelites from Egypt to Mount Sinai, dwelling par-
ticularly upon the beautiful oasis of


pronounced by Lepsius and other savans to be the real Sinai. The work also
embraces notices of the Convent of St. Catherine, Mount Hor, and the extra-
ordinary city of Petra.
  The Illustrations have all been drawn upon the spot, with every attention to
accuracy. The interest of the subject, though much has been written upon it, is,
perhaps, on the increase, fresh light having been obtained by recent researches.
In a pictorial point of view, it is full of interesting materials. The halting-places
of the Israelites, the mountain of the law-giving, the coasts of the Red Sea, the
wonderful rock scenery and excavated temples and tombs of Petra, combine to
present a wild and singular variety of illustration.

   The Authors have laboured with zeal and industry to obtain such topographical
and statistical information as may be useful to those who visit Ireland, or who
desire the means of judging correctly as to its capabilities and condition. But
their especial duty has been to associate with more important details such inci-
dents, descriptions, legends, traditions, and personal sketches, as may excite
interest i n those who might be deterred from the perusal of mere facts, if com-
municated in a less popular form. Independently of their own actual observation
and experience, they have had the aid of many who have continually employed
the pen or pencil-or     both-in collecting and preserving records that serve to
throw light on the state of the country and the character of its people; and they
have obtained the co-operation of others who are interested, with them, i n making
Ireland more advantageously known to England, and who have confidence i n the
Authors' competency for the due discharge of their important task.

    THE CASTLES AND ABBEYS OF ENGLAND.

      "Switzerland Illustrated," &c. kc. I n one vol. imperial 8vo. price 11. 5s.
   This work presents Engravings of whatever is most interesting or least known
i n the Scenery, Style, or Decoration of each subject, and is embellished with
Vignette specimens of the Castles, Abbeys, Cathedrals, Chapels, Tombs, Altars,
Halls, Galleries, Armouries, Portraits and Medallions, Sculptures, Arches, Gate-
ways, Antique Furniture and Inscriptions, Statues and fragments of Art, Festive,
Military, and Rural Scenes, Battle-fields, Banquet Halls, National Sports and
Athletic Games, and whatever illustrates most forcibly the minds, habits, and

                            THE RHINE BOOK:
      Embracing the Scenery of the River, and its Historical and Legendary
                                     Associations.
                              By FRED. KNIGHTHUNT.
   THE RHINEBOOK,by a n arrangement entirely novel, seeks to separate the
romance of travel from its common-place, h'umerous illustrations from original
sketches, and all the attractions of the finest printing, render the volume worthy
of the library, the drawing-room, or the boudoir, whilst i t unites with its claims
to elegance those points of practical usefulness necessary i n a Guide Book. Dates,
distances, times, and prices, are fully and exactly stated, to enable the Tourist to
know and regulate his expenses at pleasure, and to avoid those extortions to
which, when destitute of such information, he would most certainly be subject.

abound i n the nooks of " Merry England."

   "From Mullen, famed for its mineral springs, to the bay of Youghal, flows the Blackwater-
a river which, in point of varied and beaut~ful scenery, may stand comparison with almost any
on the Continent. I t is the course of this noble stream-the picturesque and luxuriant soil
through which it glides-a soil teeming with the richest treasures, but less fostered by art than
any other within the British Islands-that Mr.O'Flanagan has made the subject of the present
very elegant work."-Dublin Euening Post.

    occasion favourable for New Subscribers to the ART-JOURNAL
            the commencemevt of a New FTolume with the New Year.


   To the atelier of the ARTIST  ; to the library of the AHATEUR;     to the desk of the
STUDENT;     to the workshop of the MANUFACTURER;       and to the drawingroom table
of the ADMIRER      OF BEAUTIFUL  ENGRAYINGS,   the ART-JOURNAL     is recommended as
" a companion and counsellor, at once agreeable and instructive; " as "ably and

impartially conducted;" as "stimulating the manufacturer to the production of
excellence, and the public to appreciate his improved works;" and as having
worked out with "industry, integrity, and ability," its high purpose of "supplying
to Artists, Amateurs, and Connoisseurs, accurate and useful information upon all
subjects in which they are interested, and to the public the means of justly ascer-
taining and estimating the progress of Art both at home and abroad."
   With the year 1849 commenced the issue in the ART-JOURNAL               of B series of
Prints of the highest order of merit, engraved in the Line manner by the most
eminent British Engravers. These consist of THE VERNON          GALLERY    (each Monthly
Part containing two examples), the permission to engraxre which was accorded to
the Editor by the late ROBERT    VERNON,   Esq. previous to his "proffer" of the collec-
tion to the Nation-a permission graciously sanctioned and confirmed by the
Trustees of the National Gallery. "To the British School of Art the publication
has been a boon of magnitude ;" "Mr. VERNON'S         gift is thus made doubly the pro-
perty of the people;" "rendering ample justice to the best works of the best Artists
of our country," and "aiding the progress of national improvement, by rendering
accessible to all classes a source of enjoyment and instruction."
   To these testimonials may be added that of Mr. VERNON,         who characterised the
Engravings as " most beautifully executed," and "trusted that when published in
the ART-JOURNAL      they would be appreciated by the Public, and, by their diffusion
at so moderate a cost, improve and increase the taste for the productions of our
Native Artists."
   I t is not therefore too much to assume that the ART-JOURNAL      is a National Work,
aiding the great cause of National Improvement.
   The Volume, handsomely bound, of the ART-JOURNAL             for the year 1849, con-
taining Twenty-five Line Engravings (on Steel) of the Vernon Gallery, Twelve
Engravings (on Steel) of Worlcs in Sculpture, above Eight Hundred Engravings
on Wood, and Four Hundred Pages of Letter-press, may be purchased for the sum
of THIRTY-ONE      SHILLINGS and SIXPENCE.A few years ago Ten Shillings was the

   Of these each Monthly Part, as heretofore, will contain TWO, together with one
work in Sculpture,-original and from some famous British work,-and, usually,
about Fifty Engravings on Wood,-comprising portraits of British Painters and
Sculptors; Passages from the Poets, examples of the genius and fancy of many
eminent artists; models of antique beauty; original designs for manufactures;
examples of meritorious objects in manufactured Art, actually executed; and
selcctions from the most useful models or finest works produced in the principal
cities of the Continent.
   The letter-press is contributed by many of the most eminent writers upon Art
in England and of the Continent. The large circulation of the Journal enables the
Editor to obtain the best assistance of the pen as of the pencil, so as to exhibit the
results of knowledge and experience, and the practicability of improvements, in
all matters essential to the Artist, instructive to the Amateur, profitable to the
Manufacturer, and interesting to the Public.

  I n order to meet the wishes of those who require copies of the Engravings, for
the portfolio or for framing, it has been resolved to issue A LrmrTEn NUKBER OF
PROOJS, AND IMPRESSIONS on large paper; for these early application will be neces-
sary, as they will be taken onlyfor Subscribers.

THE Copyright of the above most popular Work of the most popular
Author of the day having recently changed hands, the present Proprietors
deem it expedient to offer a few remarks relative to its re-publication.
      The Work was originally published at One Guinea and a Half. At
$hisprice, its circulation, although large, was, necessarily, confined to the
more wealthy classes. I t is now purposed to re-issue the Work in Parts,
at a price which will render it available to all.
      AS a proof of the estimation in which the Work was held, by both
Author and Publisher, an enormous expence was incurred in illustrating it
in the best style of the age, and the late Mr. CHARLES         HEATH,whose
successful efforts in the best Annuals ever published in this country, " The
Book of Beauty," and a The Keepsake," was fixed upon to superintend
the execution of this important department. The Designs are principally
by CORBOULD,    STEPHANOFF,     and KENNYMEADOWS.
      The Work will comprise Eight Monthly Parts, at One Shilling each,
each Part to contain Two Illustrations, and the last an highly-finished
Portrait of the Author ; thus placing within the reach of the Public, for
Eight S h i i i , a Book which must form a gem in the library of every
possessor.

                                    JANUARY.
   THEREis no month in the year when Winter has such entire sway as January. I t is termed by some
" the very hole of winter," and justly so, too. I t is then that the fanciful fret-work is seen to deaden and
decorate the window-panes, while Jack Frost, with his icy fingers, pencils his sketches. I t is in January
that all around is sad, gloomy and lifeless. Not a crocus is seen to show its early blossom, and not a
primrose sparkles in the eye. The very hyacinths in the windows seem fearful of showing anything but
their pendant roots.
   The evenings are cold, long and dreary ;and but for the prevailing festivities, there would be nothing to
comfortnothing to cheer. The balls and evening parties, however, with other rational entertainments,
do much to alleviate and enliven in this month.
   E. MOSESAND SONhave taken occasion to touch upon this month, in order to call attention to
those Winter articles, so essential for various purposes at this season of the year. For the inclemency of
the month E. Moses & SONhave warm and elegant Paletots in every variety.
   For the entertainments of the month the proprietors have fancy vests, coats, trousers, &c., as various
and numerous as a purchaser could wish to select from. E. MOSES& SONare confident that an inspection
will convince the reader of the immense superiority of their Winter articles over those of any other
House in the Trade ; and, consequently, they earnestly solicit the same at the earliest opportnnity.

              EDITED BY DR. LINDLEY AND JOSEPH PAXTON.

  N D I L L U S T R A T E D BY H I G H L Y F I N I S H E D PLATES AND WOODCUTS.



    Thiswork, for which Monsieur CONSTANS,      a French Botanical Draughtsman of great taste and skill,
and a pupil of Mons. Decaisne, has been expressly engaged, will be confined to the proper business of
an illustrated book, namely the representation and description of all newplants which may appear
i n gardens. The species which are of most importance will be illustrated by coloured plates, one
  species or genus only to a plate, with a leaf or more of letter-press, explaining the principal
 scientific and horticultural facts which belong to each plant. The species of less importance will
be treated of more briefly, and will be illustrated when necessary by copious woodcuts and
vignettes. The object, in short, will be to combine Scientific Botany with Gardening, and exact
  delineations of plants with pictorial effect. I t is believed that by such means this periodical will
not only be indispensable to the BOTANIST     and GARDENER,    but be also amine of invaluable hints by
which the ARTISTand MANUFACTURER           will be able to profit.

   I t is not intended to admit any other kind of matter than such as is now described. All special
treatises on cultivation, and all disquisitions respecting subjects incidental to gardening will be
transferred to the Gardeners' Chronicle and similar periodicals, in which there is ample space for
such discussions, and to which they have now become better adapted than to a pictorial work.

                           CHAPTER XXVIII.

    UNTILthe day arrived on which I was to entertain my newly-found old
 friends, I lived principally on Dora and coffee. I n my love-lorn condition,
 my appetite languished ; and I was glad of it, for I felt as though it would
 have been an act of perfidy towards Dora to have a natural relish for my
 dinner. The quantity of walking exercise I took, was not in this respect
 attended with its usual consequence, as the disappointment counteracted the
 fresh air. I have my doubts, too, founded on the acute experience acquired
a t this period of my life, whether a sound enjoyment of animal food can
 develop itself freely in any human subject who is always in torment from
tight boots. I think the extremities require to be at peace before the
stomach will conduct itself with vigour.
    On the occasion of this domestic little party, I did not repeat my former
 extensive preparations. I merely provided a pair of soles, a small leg of
 mutton, and a pigeon-pie. Mrs. Crupp broke out into rebellion on my
 first bashful hint in reference to the cooking of the fish and joint, and said,
 with a dignified sense of injury, " No ! No, sir ! You will not ask me
 sich a thing, for you are better acquainted with me than to suppose me
 capable of doing what I cannot do with ampial satisfaction to my own
 feelings!" But, in the end, a compromise was effected ; and Mrs. Crupp
 consented to achieve this feat, on condition that I dined from home for a
fortnight afterwards.
    And here I may remark, that what I underwent from Mrs. Crupp, in
consequence of the tyranny she established over me, was dreadful. I
never was so much afraid of any one. We made a compromise of every-
thing. If I hesitated, she was taken with that wonderful disorder which
was always lying in ambush in her system, ready, at the shortest notice,
to prey upon her vitals. If I rang the bell impatiently, after half-a-dozen
unavailing modest pulls, and she appeared at last-which was not by
any means to be relied upon-she would appear with a reproachful aspect,
sink breathless on a chair near the door, lay her hand upon her nankeen
bosom, and become so ill, that I was glad, at any sacrifice of brandy or
anything else, to get rid of her. If I objected to having my bed made at
five o'clock in the afternoon-which I do still think an uncomfortable
arrangement-one motion of her hand towards the same nankeen region
of wounded sensibility was enough to make me falter an apology. I n
short, I would have done anything in an honorable way rather than give
BIrs. Crupp offence; and she was the terror of my life.
    I bought a second-hand dumb-waiter for this dinner-party, in prefer-
ence to re-engaging the handy young man ; against whom I had conceived a
prejudice, in consequence of meeting him in the Strand, one Sunday
morning, in a waistcoat remaskably like one of mine, which had been miss-
                                                                  U
290             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

ing since the former occasion. The "young gal " was re-engaged; but on
the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes, and then withdraw
to the landing-place, beyond the outer door ; where a habit of sniffing she
had contracted would be lost upon the guests, and where her retiring on
the plates would be a physical impossibility.
    Having laid in the materials for a bowl of punch, to be compounded
by Mr. Micawber ; having provided a bottle of lavender-water, two
wax candles, a paper of mixed pins, and a pincushion, to assist Mrs.
Micawber in her toilette, at my dressing-table; having also caused the
fire in my bed-room to be lighted for Mrs. Micawber's convenience ; and
having laid the cloth with my own hands, I awaited the result with
composure.
   At the appointed time, my three visitors arrived together. Mr. Micaw-
ber with more shirt-collar than usual, and a new ribbon to his eye-glass ;
Mrs. Micawber with her cap in a whitey-brown paper parcel; Traddles
carrying the parcel, and supporting Mrs. Micawber on his arm. They
were all delighted with my residence. When I conducted Mrs. Micawber
to my dressing-table, and she saw the scale on which it was prepared for
her, she was in such raptures, that she called Mr. Micawber to come in
and look.
    " My dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, " this is luxurious. This
is a way of life which reminds me of the period when I was myself
in a state of celibacy, and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been solicited to
plight her faith at the Hymeneal altar."
    " He means, solicited by him, Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber

 archly. " He cannot answer for others."
    " My dear," returned Mr. Micawber with sudden seriousness, " I have
 no desire to answer for others. I am too well aware that when, in the
 inscrutable decrees of Fate, you were reserved for me, it is possible you
 may have been reserved for one, destined, after a protracted struggle, at
 length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a complicated nature.
 I understand your allusion, my love. I regret it, but I can bear it."
    " Micawber !" exclaimed Mrs. Micawber, in tears. " Have I deserved
 this ! I, who never have deserted you; who never will desert you,
Micawber ! "
    "My love," said Mr. Micawber, much affected, " you will forgive, and
 our old and tried friend Copperfield will, I am sure, forgive, the momentary
laceration of a wounded spirit, made sensitive by a recent collision with
 the Minion of Power-in       other words, with a ribald Turncock attached
to the water-works-and will pity, not condemn, its excesses."
    Mr. Micawber then embraced Mrs. Micawber, and pressed my hand;
lea~ringme to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply
 of water had been cut off that afternoon, in consequence of default in the
payment of the company's rates.
    To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject, I informed Mr.
 Micawber that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch, and led him to the
 lemons. Hi? recent despondency, not to say despair, was gone in a
 moment. I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the
 fragrance of lemon-peel and sugar, the odor of burning rum, and the
 steam of boiling water, as Mr. Micawber did that afternoon. I t was
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           291
wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicate
fumes, as he stirred, and mixed, and tasted, and looked as if he were
making, instead of punch, a fortune for his family down to the latest
posterity. As to Mrs. Micawber, I don't know whether it was the
effect of the cap, or the lavender-water, or the pins, or the fire, or the
wax candles, but she came out of my room, comparatively speaking,
lovely. And the lark was never gayer than that excellent woman.
    I suppose-I never ventured to inquire, but I suppose-that Mrs.
Crupp, after frying the soles, was taken ill. Because we broke down at
that point. The leg of mutton came up very red within, and very pale
without : besides having a foreign substance of a gritty nature sprinkled
over it, as if it had had a fall into the ashes of that remarkable kitchen
fire-place. But we were not in a condition to judge of this fact from the
appearance of the gravy, forasmuch as the "young gal " had dropped it all
uponthe stairs-where it remained, by-the-by, in a long train, until it was
worn out. The pigeon-pie was not bad, but it was a delusive pie : the
crust being like a disappointing head, phrenologically speaking : full of
lumps and bumps, with nothing particular underneath, I n short, the
banquet was such a failure that I should have been quite unhappy-about
the failure, I mean, for I was always unhappy about Dora-if I had not
been relieved by the great good-humour of my company, and by a bright
suggestion from Mr. Micawber.
    " My dear friend Copperfield,"      said Mr. Micawber, "accidents will
occur in the best regulated families ; and in families not regulated by that
pervading influence which sanctifies while it enhances the-a-I    would say,
in short, by the influence of Woman, in the lofty character of Wife, they
may be expected with confidence, and must be borne with philosophy. If
you will allow me to take the liberty of remarking that there are few
comestibles better, in their way, than a Devil, and that I believe, with a
little division of labor, we could accomplish a good one if the young
person in attendance could produce a gridiron, I would put it to you, that
this little misfortune may be easily repaired."
    There was a gridiron in the pantry, on which my morning rasher of
bacon was cooked. We had it in, in a twinkling, and immediately applied
ourselves to carrying Mr. Micawber's idea into effect. The division of
labor to which he had referred was this :-Traddles cut the mutton into
slices ; Mr. Micawber (who could do anything of this sort to perfection)
covered them with pepper, mustard, salt, and cayenne ; I put them on the
gridiron, turned them with a fork, and took them off, under Mr. Micawber's
directions ; and Mrs. Micawber heated, and continually stirred, some
mushroom ketchup in a little saucepan. When we had slices enough done
to begin upon, we fell-to, with our sleeves still tucked up at the wrists,
more slices sputtering and blazing on the fire, and our attention divided
between the mutton on our plates, and the mutton then preparing.
    What with the novelty of this cookery, the excellence of it, the bustle
of it, the frequent starting up to look after it, the frequent sitting down
to dispose of it as the crisp slices came off the gridiron hot and hot, the
being so busy, so flushed with the fire, so amused, and in the midst of
such a tempting noise and savor, we reduced the leg of mutton to the
bone. My own appetite came back miraculousiy. I am ashamed to
                                                               u2
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AiiD EXPERIENCE

record it, but I really believe I forgot Dora for a little while. I am satisfied
that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber could not have enjoyed the feast more if
they had sold a bed to provide it. Traddles laughed as heartily, almost the
whole time, as he ate and worked. Indeed we all did, all at once ; and I
dare say there never was a greater success.
    We were at the height of our enjoyment, and were all busily engaged,
in our several departments, endeavouring to bring the last batch of slices
to a state of perfection that should crown the feast, when I was aware of
a strange presence in the room, and my eyes encountered those of the staid
Littimer, standing hat in hand before me.
    " What 's the matter ! " I involuntarily asked.

       I beg your pardon, sir, I was directed to come in. I s my master not
here, sir ? "
    " No."

    r' Have you not seen him, sir? "
    " No ; don't you come from him ? "
    "Not immediately so, sir."
    <'Did he tell you you would find him here ? "
    " Not exactly so, sir.   But I should think he might be here to-morrow,
 as he has not been here to-day."
    " I s he coming up from Oxford? "

    " I beg, sir," he returned respectfully, 'cthat you will be seated, and
 allow me to do this." With which he took the fork from my unresisting
                             -
 hand, and bent over the gridiron,     as if his whole attention were concen-
 trated on it.
    We should not have been much discomposed, I dare say, by the appear-
 ance of Steerforth himself, but we became in a moment the meekest of
 the meek before his respectable serving-man. Mr. Micawber, humming
 a tune, to show that he was quite at ease, subsided into his chair, with the
 handle of a hastily-concealed fork sticking out of the bosom of his coat, as
 if he had stabbed himself. Mrs. Micawber put on her brown gloves, and
 assumed a genteel languor. Traddles ran his greasy hands through his
 hair, and stood it bolt upright, and stared in confusion at the table-cloth.
 As for me, I was a mere infant at the head of my own table ; and hardly
 ventured to dance at the resoectable ohenomenon. who had come from
              0
 Heaven knows where, to put my establishment to rights.
     Meanwhile he took the mutton off the gridiron, and gravely handed it
 round. We all took some, but our appreciation of it was gone, and we
 merely made a show of eating it. As we severally pushed away our plates,
 he noiselessly removed them, and set on the cheese. He took that off,
 too, when it was done with ; cleared the table ; piled everything on the
 dumb-waiter ; gave us our wine-glasses ; and, of his own accord, wheeled
 the dumb-waiter into the pantry. All this was done in a perfect manner,
  and he never raised his eyes from what he was about. Yet, his very
  elbows, when he had his back towards me, seemed to teem with the
  expression of his fixed opinion that I was extremely young.
      " Can I do anything more, sir ? "
     I thanked him and said, No ; but would he take no dinner himself?
      "None, I am obliged to you, sir."
        Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford ? "
                         OF DAVID COPPERBIELD.

  " I beg your pardon,     sir ? "
  "   I s Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford? "
   "I should imagine that he might be here to-morrow, sir. I rather
thought he might have been here to-day, sir. The mistake is mine, no
doubt, sir."
   "If you should see him first-" said I.
   " If you '11 excuse me, sir, I don't think I shall see him first."
   " I n case you do," said I, "pray say that I am sorry he was not here
to-day, as an old schoolfellow of his was here."
   "Indeed, sir ! " and he divided a bow between me and Traddles, with
a glance at the latter.
   He was moving softly to the door, when, in a forlorn hope of saying
something naturally-which I never could, to this man-I said :
   " Oh ! Littimer ! "
      Sir ! "
   "Did you remain long at Yarmouth, that time? "
   " Not particularly so, sir."
   " You saw the boat completed ? "
   " Yes, sir. I remained behind on purpose to see the boat completed."
   " I know ! "     He raised his eyes to mine respectfully. " Mr. Steerforth
has not seen it yet, I suppose? "
   "I really can't say, sir. I think-but I really can't say, sir. I wish
you good night, sir."
   H e comprehended everybody present,in the respectful bow with which he
followed these words, and disappeared. My visitors seemed to breathe
more freely when he was gone; but my own relief was very great, for
besides the constraint, arising from that extraordinary sense of being at a
disadvantage which I always had in this man's presence, my conscience
had embarrassed me with whispers that I had mistrusted his master, and
I could not repress a vague uneasy dread that he might find it out. How
was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always did feel as if
this man were finding me out?
   Mr. Micawber roused me from this reflection, which was blended with
a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing Steerforth himself, by bestow-
ing many encomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable fellow,
and a thoroughly admirable servant. Mr. Micawber, I may remark, had
taken his full share of the general bow, and had received it with infinite
condescension.
   "But punch, my dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, tasting it,
" like time and tide, waits for no man.     Ah ! it is at the present moment
in high flavor. My love, will you give me your opinion? "
   Mrs. Micawber pronounced it excellent.
   " Then I will drink," said Mr. Micawber, " if my friend Copperfield
will permit me to take that social liberty, to the days when my friend
Copperfield and myself were younger, and fought our way in the world
side by side. I may say, of myself and Copperfield, in words we have
sung together before now, that
                       We twa' hae run about the braes
                       And pn'd the gowans fine
294            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

-in a figurative point of view-on several occasions. I am not exactly
aware," said Mr. Micawber, with the old roll in his voice, and the old
indescribable air of saying something genteel, " what gowans may be, but
I have no doubt that Copperfield and myself would frequently have taken
a pull at them, if it had been feasible."
    Mr. Micawber, at the then present moment, took a pull at his punch. So
we all did : Traddles evidently lost in wondering at what distant time
3fr. Micawber and I could possibly have been comrades in the battle of
the world.
    'r Ahem ! " said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat, and warming with
the punch and with the fire. " My dear, another glass ? "
    Mrs. Micawber said it must be very little, but we couldn't allow that,
so it was a glassful.
    " As we are quite confidential here, Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs.
Micawber, sipping her punch, "Mr. Traddles being a part of our domes-
ticity, I should much like to have your opinion on Mr. Micawber's prospects.
For corn," said Mrs. Micawber argumentatively, "as I have repeatedly
said to Mr. Micawber, may be gentlemanly, but it is not remunerative.
Commission to the extent of two and nine~encein a fortnight         "   cannot,
however limited our ideas. be considered remunerative."
    We were all agreed upon that.
     " Then," said Mrs. Micawber, who prided herself on taking a clear view
 of things, and keeping Mr. Micawber straight by her woman's wisdom,
 when he might otherwise go a little crooked, " then I ask myself this
 question. If corn is not to be relied upon, what i s ? Are coals to be
 relied upon ? Not at all. We have turned our attention to that experi-
 ment, on the suggestion of my family, and we find it fallacious."
     Mr. Micawber, leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets,
 eyed us aside, and nodded his head, as much as to say that the case was very
 clearly put.
     r c The articles of corn and coals," said Mrs. Micawber, still more argu-
 mentatively, "being equally out of the question, Mr. Copperfield, I
 naturally look round the world, and say, ' What is there in which a person
 of Mr. Micawber's talent is likely to succeed? ' And I exclude the doing
 anything on commission, because commission is not a certainty. What is
best suited to a person of Mr. Micawber's peculiar temperament, is, I am
convinced, a certainty."
     Traddles and I both expressed, by a feeling murmur, that this great
 discovery was no doubt true of Mr. Micawber, and that it did him much
credit.
     " I will not conceal from you, my dear Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs.
Micawber, "that I have long felt the Brewing business to be particularly
adapted to Mr. Micawber. Look at Barclay and Yerkins ! Look at Tru-
man, Hanbury, and Buxton ! I t is on that extensive footing that Mr.
Micawber, I know from my own knowledge of him, is calculated to shine;
and the profits, I am told, are e-NOR-mous ! But if Mr. Micawber cannot
get into those firms-which decline to answer his letters, when he offers
his services even in an inferior capacity-what is the use of dwelling
upon that idea? None. I may have a conviction that Mr. Micawber's
manners "-
                            OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   " Hem ! Really, my dear," interposed Mr. Micawber.
   " My love, be silent,"     said Mrs. Micawber, laying her brown glove on his
 hand. "I may have a conviction, Mr. Copperfield, that Mr. hficawber's
 manners peculiarly qualify him for the Banking business. I may argue
 within myself, that if I had a deposit at a banking-house, the manners of
 Mr. Micawber, as representing that banking-house, would inspire confi-
 dence, and must extend the connexion. But if the various banking-houses
 refuse to avail themselves of Mr. Micawber's abilities, or receive the offer
 of them with contumely, what is the use of dwelling upon that idea?
 None. As t,o originating a banking-business, I may know that there are
 members of my family who, if they chose to place their money in
 Mr. Micawber's hands, might found an establishment of that description.
 But i i they do not choose to place their money in Mr. Micawber's hands-
which they don't-what is the use of that? Again I contend that we are
 no farther advanced than we were before."
    I shook my head, and said, "Not a bit." Traddles also shook his
head, and said, "Not a bit."
    "What do I deduce from this? " Mrs. Micawber went on to say, still
with the same air of putting a case lucidly. " What is the conclusion, my
 dear Mr. Copperfield, to which I am irresistibly brought? Am I wrong
in saying, it is clear that we must live? "
    I answered, "Not at all ! " and Traddles answered, "Not at all ! " and
I found myself afterwards sagely adding, alone, that a person must either
live or die.
   "Just so," returned Mrs. Micawber. " I t is precisely that. And the fact
is, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that we can not live without something
widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up. Now I am
convinced, myself, and this I have pointed out to Mr.Micawber several times
of late, that things cannot be expected to turn up of themselves. We
must, in a measure, assist to turn them up. I may be wrong, but I have
formed that ooinion."
   Both ~ r a d d l e sand I applauded it highly.
   "Very well," said Mrs. Micawber. "Then what do I recommend?
Here is Mr. Micawber, with a variety of qualifications-with great
talent-"
    " Really, my love," said Mr. Micawber.

    "Pray, my dear, allow me to conclude. Here is Mr. Micawber, with a
variety of qualifications, with great talent-I should say, with genius,
but that may be the partiality of a wife-"
   Traddles and I both murmured " No."
   "And here is Mr. Micawber without any suitable position or employ-
ment. Where does that responsibility rest? Clearly on society. Then I
would make a fact so disgraceful known, and boldly challenge society to
set it right. I t appears to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs.
Micawber, forcibly, "that what Mr. Micawber has to do, is to throw down
the gauntlet to society, and say, in eEect, 'Show me who will take that up.
Let the party immediately step forward.' "
   I ventured to ask Mrs. Micawber how this was to be done.
   "By advertising," said Mrs. Micawber-" in all the papers. I t appears
to me, that what Mr. Micawber has to do, in justice to himself, in justice
296            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

to his family, and I will even go so far as to say in justice to society, by
which he has been hitherto overlooked, is to advertise in all the papers ;
to describe himself plainly as so and so, with such and such qualifications,
and to put it thus : 'Now employ me, on remunerative terms, and address,
post-paid, to W. M., Post Office, Camden Town.' "
    "This idea of Mrs. Micawber's, my dear Copperfield," said Mr.
Micawber, making his shirt-collar meet in front of his chin, and glancing
at me sideways, " is, in fact, the Leap to which I alluded, when I last had
the pleasure of seeing you."
    "Advertising is rather expensive," I remarked, dubiously.
    " Exactly so ! " said Mrs. Micawber, preserving the same logical air.
" Quite true, my dear Mr. Copperfield ! I have made the identical observa-
tion to Mr. Micawber. I t is for that reason especially, that 1 think Mr.
Micawber ought (as I have already said, in justice to himself, in justice to
his family, and in justice to society) to raise a certain sum of money-on
a bill."
    Mr. Micawber, leaning back in his chair, trifled with his eye-glass, and
cast his eyes up at the ceiling; but I thought him observant of Traddles
too, who was looking at the fire.
    '< If no member of my family," said Mrs. Micawber, " is possessed of
sufficient natural feeling to negotiate that bill-I believe there is a better
business-term to express what I mean-"
    Mr. Micawber, with his eyes still cast up at the ceiling, suggested
 " Discount."
     " To discount that bill," said Mrs. Micawber, " then my opinion is, that

 Mr. Micawber should go into the City, should take that billinto the Money
 Market, and should dispose of it for what he can get. If the individuals
 in the Money Market oblige Mr. Micawber to sustain a great sacrifice,
 that is between themselves and their consciences. I view it, steadily, as
 an investment. I recommend Mr. Micawber, my dear Mr. Copperfield, to
 do the same ; to regard it as an investment which is sure of return, and
 to make up his mind to any sacrifice."
     I felt, but I am sure I don't know why, that this was self-denying and
 devoted in Mrs. Micawber, and I uttered a murmur to that effect. Trad-
 dles, who took his tone from me, did likewise, still looking at the fire.
     " I will not," said Mrs. Micawber, finishing her punch, and gathering
 her scarf about her shoulders, preparatory to her withdrawal to my bed-
 room : " I will not protract these remarks on the subject of Mr. Micawber's
 pecuniary affairs. At your fireside, my dear Mr. Copperfield, and in the
 presence of Mr. Traddles, who, though not so old a friend, is quite one
 of ourselves, I could not refrain from making you acquainted with
 the course I advise Mr. Micawber to take. I feel that the t ~ m eis arrived
 when Mr. Micawber should exert himself and-I will add-assert himself,
 and it appears to me that these are the means. I am aware that I am
 merely a female, and that a masculine judgment is usually considered more
 competent to the discussion of such questions ; still I must not forget that,
 when I lived at home with my papa and mama, my papa was in the habit
 of saying, ' Emma's form is fragile, but her grasp of a subject is inferior to
 none.' That my papa was too partial, I well know; but that he was an
  observer of character in some degree, my duty and my reason equally forbid
 me to doubt."
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          297
    With these words, and resisting our entreaties that she would grace the
remaining circulation of the punch with her presence, Mrs. Micawber
retired to my bed-room. And really I felt that she was a noble woman-
the sort of woman who might have been a Roman matron, and done all
manner of heroic things, in times of public trouble.
    I n the fervor of this impression, I congratulated Mr. Micawber on the
treasure he possessed. So did Traddles. Mr. Micawber extended his hand
to each of us in succession, and then covered his face with his pocket-
handkerchief, which I think had more snuff upon it than he was aware of.
H e then returned to the punch, in the highest state of exhilaration.
    H e was full of eloquence. H e gave us to understand that in our chil-
dren we lived again, and that, under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties,
any accession to their number was doubly welcome. He said that Mrs.
Micawber had latterly had her doubts on this point, but that he had dis-
pelled them, and reassured her. As to her family, they were totally
unworthy of her, and their sentiments were utterly indifferent to him,
 and they might-I quote his own expression-go to the Devil.
     Mr. Micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on Traddles. He said
 Traddles's was a character, to the steady virtues of which he (Mr. Micawber)
 could lay no claim, but which, he thanked Heaven, he could admire. H e
 feelingly alluded to the young lady, unknown, whom Traddles had honored
 with his affection, and who had reciprocated that affection by honoring
 and blessing Traddles with her affection. Mr. Micawber pledged her. So
 did I. Traddles thanked us both, by saying, with a simplicity and
 honesty I had sense enough to be quite charmed with, " I am very much
 obliged to you indeed. And I do assure you, she's the dearest girl!--"
     Mr. Micawber took an early opportunity, after that, of hinting, with the
 utmost delicacy and ceremony, at the state of my affections. Nothing but
 the serious assurance of his friend Copperfield to the contrary, he observed,
 could deprive him of the impression that his friend Copperfield loved and
 was beloved. After feeling very hot and uncomfortable for some time,
 and after a good deal of blushing, stammering, and denying, I said,
 having my glass in my hand, " Well ! I would give them D. ! " which so
 excited and gratified Mr. Micawber, that he ran with a glass of punch
 into my bed-room, in order that Mrs. Micawber might drink D., who
  drank it wit11 enthusiasm, crying from within, in a shrill voice, " Hear,
  hear ! My dear Mr. Copperfield, I am delighted. Hear ! " and tapping
  at the wall, by way of applause.
     Our conversation, afterwards, took a more worldly turn ; Mr. hficawber
  telling us that he found Camden Town inconvenient, and that the first
  thing he contemplated doing, when the advertisement should have been
 the cause of something satisfactory turning up, was to move. He men-
  tioned a terrace at the western end of Oxford Street, fronting Hyde Park,
  on which he had always had his eye, but which he did not expect to attain
  immediately, as it would require a large establishment. There would
  probably be an interval, he explained, in which he should content himself
  with the upper part of a house, over some respectable place of business,
  -say inPiccadilly,--which    would be a cheerful situation for Mrs.Micawber;
  and where, by throwing out a bow window, or carrying up the roof
  another story, or making some little alteration of that sort, they might
298           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

live, comfortably and reputably, for a few years. Whatever was reserved
for him, he expressly said, or wherever his abode might be, we might rely
on this-there would always be a room for Traddles, and a knife and fork
for me. We acknowledged his kindness ; and he begged us to forgive his
having launched into these practical and business-like details, and to
excuse it as natural in one who was making entirely new arrangements
in life.
   Mrs. Micawber, tapping at the wall again, to know if tea were ready,
broke up this particular phase of our friendly conversation. She made
tea for us in a most agreeable manner ; and, whenever I went near her, in
handing about the tea-cups and bread-and-butter, asked me, in a whisper,
whether D. was fair, or dark, or whether she was short, or tall : or some-
thing of that kind; which I think I liked. After tea, we discussed a
variety of topics before the fire ; and Mrs. Micawber was good enough
to sing us (in a small, thin, flat voice, which I remember to have consi-
dered, when I first knew her, the very table-beer of acoustics) the favorite
ballads of "The Dashing White Serjeant," and "Little Tafflin." Por
both of these songs Mrs. Micawber had been famous when she lived at
home with her papa and mama. Mr. Micawber told us, that when he
heard her sing the first one, on the first occasion of his seeing her beneath
the parental roof, she had attracted his attention in an extraordinary
degree; but that when it came to Little T d i n , he had resolved to win
that woman or perish in the attempt.
    I t was between ten and eleven o'clock when Mrs. Micawber rose to
 replace her cap in the whitey-brown paper parcel, and to put on her
bonnet. Mr. Micawber took the opportunity of Traddles putting on his
 great coat, to slip a letter into my hand, with a whispered request that I
 would read it at my leisure. I also took the opportunity of my holding a
 candle over the bannisters to light them down, when Mr. Micawber was
 going first, leading Mrs. Micawber, and Traddles mas following with the
 cap, to detain Traddles for a moment on the top of the stairs.
    " Traddles," said I, " Mr. Micawber don't mean any harm, poor fellow ;
 but, if I were you, I wouldn't lend him anything."
    " My dear Copperfield," returned Traddles, smiling, " 1 haven't       got
 anything to lend."
    "You have got a name, you know," said I.
    " Oh! You call that something to lend? " returned Traddles, with a
 thoughtful look.
    " Certainly ."
    <'Oh ! " said Traddles. "Yes, to be sure ! I am very much obliged
 to you, Copperfield ; but-I am afraid I have lent him that already."
    " Por the bill that is to be a certain investment ? " I inquired.
    " No," said Traddles.     " Not for that one. This is the first I have
 heard of that one. I have been thinking that he will most likely
 propose that one, on the way home. Mine's another."
    " I hope there will be nothing wrong about it," said I.

    " I hope not," said Traddles. " I should think not, though, because
 he told me, only the other day, that it was provided for. That was Mr.
 Micawber's expression. ' Providcd for."'
    Mr. Micawber looking up at this juncture to where we were standing, I
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          299
had only time to repeat my caution. Traddles thanked me, and descended.
But I was much afraid, when I observed the good-natured manner in
which he went down with the cap in his hand, and gave Mrs. Micawber
his arm, that he would be carried into the Money Market neck and heels.
   I returned to my fireside, and was musing, half gravely and half
laughing, on the character of Mr. Micawber and the old relations between
us, when I heard a quick step ascending the stairs. At first, I thought
it was Traddles coming back for something Mrs. Micawber had left behind ;
but as the step approached, I knew it, and felt my heart beat high, and
the blood rush to my face, for it was Steerforth's.
   I was never unmindful of Agnes, and she never left that sanctuary in
 my thoughts-if I may call it so-where I had placed her from the first.
But when he entered, and stood before me with his hand out, the dark-
ness that had fallen on him changed to light, and I felt confounded and
ashamed of having doubted one I loved so heartily. I loved her none the
less ; I thought of her as the same benignant, gentle angel in my life ;
I reproached myself, not her, with having done him an injury ; and I would
have made him any atonement if I had known what to make, and how
to make it.
   "Why, Daisy, old boy, dumb-foundered ! " laughed Steerforth, shaking
my hand heartily, and throwing it gaily away. "Have I detected you in
another feast, you Sybarite ! These Doctors' Commons fellows are the
gayest men in town, I believe, and beat us sober Oxford people all to
nothing ! " His bright glance went merrily round the room, as he took
the seat on the sofa opposite to me, which Mrs. Micawber had recently
vacated, and stirred the fire into a blaze.
   " I was so surprised at first," said I, giving him welcome with all the

cordiality I felt, "that I had hardly breath to greet you with, Steerforth."
   " Well, the sight of me is good for sore eyes, as the Scotch say,"

replied Steerforth, "and so is the sight of you, Daisy, in full bloom.
How are you, my Bacchanal?"
   " I am very well," said I ;" and not at allBacchanalian to-night, though
I confess to another party of three."
   " All of whom I met in the street, talking loudin your praise," returned
Steerforth. " Who 's our friend in the tights ? "
   I gave him the best idea I could, in a few words, of Mr. Micawber.
H e laughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman, and said he
was a man to know, and he must know him.
   " But who do you suppose our other friend i s ? " said I, in my turn.

   "Heaven knows," said Steerforth. " Not a bore, I hope ? I thought
he looked a little like one."
   " Traddles ! " I replied, triumphantly.

   " Who 's he? " asked Steerforth, in his careless way.
   "Don't you remember Traddles? Traddles in our room at Salem
House ? "
   " Oh ! That fellow ! " said Steerforth, beating a lump of coal on the
top of the fire, with the poker. "Is he as soft as ever ? And where the
deuce did you pick him up ? "
   1extolled Traddles in reply, as highly as I could; for I felt that Steer-
forth rather slighted him. Steerforth, dismissing the subject with a light
300            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

nod, and a smile, and the remark that he would be glad to see the old fellow
too, for he had always been an odd fish, inquired if I could give him any-
thing to eat? During most of this short dialogue, when he had not been
speaking in a wild vivacious manner, he had sat idly beating on the lump
of coal with the poker. I observed that he did the same thing while I
was getting out the remains of the pigeon-pie, and so forth.
    " Why, Daisy, here 's a supper for a king ! " he exclaimed, starting out
of his silence with a burst, and taking his seat at the table. " I shall do
it justice, for I have come from Yarmouth."
    "I thought you came from Oxford? " I returned.
    " Not I, " said Steerforth.   " I have been seafaring-better    employed."
    " Littimer was here to-day, to inquire for you," I remarked, " and I

understood him that you were at Oxford ; though, now I think of it, he
certainly did not say so."
    " Littimer is a greater fool than I thought him, to have been inquiring

for me at all," said Steerforth, jovially pouring out a glass of wine, and
drinking to me. "As to understanding him, you are a cleverer fellow
than most of us, Daisy, if you can do that."
    " That's true, indeed," said I, moving my chair to the table. " SO
you have been at Yarmouth, Steerforth! " interested to know all about it.
" Have you been there long ? "

    " No," he returned. " An escapade of a week or so."
    "And how are they all? Of course, little Emily is not married yet ? "
    "Not yet. Going to be, I believe-in so many weeks, or months, or
something or other. I have not seen much of 'em. By-the-by ;" he
laid down his knife and fork, which he had been using with great dili-
gence, and began feeling in his pockets ; " I have a letter for you."
    " From whom ? "
    "Why, from your old nurse," he returned, taking some papers out of
his breast pocket. " ' J. Steerforth, Esquire, debtor, to the Willing
Mind; ' that's not it. Patience, and we '11 find it presently. Old what's-
his-name's in a bad way, and it's about that, I believe."
    " Barkis, do you mean? "
    "Yes ! " still feeling in his pockets, and looking over their contents :
 " it's all over with poor Barltis, I am afraid.      I saw a little apothecary
there-surgeon, or whatever he is-who brought your worship into the
world. H e was mighty learned about the case, to me ; but the upshot of
his opinion was, that the carrier was making his last journey rather fast.-
Put your hand into the breast pocket of my great coat on the chair yonder,
and I think you 1' 1 find the letter. I s it there ? "
    " Here it is ! " said I.

    " That's right ! "

    I t was from Peggotty ; something less legible than usual, and brief. I t
informed me of her husband's hopeless state, and hinted at his being
 " a little nearer " than heretofore,    and consequently more difficult to
manage for his own comfort. I t said nothing of her weariness and watch-
ing, and praised him highly. I t was written with a plain, unaffected,
 homely piety that I knew to be genuine, and ended with " my duty to my
 ever darling "-meaning myself.
    Vhile I deciphered it, Steerforth continued to eat and drink.

    c c I t ' s a bad job,'"e said, when I had done ; " but the sun sets every
day, and people die every minute, and we mustn't be scared by the
common lot. If we failed to hold our own, because that equal foot at
all men's doors was heard knocking somewhere, every object in this world
would slip from us. No ! Ride on ! Rough-shod if need be, smooth-shod
if that will do, but ride on ! Ride over all obstacles, and win the race ! "
    "And win what race? " said 1.
    " The race that one has started in," said he. " Ride on ! "
   I noticed, I remember, as he paused, looking at me with his handsome
head a little thrown back, and his glass raised in his hand, that, though
the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face, and it was ruddy, there
were traces in it, made since I Iast saw it, as if he had applied himself to
some habitual strain of the fervent energy which, when roused, was so pas-
sionately roused within him. I had it in my thoughts to remonstrate
with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy that he took-
such as this buffetting of rough seas, and braving of hard weather, for
example-when my mind glanced off to the immediate subject of our
conversation again, and pursued that instead.
     " I tell you what, Steerforth," said I, " if your high spirits will listen

to me "-
    "They are potent spirits, and will do whatever you like," he answered,
moving from the table to the fireside again.
    " Then I tell you what, Steerforth.      I think I will go down and see
my old nurse. I t is not that I can do her any good, or render her any real
 service; but she is so attached to me that my visit will have as much
effect on her, as if I could do both. She will take it so kindly that it will
be a comfort and support to her. I t is no great effort to make, I am sure,
for such a friend as she has been to me. Wouldn't you go a day's
journey, if you were in my place ?"
    His face was thoughtful, and he sat considering a little before he
answered, in a low voice, "Well ! Go. You can do no harm."
     " You have just come back," said I, " and it would be in vain to ask
you to go with me ? "
     " Quite," he returned. " I am for Highgate to-night. I have not
 seen my mother this long time, and it lies upon my conscience, for it's
 something to be loved as she loves her prodigal son.--Bah ! Nonsense !-
 You mean to go to-morrow, I suppose ? " he said, holding me out at arm's
 length, with a hand on each of my shoulders.
     " Yes, I think so."

     " Well, then, don't go till next day.    I wanted you to come and stay
 a few days with us. Here I am, on purpose to bid you, and you fly off to
Yarmouth ! "
     " You are a nice fellow to talk of flying off, Steerforth, who are always

 running wild on some unknown expedition or other ! "
     He looked at me for a moment without speaking, and then rejoined, still
 holding me as before, and giving me a shake :
     " Come ! Say the next day, and pass as much of to-morrow as you can

 with us ! Who knows when we may meet again, else? Come ! Say the
 next day ! I want you to stand between Rosa Dartle and me, and keep
 US asunder."
     " Would you love each other too much, without me ? "
               THE   PERSONAL    HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Yes ; or hate," laughed Steerforth; " no matter which. Come ! Say
the next day ! "
    I said the next day; and he put on his great-coat, and lighted his cigar,
and set off to walk home. Finding him in this intention, I put on my
own great-coat (but did not light my own cigar, having had enough of
that for one while) and walked with him as far as the open road : a dull
road, then, at night. He was in great spirits all the way; and when we
parted, and I looked after him going so gallantly and airily homeward,
I thought of his saying, "Ride on over all obstacles, and win the race ! "
and wished, for the first time, that he had some worthy race to run.
    I was undressing in my own room, when Mr. Micawber's letter tumbled
on the floor. Thus reminded of it, I broke the seal and read as follows.
I t was dated an hour and a half before dinner. I am not sure whether I
have mentioned that, when Mr. Micawber was at any particularly desperate
crisis, he used a sort of legal phraseology: which he seemed to think
equivalent to winding up his affairs.
    " Sir-for I dare not say, my dear Copperfield,
    " I t is expedient that I should inform you that the undersigned is
Crushed. Some flickering efforts to spare you the premature knowledge
of his calamitous position, you may observe in him this day; but hope
has sunk beneath the horizon, and the undersigned is Crushed.
    " The present    communication is penned within the personal range
(I cannot call it the society) of an individual, in a state closely bordering
on intoxication, employed by a broker. That individual is in legal posses-
sion of thc premises, under a distress for rent. His inventory includes,
not only the chattels and effects of every description belonging to the
undersigned, as yearly tenant of this habitation, but also those apper-
taining to Mr. Thomas Traddles, lodger, a member of the Honourable
Society of the Inner Temple.
    " If any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup, which is
now ' commended ' (in the language of an immortal Writer) to the lips of the
undersigned, it would be found in the fact, that afriendly acceptance granted
to the undersigned, by the before-mentioned Mr. Thomas Traddles, for the
sum of 8 2 3 4s. Dfrd. is over due, and is NOT provided for. Also, in the
fact, that the living responsibilities clinging to the undersigned, will, in the
course of nature, be increased by the sum of one more helpless victim ; whose
miserable appearance may be looked for-in round numbers-at the expira-
tion of a period not exceeding six lunar months from the present date.
    " After premising thus much, it would be a work of supererogation to
add, that dust and ashes are for ever scattered
                         " On

                                      " WILKINSMICAWBEE."
   Poor Traddles! I knew enough of Mr. Micawber by this time, to
foresee that he might be expected to recover the blow; but my night's
rest was sorely distressed by thoughts of Traddles, and of the curate's
daughter, who was one of ten, down in Devonshire, and who was such
a dear girl, and who would wait for Traddles (ominous praise !) until she
was sixty, or any age that could be mentioned.

                          CHAPTER XXIX.
              I VISIT STEERFORTH AT HIS HOME, AGAIN.

    I MENTIONED to Mr. Spenlow in the morning, that I wanted leave of
absence for a short time; and as I was not in the receipt of any salary,
and consequently was not obnoxious to the implacable Jorkins, there was
no difficulty about it. I took that opportunity, with my voice sticking in
my throat, and my sight failing as I uttered the words, to express my hope
that Miss Spenlow was quite well ; to which Mr. Spenlow replied, with no
more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinary human being,
that he was much obliged to me, and she was very well.
    We articled clerks, as germs of the patrician order of proctors, were
treated with so much consideration, that I was almost my own master at
all times. As I did not care, however, to get to Highgate before one or
two o'clock in the day, and as we had another little excommunication case
in court that morning, which was called The office of the Judge promoted
by Tipkins against Bullock for his soul's correction, I passed an hour or
two in attendance on it with Mr. Spenlow very agreeably. I t arose out of
a scuffle between two churchwardens, one of whom was alleged to have
pushed the other against a pump ; the handle of which pump projecting
into a school-house, which school-house was under a gable of the church-
roof, made the push an ecclesiastical offence. I t was an amusing case ;and
sent me up to Highgate, on the box of the stage-coach, thinking about the
Commons, and what Mr. Spenlow had said about touching the Commons
and bringing down the country.
    Mrs. Steerforth was pleased to see me, and so was Rosa Dartle.
I was agreeably surprised to find that Littimer was not there, and that we
were attended by a modest little parlor-maid, with blue ribbons in her cap,
whose eye it was much more pleasant, and much less disconcerting, to
catch by accident, than the ej7e of that respectable man. But what I
particularly observed, before I had been half-an-hour in the house, was the
close and attentive watch Miss Dartle kept upon me; and the lurking
manner in which she seemed to compare my face with Steerforth's, and
 Steerforth's with mine, and to lie in wait for something to come out
between the two. So surely as I looked towards her, did I see that eager
visage, with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow, intent on mine; or
passing suddenly from mine to Steerforth's ; or comprehending both of
us at once. I n this lynx-like scrutiny she was so far from faltering
when she saw I observed it, that at such a time she only fixed her piercing
look upon me with a more intent expression still. Blameless as I was, and
knew that T was, in reference to any wrong she could possibly suspect me
 of, I shrunk before her strange eyes, quite unable to endure their
 hungry lustre.
    All day, she seemed to pervade the whole house. If I talked to
304           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

Steerforth in his room, I heard her dress rustle in the little gallery outside.
When he and I engaged in some of our old exercises on the lawn behind
the house, I saw her face pass from window to window, like a wandering
light, until it fixed itself in one, and watched us. When we all four went
out walking in the afternoon, she closed her thin hand on my arm like a
spring, to keep me back, while Steerforth and his mother went on out of
hearing : and then spoke to me.
    "You have been a long time," she said, "without coming here. I s
your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole
attention? I ask because I always want to be informed, when I am
ignorant. I s it really, though ?
    I replied that I liked it well enough, but that I certainly could not claim
so much for it.
    '< Oh ! I am glad to know that, because I always like to be put right
when I am wrong," said Rosa Dartle. " You mean it is a little dry,
perhaps ? "
    Well, I replied ; perhaps it was a little dry.
    " Oh ! and that's a reason why you want relief and change--excite-
ment, and all that ? " said she. "Ah ! very true ! But isn't it a little
-Eh         ?-for him; I don't mean you? "
    A quick glance of her eye towards the spot where Steerforth was walk-
ing, with his mother leaning on his arm, showed me whom she meant; but
beyond that, I was quite lost. And I looked so, I have no doubt.
     "Don't it-I don't say that it does, mind I want to know-don't             it
rather engross him? Don't it make him, perhaps, a little more remiss
than usual in his visits to his blindly doting-eh ? " With another
 quick glance at them, and such a glance at me as seemed to look into my
innermost thoughts.
     " Miss Dartle," I returned, "pray do not think-"
     " I don't ! " she said.     " Oh, dear me, don't suppose that I think any-

 thing ! I am not suspicious. I only ask a question. I don't state any
opinion. I want to found an opinion on what you tell me. Then, it's
not so ? Well ! I am very glad to know it."
     " I t certainly is not the fact," said I, perplexed, " that I am accountable

for Steerforth's having been away from home longer than usual-if he has
been : which I really don't know at this moment, unless I understand it
from you. I have not seen him this long while, until last night."
    "No?"
    " Indeed, Miss Dartle, no ! "
    As she looked full at me, I saw her face grow sharper and paler, and
the marks of the old wound lengthen out until it cut through the dis-
figured lip, and deep into the nether lip, and slanted down the face.
There was something positively awful to me in this, and in the brightness
 of her eyes, as she said, looking fixedly at me :
     " What is he doing? "

    I repeated the words, more to myself than her, being so amazed.
     "What is he doing ? " she said, with an eagerness that seemed enough
 to consume her like a fire. " I n what is that man assisting him, who
 never looks at me without an inscrutable falsehood in his eyes ? If you
 are honorable and faithful, I don't ask you to betray your friend. I ask
                           OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

  you only to tell me, is it anger, is it hatred, is it pride, is it restlessness,
  is it some wild fancy, is it love, what is it, that is leading him ? "
      "Miss Dartle," I returned, " how shall I tell you, so that you will
  believe me, that I know of nothing in Steerforth different from what there
  was when I first came here. I can think of nothing. I firmly believe
 there is nothing. I hardly understand, even, what you mean."
      As she still looked fixedly at me, a twitching or throbbing, from which
 I could not dissociate the idea of pain, came into that cruel mark; and
 lifted up the corner of her lip as if with scorn, or with a pity that despised
 its object. She put her hand upon it hurriedly-a hand so thin and
 delicate, that when I had seen her hold it up before the fire to shade her
 face, I had compared it in my thoughts to fine porcelain-and saying, in
 a quick, fierce, passionate way, " I swear you to secresy about this! "
 said not a word more.
     Mrs. Steerforth was particularly happy in her son's society, and Steer-
 forth was, on this occasion, particularly attentive and respectful to her.
 I t was very interesting to me to see them together, not only on account of
 their mutual affection, but because of the strong personal resemblance
 between them, and the manner in which what was haughty or impetuous in
 him was softened by age and sex, in her, to a gracious dignity. I thought,
 more than once, that it was well no serious cause of division had ever
 come between them ; or two such natures-I ought rather to express it,
 two such shades of the same nature-might have been harder to reconcile
 than the two extremest opposites in creation. The idea did not originate
in my own discernment, I am bound to confess, but in a speech of Rosa
 Dartle's.
     She said at dinner :
     "Oh, but do tell me, though, somebody, because I have been thinking
 about it all day, and I want to know."
   'I   You want to know what, Rosa?" returned Mrs. Steerforth. "Pray,
 pray, Rosa, do not be mysterious."
     '' Mysterious ! " she cried. " Oh ! really ? Do you consider me so ? "
     "Do I constantly entreat you," said Mrs. Steerforth, "to speak plainly,
in your own natural manner ? "
    " Oh! then, this is not my natural manner? " she rejoined. "Now
you must really bear with me, because I ask for information. We never
know ourselves."
    c'It has become a second nature," said Mrs. Steerforth, without any
displeasure ; "but I remember,-and so must you, I think,-when your
manner was different, Rosa ; when it was not so -guarded, and was more
trustful."
        I am sure you are right," she returned ; " and so it is that bad habits
grow upon one ! Really ? Less guarded and more trustful? How can
I, imperceptibly, have changed, I wonder ! Well, that 's very odd ! I
must study to regain my former self."
    6 r I wish you would," said Mrs. Steerforth, with a smile.

    " Oh ! I really will, you know ! " she answered. " I will learn frankness

from-let me see-from James."
        YOUcannot learn frankness, Rosa," said Nrs. Steerforth, quickly-for
there was always some effect of sarcasm in what Rosa Dartle said, though
                                                                    X
306           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AKD EXPERIENCE

it was said, as this was, in the most unconscious manner in the world-" in
a better school."
    " That I am sure of," she answered, with uncommon fervour. " If I
am sure of anything, of course, you know, I am sure of that."
    Mrs. Steerforth appeared to me to regret having been a little nettled;
for she presently said, in a kind tone :
   "Well, my dear Rosa, we have not heard what it is that you want to
be satisfied about ? "
    " That I want to be satisfied about ? " she replied, with provoking

coldness. " Oh ! I t was only whether people, who are like each other in
their moral constitutioii-is that the phrase ? "
    " It's as good a phrase as another," said Steerforth.

   <' Thank you :-whether people, who are like each other in their moral
constitution, are in greater danger than people not so circumstanced, sup-
posing any serious cause of variance to arise between them, of being
divided angrily and deeply ? "
      I should say yes," said Steerforth.
    " Should you ? " she retorted. " Dear me ! Supposing then, for instanec,

-any       unlikely thing will do for a supposition - that you and your
mother were to have a serious quarrel."
    " My dear Rosa," interposed Mrs. Steerforth, laughing good-naturedly,

" suggest some other supposition ! James and I know our duty to each

other better, I pray Heaven ! "
    " Oh ! " said &!tiss Dartle, nodding her head thoughtfully. " To be sure.

 That would prevent i t ? TThy, of course it would. Ex-actly. Now, I am
 glad I have been so foolish as to put the case, for it is so very good to
 know that your duty to each other would prevent i t ! Thank you very
 much."
    One other little circumstance connected with Miss Dartle I must not
 omit ; for I had reason to remember it thereafter, when all the irremediable
 past was rendered plain. During the whole of this day, but especially
 from this period of it, Steerforth exerted himself with his utmost skill,
 and that was with his utmost ease, to charm this singular creature into a
 pleasant and pleased companion. That hr should succeed, was no matter
 of surprise to me. That she should struggle against the fascinating
 influence of his delightful art-delightful nature I thought it then-did
 not surprise me either; for I knew that she was sometimes ja~xndiced
 and perverse. I saw her features and her manner slowly change; I saw
 her look at him with growing admiration ; I saw her try, more and more
 faintly, but always angrily, as if she condemned a weakness in herself,
 .to resist the captivating powrr that he possessed; and finally I saw her
 sharp glance soften, and her smile become quite gentle, and I ceased to be
 afraid of her as I hail really b ~ e nall day, and we all sat about the fire,
 talking and laughing together, with as little reserve as if we had been
 children.
     Whether it was because we had sat there so long, or beca~tseSteerforth
 was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained, I do not know;
 but we did not remain in the dining-room more than five minutes after
 her departure. " She is playing her harp," said Steerforth, softly, at the
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          307
drawing-room door, " and nobody but my mother has heard her do that,
I believe, these three years." He said it with a curious smile, which was
gone directly ; and we went into the room and found her alone.
   "Don't get up ! " said Steerforth (which she had already done) ; "my
dear Rosa, don't ! Be kind for once, and sing us an Irish song."
   "What do you care for an Irish song? " she returned.
   " Much ! " said Steerforth.    " Much more than for any oiher.     Here is
Daisy, too, loves music from his soul. Sing us an Irish song, Rosa ! and
let me sit and listen as I used to do."
   H e did not touch her, or the chair from which she had risen, but sat
himselfnear the harp. She stood beside it for some little while, in a curious
way, going through the motion of playing it with her right hand, but not
sounding it. At length she sat down, and drew it to her with one sudden
action, and played and sang.
   I don't know what it was, in her touch or voice, that made that song
the most unearthly I have ever heard in my life, or can imagine.
There was something fearful in the reality of it. I t was as if it had
never been written, or set to music, but sprung out of the passion
within her; which found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her
voice, and crouched again when all was st~ll. I was dumb when she
leaned beside the harp again, playing it, but not sounding it, with her
right hand.
   A minute more, and this had roused me from my trance :-Steerforth
had left his seat, and gone to her, and had put his arm laughingly
about her, and had said, " Come, Rosa, for the future we will love each
other very much ! " And she had struck him, and had thrown him off with
the fury of a wild cat, and had burst out of the room.
   " What is the matter with Rosa ? " said Mrs. Steerforth, coming in.

   "She has been an angel, mother," returned Steerforth, " for a little
while; and has run into the opposite extreme, since, by way of com-
pensation."
   " You should be careful not to irritate her, James. Her temper has
been soured, remember, and ought not to be tried."
   Rosa did not come back; and no other mention was made of her, until
I went with Steerforth into his room to say Good night. Then he
laughed about her, and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little
piece of incomprehensibility.
   I expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of
expression, and asked if he could guess what it was that she had taken
so much amiss, so suddenly.
   " Oh, Heaven knows,"       said Steerforth. " Any thing you like-or
nothing ! I told you she took every thing, herself included, to a grind-
stone, and sharpened it. She is an edge-tool, and requires great care
in dealing with. She is always dangerous. Good night ! "
   " Good night ! " said I, " my dear Steerforth !  I shall be gone before
you wake in the morning. Good night ! "
   He was unwilling to let me go ; and stood, holding me out, with a hand
on each of my shoulders, as he had done in my own room.
   " Daisy,"   he said, with a smile-" for though that's not the
                                                              x2

name your Godfathers and Godmothers gave you, it's the name I like
best to call you by-and        I wish, I wish, I wish, you could give it
to me !"
   '' Why so I can, if I choose," said I.
   " Daisy, if anything should ever separate us, you must think of me at
my best, old boy. Come ! Let us make that bargain. Think of me at my
best, if circumstances should ever part us ! "
   " You have no best to me, Steerforth," said I, " and no worst.     You
are always equally loved, and cherished in my heart."
   So much compunction for having ever wronged him, even by a shapeless
thought, did I feel within me, that the confession of having done so was
rising to my lips. But for the reluctance I had, to betray the confidence
of Agnes, but for my uncertainty how to approach the subject with no
risk of doing so, it would have reached them before he said, " God bless
you, Daisy, and good night ! " I n my doubt, it did not reach them ; and
we shook hands, and we parted.
   I was up with the dull dawn, and, having dressed as quietly as I could,
looked into his room. H e was fast asleep ; lying, easily, with his head
upon his arm, as I had often seen him lie at school.
   The time came in its season, and that was very soon, when I almost
wondered that nothing troubled his repose, as I looked at him. But he
slept-let me think of him so again-as I had often seen him sleep at
school ; and thus, in this silent hour, I left him.
   -Never more, oh God forgive you, Steerforth ! to touch that passive
hand in love and friendship. Never, never, more!




                            CHAPTER XXX.
                                   A   Loss.
   I GOT down to Yarmouth in the evening, and went to the inn. I knew
that Peggotty's spare room-my room-was likely to have occupation
enough in a little while, if that great Visitor, before whose presence all the
living must give place, were not already in the house; so I betook myself
to the inn, and dined there, and engaged my bed.
   I t was ten o'clock when I went out. Many of the shops were shut,
and the town was dull. When I came to Omer and Joram's, I found the
shutters up, but the shop door standing open. As I could obtain a per-
spective view of Mr. Omer inside, smoking his pipe by the parlor-door,
I entered, and asked him how he was.
   " Why, bless my life and soul! " said Mr. Omer, "how do you find
yourself? Take a seat.-Smoke not disagreeable, I hope ? "
   " By no means," said I.      " I like it-in somebody else's pipe."
   " What, not in your own, eh? " Mr. Omer returned, laughing. "All
the better, sir. Bad habit for a young man. Take a seat. I smoke.
myself, for the asthma."
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           309
    Mr. Omer had made room for me, and placed a chair. He now sat
down again, very much out of breath, gasping at his pipe as if it contained
a supply of that necessary, without which he must perish.
    " I am sorry to have heard bad news of Mr. Barkis," said I.

    Mr. Omer looked at me, with a steady countenance, and shook his head.
    " DO you know how he is to-night ? " I asked.
    " The very question I should have put to you, sir," returned Mr. Omer,
" but on account of delicacy.       I t ' s one of the drawbacks of our line of
business. When a party's ill, we can't ask how the party is."
    The difficulty had not occurred to me ; though I had had my apprehensions
too, when I went in, of hearing the old tune. On its being mentioned,
I recognised it, however, and said as much.
    " Yes, yes, you understand,"     said Mr. Omer, nodding his head. "We
durstn't do it. Bless you, it would be a shock that the generality of parties
mightn't recover, to say ' Omer and Jorams's compliments, and how do
you find yourself this morning '-or this afternoon-as it may be."
    Mr. Omer and I nodded at each other, and Mr. Omer recruited his
wind b.y the aid of his pipe.
    " I t ' s one of the things that cut the trade off from attentions they
could often wish to show," said Mr. Omer. "Take myself. If I have
known Barkis a year, to move to as he went by, I have known him forty
year. But I can't go and say ' how is he ? ' "
    I felt it was rather hard on Mr. Omer, and I told him so.
    " I 'm     not more self-interested, I hope, than another man," said
Mr. Omer. " Look at me ! My wind may fail me at any moment, and it
ain't likely that, to my own knowledge, I ' d be self-interested under such
circumstances. I say it ain't likely, in a man who knows his wind will
go, when it does go, as if a pair of bellows was cut open; and that man a
grandfather," said Mr. Omer.
   I said, "Not at all."
    " I t ain't that I complain of my line of business," said Mr. Omer.

" I t ain't that. Some good and some bad goes, no doubt, to all callings.
What I wish, is, that parties were brought up stronger-minded."
    Mr. Omer, with a very complacent and amiable face, took several puffs
in silence ; and then said, resuming his first point.
    " Accordingly we're obleeged, in ascertaining how Barkis goes on, to limit

ourselves to Em'ly. She knows what our real objects are, and she don't
have any more alarms or suspicions about us, than if we was so many
lambs. Minnie and Joram have just stepped down to the house, in fact
(she's there, after hours, helping her aunt a bit), to ask her how he is to-
night; and if you was to please to wait till they come back, they'd give
you full partic'lers. Will you take something ? A glass of srub and water,
now? I smoke on srub and water, myself," said Mr. Omer, taking
up his glass, " because it's considered softening to the passages, by
which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action. But, Lord bless
you," said Mr. Omer, huskily, " it ain't the passages that's out of order !
 ' Give me breath enough,' says I to my daughter Minnie, ' and I'll find
passages, my dear.' "
    H e really had no breath to spare, and it was very alarming to see him
laugh. When he was again in a condition to be talked to, I thanked him
310             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 for the proffered refreshment, which I declined, as I had just had dinner;
 and, observing that I would wait, since he was so good as to invite me, until
 his daughter and his son-in-law came back, I inquired how little Emily
 was ?
     "Well, sir," said Mr. Omer, removing his pipe, that he might rub his
 chin; " I tell you truly, I shall be glad when her marriage has taken
place."
     " Why so?" I inquired.
     " Well, she's unsettled at present,"       said Mr. Omer. " It ain't that
 she's not as pretty as ever, for she's prettier-I do assure you, she is prettier.
I t ain't that she don't work as well as ever, for she does. She mas
worth any six, and she is worth any six. But somehow she wants heart.
If you understand," said Mr. Omer, after rubbing his chin again, and
smoking a little, " what I mean in a general way by the expression,
' A long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull altogether, my hearties,
hurrah !' I should say to you, that thal was-in a general way-what
I miss in Em'ly."
    Mr. Omer's face and manner went for so much, that I could conscien-
tiously nod my head, as divining his meaning. My quickness of appre-
hension seemed to please him, and he went on :
    " Now, I consider this is principally on account of her being in an
unsettled state, you see. We have talked it over a good deal, her uncle
and myself, and her sweetheart and myself, after business ; and I consider
it is principally on account of her being unsettled. You must always
recollect of Em'ly," said Mr. Omer, shaking his head gently, " that she's a
most extraordinary affectionate llttle thing. The proverb says, ' You can't
make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.' Well, I don't know about that.
I rather think you may, if you begin early in life. She has made a home
 out of that old boat, sir, that stone and marble couldn't beat."
     " I am sure she has !" said I.
     " To see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle," said
3fr. Omer ; " to see the way she holds on to him, tlghter and tighter, and
closer and closer, every day, is to see a sight. Now, you know, there's a
struggle going on when that's the case. Why should it be made a longer
one than is needful? "
    I listened attentively to the good old fellow, and acquiesced, with all my
heart, in what he said.
    " Therefore, I mentioned to them," said Mr. Omer, in a comfortable,
easy-going tone, " this. I said, 'Now, don't consider Em'ly nailed down
in point of time, at all. Make it your own time. Her services have been
more valuable than was supposed; her learning has been quicker than
was snpposed ; Omer and Joram can run their pen through what remains ;
and she's free when you wish. If she likes to make any little arrange-
ment, afterwards, in the way of doing any little thing for us at home, very
well. If she don't, very well still. We 're no losers, anyhow.' For-
don't you see," said Mr. Omer, touching me with his pipe, " it ain't
likely that a man so short of breath as myself, and a grandfather too,
would go and strain points with a little bit of a blue-eyed blossom, like
her ? "
    cc Not at all, I am certain," said I.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          311
  " Not at all ! You 're right ! " said Mr. Omer. " Well, sir, her cousin
-you  know it's a cousin she's going to be married to ? "
  " Oh jes," I replied.    " I know him well."
    " Of course you do," said nlr. Omer.    " Well, sir !  Her cousin being,
as it appears, in good work, and well to do, thanked me in a very manly
sort of manner for this (conducting himself altogether, I: must say, In a way
that gives me a high opinion of him), and went and took as comfortable a
little house as you or I could wish to clap eyes on. That little house is
now furnished, right through, as neat and complete as a doll's parlor;
and but for Barkis's illness having taken this bad turn, poor fellow, they
would have been man and wife-I dare say, by this time. As it is, there's
a postponement."
    " And Emily, Mr. Omer ? " I inquired. " Has she become more
settled ? "
    r c \Thy that, you know," he returned, rubbing his double chin again,
" can't naturally be expected. The prospect of the change and separation,
and all that, is, as one may say, close to her and far away from her, both at
once. Barkis's death needn't put it off much, but his lingering might.
Anyway, it's an uncertain state of matters, you see."
    " I see," said I.
    '< Consequently," pursued ;Mr. Omer, " Em'ly 's still a little down, and
a little fluttered; perhaps, upon the whole, she's more so than she was.
Every day she seems to get fonder and fonder of her uncle, and more loth
to part from all of us. A kind word from me brings the tears into her
eyes ; and if you was to see her with my daughter Minnie's little girl,
you'd never forget it. Bless my heart alive ! " said Mr. Omer, pondering,
<' how she loves that child ! "
    Haling so favourable an opportunity, it occurred to me to ask Mr.
Omer, before our conversation should be interrupted by the return of his
daughter and her husband, whether he knew anythmg of Martha.
    " Ah ! " he rejoined, shaking his head, and looking very much dejected.
" N o good. A sad story, sir, however you come to know it. I never
thought there was harm in the girl. I wouldn't wish to mentionit before
my daughter Minnie-for she'd take me up directly-but I never did.
None of us ever did."
    Mr. Omer, hearing his daughter's footstep before I heard it, touched me
with his pipe, and shut up one eye, as a caution. She and her husband
came in immediately afterwards.
    Their report was, that Xr. Barkis was " as bad as bad could be ; " that
he was qulte unconscious ; and that Mr. Chilhp had mournfully said in the
kitchen, on go~ngaway just now, that the College of Physicians, the
College of Surgeons, and Apothecaries' Hall, if they were all called in
together, couldn't help hlm. He was past both Colleges, Mr. Chillip said,
and the Hall could only poison h ~ m .
    Hearing this, and learning that Mr. Peggotty was there, I determined
to go to the house at once. I bade good night to Mr. Omer, and to Mr.
and Mrs. Joram; and directed my steps thither, with a solemn feeling,
which made Mr. Barkis quite a new and different creature.
    My low tap at the door was answered by Mr. Peggotty. He was not
so much surprised to see me as I had expected. I remarked this in
312            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  Peggotty, too, when she came down ; and I have seen it since ; and I think,
 in the expectation of that dread surprise, all other changes and surprises
 dwindle into nothing.
     I shook hands with Mr. Peggotty, and passed into the kitchen, while he
 softly closed the door. Little Emily was sitting by the fire, with her
 hands before her face. Ham was standing near her.
    We spoke in whispers ; listening, between whiles, for any sound in the
 room above. I had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit, but
 how strange it was to me now, to miss Mr. Barkis out of the kitchen !
     " This is very kind of you, Mas'r Davy," said Mr. Peggotty.
     " I t is oncommon kind," said Ham.
     " Em'ly, my dear," cried &fr. Peggotty.     " See here ! Here 's Mas'r
 Davy come ! What, cheer up, pretty ! Not a wured to Mas'r Davy ? "
    There was a trembling upon her, that I can see now. The coldness of
 her hand when I touched it, I can feel yet. I t s only sign of animation
 was to shrink from mine ; and then she glided from the chair, and, creeping
 to the other side of her uncle, bowed herself, silently and trembling still,
upon his breast.
    " I t 's such a loving art," said Mr. Peggotty, smoothing her rich hair
with his great hard hand, "that it can't abear the sorrer of this. I t ' s
nat'ral in young folk, Mas'r Davy, when they're new to these here trials,
 and timid, like my little bird,-it 's nat'ral."
    She clung the closer to him, but neither lifted up her face, nor spoke a
word.
    " I t 's getting late, my dear," said Mr. Peggotty, "and here 's Ham
 come fur to take you home. Theer ! Go along with t' other loving art !
 What, Em'ly ? Eh, my pretty ? "
    The sound of her voice had not reached me, but he bent his head as if
 he listened to her, and then said :
    "Let you stay with your uncle? Why, you doen't mean to ask me
 that ! Stay with your uncle, Moppet? When your husband that 1' 1 be so
 soon, is here fur to take you home? Now a person wouldn't think it, fur
 to see this little thing alongside a rough-weather chap like me," said Mr.
Peggotty, looking round at both of us, with infinite pride ; " but the sea
ain't more salt in it than she has fondness in her for her uncle-a foolish
little Em'ly ! "
    "Em'ly 's in the right in that, Mas'r Davy ! " said Ham. " Lookee
here ! As Em'ly wishes of it, and as she 's hurried and frightened, like,
besides, I 1' 1 leave her till morning. Let me stay too ! "
    "No, no," said Mr. Peggotty. " You doen't ought-a married man
like you-or what's as good-to take and hull away a day's work. And
you doen't ought to watch and work both. That won't do. You go
home and turn in. You ain't afeerd of Em'ly not being took good care
on, I know."
    Ham yielded to this persuasion, and took his hat to go. Even when he
kissed her,-and I never saw him approach her, but I felt that nature had
given him the soul of a gentleman,-she seemed to cling closer to her
uncle, even to the avoidance of her chosen husband. I shut the door
after him, that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that prevailed;
and when I turned back, I found Mr. Peggotty still talking to her.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           313
   "Now, I ' m a going up-stairs to tell your aunt as Mas'r Davy 's here,
and that '11 cheer her up a bit," he said. " Sit ye down by the fire, the
while, my dear, and warm these mortal cold hands. You doen't need to
be so fearsome, and take on so much. What ? You'll go along with me?
-Well ! come along with me-come ! If her uncle was turned out of
house and home, and forced to lay down in a dyke, Mas'r Davy," said
Mr. Peggotty, with no less pride than before, "it's my belief she 'd go
along with him, now ! But there '11 be some one else, soon,-some one
else, soon, Em'ly ! "
   Afterwards, when I went up-stairs, as I passed the door of my little
chamber, which was dark, I had an indistinct impression of her being
within it, cast down upon the floor. But, whether it was really she, or
whether it was a confusion of the shadows in the room, I don't know now.
   I had leisu~eto think, before the kitchen-fire, of pretty little Em'ly's
dread of death-which, added to what Mr. Omer had told me, I took to
be the cause of her being so unlike herself-and I had leisure, before
Peggotty came down, even to think more leniently of the weakness of it :
as I sat counting the ticking of the clock, and deepening my sense of the
solemn hush around me. Peggotty took me in her arms, and blessed and
thanked ine over and over again for being such a comfort to her (that was
what she said) in her distress. She then entreated me to come up-stairs,
sobbing that Mr. Barkis had always liked me and admired me; that he
had often talked of me, before he fell into a stupor ; and that she believed,
in case of his coming to himself again, he would brighten up at sight of
me, if he could brighten up at any earthly thing.
   The probability of his ever doing so, appeared to me, when I saw him,
to be very small. He was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed,
in an uncomfortable attitude, half resting on the box which had cost him
so much pain and trouble. I learned, that, when he was past creeping out
of bed to open it, and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the
divining rod I had seen him use, he had required to have it placed on the
chair at the bed-side, where he had ever since embraced it, night and day.
His arm lay on it now. Time and the world were slipping from beneath
him, but the box was there ; and the last words he had uttered were (in
an explanatory tone) " Old clothes ! "
   " Barkis, my dear ! " said Peggotty, almost cheerfully : bending over
him, while her brother and I stood at the bed's foot. " Here's my dear
boy-my dear boy, Master Davy, who brought us together, Barkis ! That
you sent messages by, you know ! Won't you speak to Master Davy ? "
   H e was as mute and senseless as the box, from which his form derived
the only expression it had.
   " H e 's a going out with the tide," said Mr. Peggotty to me, behind
his hand.
   My eyes were dim, and so were Mr. Peggotty's ; but I repeated in a
whisper, " With the tide ? "
   " People can't die, along the coast," said Mr. Peggotty, " except when

the tide's pretty nigh out. They can't be born, unless it's pretty nigh in-
not properly born, till flood. He 's a going out with the tide. I t ' s ebb at
half arter three, slack water half-an-hour. If he lives 'till it turns, he '11
hold his own till past the flood, and go out with the next tide."
314           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIESCE

   We remained there, watching him, a long time-hours.       What mysteri-
ous influence my presence had upon him in that state of his senses, I shall
not pretend to say; but when he at last began to wander feebly, it is
certain he was muttering about driving me to school.
   "He's coming to himself," said Peggotty.
   Mr. Peggotty touched me, and whispered with much awe and reverence,
"They are both a going out fast."
   " Barkis, my dear ! " said Peggotty.

   " C. P. Barkis," he cried, faintly, "No better woman anywhere !"
   "Look ! Here's Master Davy ! " said Peggotty. For he now opened
his eyes.
   I was on the point of asking him if he knew me, when he tried to
stretch out his arm, and said to me, distinctly, with a pleasant smile :
   " Barkis is rvillin' ! "

   And, it being low water, he went out with the tide.




                          CHBPTXR XXXI.
                            A GREATER LOSS,

   ITwas not difficult for me, on Peggotty's solicitation, to resolve to stay
where I was, until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made
their last journey to Blunderstone. She had long ago bought, out of her
own savings, a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave
"of her sweet girl," as she always called my mother ; and there they mere
to rest.
   I n keeping Peggotty company, and doing all I could for her (little
enough at the utmost), I was as grateful, I rejoice to think, as even now 1
could wish myself to have been. But I am afraid I had a supreme
satisfaction, of a personal and professional nature, in taking charge of
Mr. Barkis's will, and expounding its contents.
   I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will
should be looked for in the box. After some search, it was found in the
box, at the bottom of a horse's nose-bag ; wherein (besides hay) there was
discovered an old gold watch, with chain and seals, which Mr. Barkis had
worn on his wedding-day, and which had never been seen before or since ;
a silver tobacco-stopper, in the form of a leg ; an imitation lemon, full of
minute cups and saucers, which I have some idea Mr. Barkis must have
purchased to present to me when I was a child, and afterwards found
himself unable to part with ; eighty-seven guineas and a half, in guineas
and half guineas ; two hundred and ten pounds, in perfectly clean Bank
notes; certain receipts for Bank of England stock; an old horse-shoe, a
bad shilling, a piece of camphor, and an oyster-shell. Prom the circum-
stance of the latter article having been much polished, and displaying
prismatic colours on the inside, I conclude that Mr. Barkis had some
                          OF DAVID COPPERBIELD.                            315
general ideas about pearls, which never resolved themselves into anything
definite.
    For years and years, Mr. Barkis had carried this box, on all his journeys,
every day. That it might the better escape notice, he had invented a
fiction that it belonged to " Mr. Blackboy," and was " t o be left with
Barkis till called for ;" a fable he had elaborately written on the lid, in
characters now scarcely legible.
    H e had hoarded, all these years, I found, to good purpose. His property
in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds. Of this he be-
queathed the interest of one thousand to Mr. Peggotty for his life ; on his
decease, the principal io be equally divided between Peggotty, little Emily,
and me, or the survivor or survivors of us, share and share alike. All
the rest he died possessed of, he bequeathed to Peggotty ; whom he left
residuary legatee, and sole executrix of that his last will and testament.
    I felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all
possible ceremony, and set forth its provisions, any number of times, to
those whom they concerned. I began to think there was more in the
Commons than I had supposed. I examined the will with the deepest
attention, pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects, made a pencil-
mark or so in the margin, and thought it rather extraordinary that I knew
so much.
    I n this abstruse pursuit; in making an account for, Peggotty, of all the
property into which she had come; in arranging all the affairs in an
orderly manner ; and in being her referee and adviser on every point, to
our joint delight; I passed the week before the funeral. I did not see
little Emily in that interval, but they told me she was to be quietly
                                                                 -     - married
in a fortnight.
    I did not attend the funeral in character, if I may venture to say so.
I mean I was not dressed up in a black cloak and a streamer, to frighten
the birds; but I walked over to Blunderstone early in the morning,
and was in the churchyard when it came, attended only by Peggotty and
her brother. The mad gentleman looked on, out of my little window;
Mr. Chillip's baby wagged its heavy head, and rolled its goggle eyes, at
the clergyman, over its nurse's shoulder ; Mr. Omer breathed short in the
background ; no one else was there ; and it was very quiet. We walked
about the churchvard for an hour. after all was over : and nulled some
young leaves from the tree above my mother's grave.
    A dread falls on me here. A cloud is lowering on the distant town,
towards which I retraced my solitary steps. I fear to approach it. I cannot
bear to think of what did come, upon that memorable night; of what must
come again, if I go on.
    I t is no worse, because I write of it. I t would be no better, if I stopped
my most unwilling hand. I t is done. Nothing can undo i t ; nothing can
make it otherwise than as it was.
    My old nurse was to go to London with me next day, on the business
of the will. Little Eniily was passing that day at Mr. Omer's. We were
all to meet in the old boathouse that night. Ham would bring Emily at
the usual hour. I would walk back at my leisare. The brother and sister
would return as they had come, and be expecting us, when the day closed
in, at the fireside.
316           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   I parted from them at the wicket-gate, where visionary Straps had
rested with Roderick Random's knapsack in the days of yore ; and, instead of
going straight back, walked a little distance on the road to Lowestoft. Then
I turned, and walked back towards Yarmouth. I stayed to dine at a decent
alehouse, some mile or two from the Ferry I have mentioned before ; and
thus the day wore away, and it was evening when I reached it. Rain was
falling heavily by that time, and it was a wild night ; but there was a moon
behind the clouds, and it was not dark.
    I was soon within sight of Mr. Peggotty's house, and of the light
within it shining through the window. A little floundering across the
sand, which was heavy, brought me to the door, and I went in.
    I t looked very comfortable, indeed. Mr. Peggotty had smoked his
evening pipe, and there were preparations for some supper by-and-by.
The fire was bright, the ashes mere thrown up, the locker was ready for
little Emily in her old place. I n her own old place sat Peggotty, once
more, looking (but for her dress) as if she had never left it. She had fallen
back, already, on the society of the work-box with Saint Paul's upon the
lid, the yard-measure in the cottage, and the bit of wax candle : and there
they all were, just as if they had never been disturbed. Mrs. Gummidge
appeared to be fretting a little, in her old corner; and consequently looked
quite natural, too.
    " You're    first of the lot, Mas'r Davy !" said Mr. Peggotty, with a
happy face. " Doen't keep in that coat, sir, if it's wet."
    " Thank you, Mr. Peggotty," said I, giving him my outer coat to hang

        " It's quite dry."

UP'' So 'tis !" said Mr. Peggotty, feeling my shoulders.         '' As a chip !
Sit ye down, sir. I t ain't o' no use saying welcome to you, but you're
welcome, kind and hearty."
    " Thank you, Mr. Peggotty, I am sure of that. Well, Peggotty! " said
 I, giving her a kiss. " And how are you, old woman?"
    " Ha, ha ! " laughed Mr. Peggotty, sitting down beside us, and rubbing
his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble, and in the genuine
heartiness of his nature ; " there's not a woman in the wureld, sir-as
I tell her-that need to feel more easy in her mind than her ! She done
her dooty by the departed, and the departed know'd it ; and the departed
done what was right by her, as she done what was right by the departed;
and-and-and         it's all right ! "
    Mrs. Gummidge groaned.
    " Cheer up, my pretty mawther !" said Mr. Peggotty. (But he shook his
head aside at us, evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences
to recal the memory of the old one.) " Doen't be down ! Cheer up, for
your own self, on'y a little bit, and see if a good deal more doen't come
nat'ral ! "
    "Not to me, Dan'l," returned Mrs. Gummidge. " Nothink's nat'ral to
me but to be lone and lorn."
    "No, no," said Mr. Peggotty, soothing her sorrows.
    " Yes, yes, Dan'l ! " said Mrs. Gummidge. " I ain't a person to live
 with them as has had money left. Thinks go too contrairy with me. I
 had better be a riddance."
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           317
    " Why, how should I ever spend it without you ? " said Mr. Peggotty,
with an air of serious remonstrance. "What are you a talking on?
Doen't I want you more now, than ever I did ? "
    " I know'd I was never wanted before ! " cried Mrs. Gummidge, with a
pitiable whimper, " and now I 'm told so ! How could I expect to be
wanted, being so lone and lorn, and so contrairy ! "
    Mr. Peggotty seemed very much shocked at himself for having made a
speech capable of this unfeeling construction, but was prevented from
replying, by Peggotty's pulling his sleeve, and shaking her head. After
looking at Mrs. Gummidge for some moments, in sore distress of mind,
he glanced at the Dutch clock, rose, snuffed the candle, and put it in the
window.
    " Theer ! " said Mr. Peggotty, cheerily.     "Theer we are, Missis Gum-
midge ! " Mrs. Gummidge slightly groaned. " Lighted up, accordin' to
custom ! You 're a wonderin' what that 's fur, sir ! Well, it's fur our
little Em'ly. You see, the path ain't over light or cheerful arter dark;
and when I 'm here at the hour as she's a comin' home, I puts the light in
the winder. That, you see," said Mr. Peggotty, bending over me with
great glee, "meets two objects. She says, says Em'ly, ' Theer 's home ! '
she says. And likewise, says Em'ly, ' My uncle 's theer ! ' Fur if I ain't
theer, I never have no light showed."
    "You're a baby! " said Peggotty ; very fond of him for it, if she
thought so.
    "Well," returned Mr. Peggotty, standing with his legs pretty wide
apart, and rubbing his hands up and down them in his comfortable satis-
faction, as he looked alternately at us and at the fire, " I doen't know but
I am. Not, you see, to look at."
    " Not azackly," observed Peggotty.

    "No," laughed Mr. Peggotty, "not to look at, but to-to consider on,
 you know. I doen't care, bless you ! Now I tell you. When I go a looking
 and looking about that theer pritty house of our Em'ly's, I 'm-I 'm
 Gormed," said Mr. Peggotty, with sudden emphasis-" theer ! I can't say
more-if I doen't feel as if the littlest things was her, a'most. I takes 'em up
 and I puts 'em down, and I touches of 'em as delicate as if they was our
 Em'ly. So 'tis with her little bonnets and that. I couldn't see one on
 'em rough used a purpose-not fur the whole wureld. There 's a babby
 fur you, in the form of a great Sea Porkypine ! " said Mr. Peggotty,
 relieving his earnestness with a roar of laughter.
    Peggotty and I both laughed, but not so loud.
    " I t ' s my opinion, you see," said Mr. Peggotty, with a delighted face,

 after some further rubbing of his legs, "as this is along of my havin'
 played with her so much, and made believe as we was Turks, and French,
 and sharks, and every wariety of forinners-bless you, yes ; and lions and
 whales, and I don't know what all!-when she ~varn'tno higher than my
 knee. I've got into the way on it, yon know. Why, this here candle,
 now ! " said Mr. Peggotty, gleefully holding out his hand towards it, " I
 know wery well that arter she's married and gone, I shall put that candle
 theer, just the same as now. I know wery well that when I 'm here o'
  nights (and where else should I live, bless your arts, whatever fortun' I
318           THE PERSONAL HISTORY ANT) EXPERIENCE

come into !) and she ain't here, or I ain't theer, I shall put the candle in
the winder, and sit afore the fire, pretending I 'm expecting of her, like I 'm
a doing now. There's a babby for you," said Mr. Peggotty, with another
roar, "in the form of a Sea Porkypine ! Why, at the present minute,
when I see the candle sparkle up, I says to myself, ' She 's a looking at it !
Em'ly 's a coming ! ' There's a babby for you, in the form of a Sea
Porkypine ! Right for all that," said Mr. 'eggotty, stopping in his roar,
and smiting his hands together ; " fur here she is ! "
   I t was only Ham. The night should have turned more wet since I
came in, for he had a large sou'wester hat on, slouched over his face.
   " Where 's Em'ly? " said Mr. Peggotty.

   Ham made a motion with his head, as if she were outside. Mr. Peggotty
took the light from the window, trimmed it, put it on the table, and was
busily stirring the fire, when Ham, who had not moved, said :
   " Mas'r Davy, will you come out a minute, and see what Em'ly and me
has got to show you? "
   We went out. As I passed him at the door, I saw, to my astonishment
and fright, that he mas deadly pale. H e pushed me hastily into the open
air, and closed the door upon us. Only upon us two.
   " Ham ! what 's the matter !"
   " Mas'r Davy !-"       Oh, for his broken heart, how dreadfully he wept !
   I was paralyzed by the sight of such grief. I don't know what I
thought, or what I dreaded. I could only look at him.
   " Ham !     Poor good fellow ! For Heaven's sake tell me what's the
matter !JJ




   " My love, Mas'r Davy-the        pride and hope of my art-her     that I 'd
have died for, and would die for now-she 's gone ! "
   " Gone ? "

    " Em'ly 's run away !   Oh, Mas'r Davy, think how she's run away, when
I pray my good and gracious God to kill her (her that is so dear above all
things) sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace ! "
   The face he turned up to the troubled sky, the quivering of his clasped
hands, the agony of his figure, remain associated with that lonely waste, in
my remembrance, to this hour. I t is always night there, and he is the
only object in the scene.
    "You 're a scholar," he said, hurriedly, " and know what 's right and
best. What am I to say, in-doors ? How am I ever to break it to him,
Mas'r Davy ? "
   I saw the door move, and instinctively tried to hold the latch on the
outside, to gain a moment's time. I t was too late. Mr. Peggotty thrust
forth his face; and never could I forget the change that came upon it
when he saw us. if I were to live five h~uldredvears.
    I remember a great wail and cry, and the women hanging about him,
and we all standing in the room ; I with a paper in my hand, which Ham
 had given me ; Mr. Peggotty, with his vest torn open, his hair wild, his
face and lips quite white, and blood trickling down his bosom (it had
 sprung from his mouth, I think), looking fixedly at me.
    " Read it, sir," he said, in a low shivering voice.     " Slow, please. I
 doen't know as I can understand."
                           OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                               319
  I n the midst of the silence of death, I read thus, from a blotted letter.
   "6 When you, who love me so much better than I ever have deserved, even

  when my mind was innocent, see this, I shall be far away.' "

  ' r I shall be fur away," he repeated slo~vljr. " Stop ! Em'ly fur away.
TLTell! "
     When I leave my dear home-my         dear home-oh,    my dear home !-in    the
  morning;'

the letter bore date on the previous night:
    '-it   will be never to come back, unless he brings me back a lady. This will
  be found at night, many hours after, instead of me. Oh, if you knew how my
  heart is torn. If even you, that I have wronged so much, that never can forgive
  me, could only know what I suffer! I am too wicked to write about myself.
  Oh, take comfort in thinking that I a m so bad. Oh, for mercy's sake, tell uncle
  that I never loved him half so dear as now. Oh, don't remember how atiectionate
  and kind you have all been to me-don't     remember we were ever to be married
  -but try to think as if I died when I was little, and was buried somewhere. Pray
  Heaven that I a m going away fi-om, have compassion on my uncle ! Tell him
  that I never loved him half so dear. Be his comfort. Love some good girl, that
  will be what I was once to uncle, and be true to you, and worthy of you, and know
  no shame but me. God bless all ! I 1' 1 pray for all, often, on my knees. If he
  don't bring me back a lady, and I don't pray for my own self, I 1' 1 pray for all.
  My parting love to uncle. My last tears, and m y last thanks, for uncle !' "

   That was all.
   H e stood, long after I had ceased to read, still looking at me. At
length I ventured to take his hand, and to entreat him, as well as I could,
to endeavour to get some command of himself. H e replied, " I thankee,
sir, I thankee ! " without moving.
   Ham spoke to him. Mr. Peggotty was so far sensible of his affliction,
that he wrung his hand; bat, otherwise, he remained in the same state,
and no one dared to disturb him.
   Slowly, at last, he moved his eyes from my face, as if he were waking
from a vision, and cast them round the room. Then he said, in a low
voice :
   " Who 's the man?     I want to know his name."
   Ham glanced at me, and suddenly I felt a shock that struck me back.
    " There 's a man suspected," said Mr. Peggotty.  "Who is it ? "
   " &1asyrDavy ! " implored Ham. " Go out a bit, and let me tell him
what I must. You doen't ought to hear it, sir."
   I felt the shock again. I sank down in a chair, and tried to utter some
reply; but my tongue was fettered, and my sight was weak.
   " I want to know his name ! " I heard said, once more.

   " For some time past," Ham faltered, "there's been a servant about
here, at odd times. There's been a gen'lm'n too. Both of 'em belonged
to one another."
   Mr. Peggotty stood fixed as before, but now looking at him.
   "The servant," pursued Ham, "was seen along with-our poor girl-
last night. He's been in hiding about here, this week or over. He was
320            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 thought to have gone, but he was hiding. Doen't stay, Mas'r Davy,
 doen't ! "
      I felt Peggotty's arm round my neck, but I could not have moved if the
 house had been about to fall upon me.
      " A strange chay and horses was outside town, this morning, on the

 Norwich road, a'most afore the day broke," Ham went on. " The
 servant went to it, and come from it, and went to it again. When he
 went to it again, Em'ly was nigh him. The t'other u-as inside. He's
 the man."
      "For the Lord's love," said Mr. Peggotty, falling back, and putting out
 his hand, as if to keep off what he dreaded. " Doen't tell me his name's
 Steerforth ! "
      " Mas'r Davy," exclaimed Ham, in a broken voice, "it ain't no fault of

 yourn-and I a m far from layingof it to yon-but his name is Steerforth,
 and he 's a damned villain ! "
      Mr. Peggotty uttered no cry, and shed no tear, and moved no more,
 until he seemed to wake again, all at once, and pulled dorvn his rough
 coat from its peg in a corner.
      " Bear a hand with this !  I ' m struck of a heap, and can't do it," he
said, impatiently. " Bear a hand, and help me. Well ! " when somebody
had done so. "Now give me that theer hat ! "
      Ham asked him whither he was going.
      " I 'm a going to seek my niece.      I ' m a going to seek my Em'ly.
I ' m a going, first, to stave in that theer boat, and sink it where I would
have drownded him, as I ' m a livin' soul, if I had had one thought of
what was in him ! As he sat afore me," he said, wildly, holding out his
clenched right hand, " as he sat afore me, face to face, strike me down
dead, but I 'd have drownded him, and thought it right !-I 'm a going to
seek my niece."
      " Where ? " cried Ham, interposing himself before the door.

      " Anywhere ! I 'm a going to seek my niece through the wureld. I 'm
a going to find my poor niece in her shame, and bring her back. No one
stop me ! I tell you I 'm a going to seek my niece ! "
      " No, no ! " cried Mrs. Gummidge, coming between them, in a fit of
crying. "No, no, Dan'l, not as you are now. Seek her in a llttle while,
my lone lorn Dan'i, and that '11 be but right ; but not as you are now.
Sit ye down, and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit
to you, Dan'l-what have ray contrairies ever been to this !-and let us
speak a word about them times when she was first an orphan, and when
Ilam was too, and when I was a poor widder woman, and you took me in.
I t 1' 1 soften your poor heart, Dan'l," laying her head upon his shoulder,
" and you'll bear your sorrow better; for you know the promise, Dan'l,

'As you have done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto
me ' ; and that can never fail under this roof, that 's been our shelter for
so many, many year ! "
    I-Ie was quite passive now ; and when I heard him crying, the impulse
that had been upon me to go down upon my knees, and ask their pardon
for the desolation I had caused, and curse Steerforth, yielded to a better
feeling. My overcharged heart found the same relief, and I cried too.

      Warranted of the very best material.               Samples will be sent free, upon a ~ l i c a t i o n .
     The following extracts from the "Art Union," and "Magazine of Science," will be sufficient
guarantee of the excellent quality of these papers, and the great celebrity to which they have attained :
    Art Union.-"Messrs. Waterlow and Sons' Tracing Paper is certainly the best we have ever tried, being per-
fectly transparent, though sufficientlythick for all practical purposes, and perfectly free from that oiliness we
generally meet with in paper of a similar description, taking the ink as readily as ordinary writing paper. I t
must be invaluable to all who require the use of such an article!'
    Magazine of Science.-" To those very numerous classes of the public-artists, architects,engineers, map-makers
pattern-drawers-indeed to all who, whether professionallyor otherwise, have occasion to employ tracingpape~
we would, with earnestness, urge the extreme worth and merits of that manufactured by Messrs. Waterlow and
Sons. In happy contrast to the paper of a like nature, too frequently to be met with, theirs is entirely devoid of
all nasty, unclean greasiness; it is thoroughly transparent, and can be traced over either by the pencil, or-a great
desideratum-by pen and ink. Assuredly this is a very admirable article."

   The increasing demand for these Presses, and the great satisfaction which they have universally
given, have induced us to manufacture a large stork of the most useful sizes; we are therefore
enabled to offer them at much lower prices than heretofore ; the large sale which they have met with
has convinced us of the impolicy of endeavouring to maintain the old and extravagant scale of prices
charged at a time when it was the exception, instead of as at present the rule, for every Counting-
house or Gentleman's Library to be furnished witli a Copying Machine. These Machines, although
lower i n price than those o f a n y other manufacturer, are all warranted, and will be immediately
exchanged, or the money returned, if any fault is discovered.

                            THE WINTER OF 1814.

Two neighhours, meeting, talk'd about the cold,                 Which roasted a stupendous ox entire.
The one was young, and one was rather old.                      It was a most excltlng scene to qulz! "
"Good morning ( s a ~ dthe young one-Mr. Phizz,)                " So I should think" (sald Mr. P h ~ l ~Phizz).
                                                                                                         p
What's the best news? How cold the weather is ! ''              "Ah ! (said hls ft~end,addressing him again,)
"Yes (said the other,) it is rather cold.                       We'd not the benefit of MOSES'then;
But nothing likeit was in times of old.'                        How well would Mosas' winter coats have sold
This winter's not a fifteenth part so keen                      In such a season's memorable cold.
As that which happen'd in the year 'Fourteen j                  Many poor creatures suffered most severely
'Twas then the river Thames was frozen o'er,                    Through wlnter cloth~ugbelng sold so dearly.
While people pass'd on foot from shore to shore.                MOSESand SONwould certainly have been
The ships were all in icy fetters pinn'd,                       Of vast advantage in the year 'Fourteen.
Unable to be moved by tide or wind.                             But never mind ! we've got these tradesmen now,
Talk of cold wlnters ! that was one, I own,                     And that's a famous thing, you must allow.
'Twonld scarcely have disgraced the Frigid Zone.                I've just now been an over-coat to buy; "
Large fairs were held on Thames's icy floor,                    "Indeed (repl~edthe other,) so have I."
Throng'd by enormous crowds; and, what is more,                 Much more was sald by each, as you'll suppose,
Upon the ice was lit a 'furnace-fire'                           But, as I 've no more space my lines must close.

               EDITED BY DR. LINDLEY AND JOSEPH PAXTON.
AND I L L U S T R A T E D BY H I G H L Y F I N I S H E D PLATES AND WOODCUTS.

   Thiswork, for which hlonsieur CONSTANS,      a French Botanical Draughtsn~anof great taste and skill,
and a pupil of Mans. Decaisne, has been expressly engaged, will be confined to the proper business of
an illustrated book, namely the representation and description of all new plants which inay appear
in gardens. The species which are of most importance will be illustrated by coloured plates, one
species or genus only to a plate, with a leaf or more of letter-press, explaining the principal
scientific and horticultural facts which belong to each plant. The species of less importance will
be treated of more briefly, and will be illustrated when necessary by copious woodcuts and
vignettes. The object, in short, will be to combine Scientific Botany with Gardening, and exact
delineations of plants with pictorial effect. I t is believed that by such means this periodical will
not only be indispensable to the BOTANIST     and GARDENER,    but be also amine of invaluable hints by
which the ARTISTand MANUFACTURER         \\.ill be able to profit.
   I t is not intended to admit any other kind of matter than such as is now described. All special
treatises on cultivation, and all disquisitions respecting subjects incidental to gardening will be
transferred to the Gardeners' C7~ronicleand similar periodicals, in which there is ample space for
such discussions, and to which they have now become better adapted than to a pictorial work.

                            It will be perfectly plain, and much larger than
                            those worn last year, and, instead of being
                            fringed as formerly, it will be finished in a pe-
                            culiar style at once novel and elegant. These
                            Parasols will be extremely light, and very mo-

                           CHAPTER XXXII.
                 THE B E G I N N I N G O F A L O N e JOURNEY.

  WHATis natural in me, is natural in many other men, I infer, and so
I am not afraid to write that I never had loved Steerforth better than
when the ties that bound me to him were broken. I n the keen distress of
the discovery of his unworthiness, I thought more of all that was brilliant
in him, I softened more towards all that was good in him, I did more
justice to the qualities that might have made him a man of a noble nature
and a great name, than ever I had done in the height of my devotion to
him. Deeply as I felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of
an honest home, I believe that if I had been brought face to face with him,
I could not have uttered one reproach. I should have loved him so well
still-though he fascinated me no longer-I should have held in so much
tenderness the memory of my affection for him, that I think I should
have been as weak as a spirit-wounded child, in all but the entertainment
of a thought that we could ever be re-united. That thought I never had.
I felt, as he had felt, that all was at an end between us. What his
remembrances of me were, I have never known-they were light enough,
perhaps, and easily dismissed-but mine of him were as the remem-
brances of a cherished friend, who was dead.
     Yes, Steerforth, long removed from the scenes of this poor history ! My
sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the Judgment Throne;
but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will, I know !
     The news of what had happened soon spread through the town; inso-
much that as I passed along the streets next morning, I overheard the
people speaking of it at their doors. Many were hard upon her, some
few were hard upon him, but towards her second father and her lover there
was but one sentiment. Among all kinds of people a respect for them in
their distress prevailed, which was full of gentleness and delicacy. The
seafaring men kept apart, when those two were seen early, walking with
 slow steps on the beach; and stood in knots, talking compassionately
 among tiiemselves.
     I t was on the beach, close down by the sea, that I found them. I t
 would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night, even
 if Peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as I left them,
 when it was broad day. They looked worn; and I thought Mr. Peggotty's
 head was bowed in one night more than in all the years I had known
 him. But they were both as grave and steady as the sea itself: then
 lying beneath a dark sky, waveless-yet with a heavy roll upon it, as if
 it breathed in its rest-and touched, on the horizon, with a strip of silvery
  light from the unseen sun.
     "We have had a mort of talk, sir," said Mr. Peggotty to me, when we
                                                                 Y
322           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

had all three walked a little while in silence, "of what we ought and
doen't ought to do. But we see our course now."
    I happened to glance at Ham, then looking out to sea upon the distant
light, and a frightful thought came into my mind-not that his face was
angry, for it was not; I recal nothing but an expression of stern
detertnination in it-that      if ever he encountered Steerforth, he would
kill him.
    " My dooty here, sir," said Mr. Peggotty, " is done. I 'm a going to
seek my-"      he stopped, and went on in a firmer voice : "I'm a going to
seek her. That's my dooty evermore."
    H e shook his head when I asked him where he would seek her, and
inquired if I were going to London to-morrow? I told him I had not
gone to-day, fearing to lose the chance of being of any service to him; but
that I was ready to go when he would.
    " I '11 go along with you, sir," he rejoined, "if you 're agreeable,
to-morrow."
   We walked again, for a while, in silence.
    " Ham," he presently resumed, "he '11 hold to his present work, and go
and live along with my sister. The old boat yonder-"
    "Will you desert the old boat, Mr. Peggotty? " I gently interposed.
    " My station, Mas'r Davy," he returned, " ain't there no longer ; and if
ever a boat foundered, since there was darkness on the face of the deep,
that one's gone down. But no, sir, no; I doen't mean as it should be
deserted. Fur from that."
    We walked again for a while, as before, until he explained :
    " My wishes is, sir, as it shall look, day and night, winter and summer,
as it has always looked, since she first know'd it. If ever she should
come a wandering back, I wouldn't have the old place seem to cast her off,
you understand, but seem to tempt her to draw nigher to 't, and to peep
in, maybe, like a ghost, out of the wind and rain, through the old winder
at the old seat by the fire. Then, maybe, Mas'r Davy, seein' none but
Missis Gummidge there, she might take heart to creep in, trembling ; and
might come to be laid down in her old bed, and rest her weary head where
it was once so gay."
    I could not speak to him in reply, though I tried.
    <' Every night," said Mr. Peggotty, "as reg'lar as the night comes, the
candle must be stood in its old pane of glass, that if ever she should see
it, it may seem to say ' Come back, my child, come back ! ' If ever
there's a knock, Ham (partic'ler a soft knock), arter dark, at your aunt's
door, doen't you go nigh it. Let it be her-not you-that sees my
fallen child ! "
    H e walked a little in front of us, and kept before us for some minutes.
During this interval, I glanced at Ham again, and observing the same
expression on his face, and his eyes still directed to the distant light, I
touched his arm.
    Twice I called him by his name, in the tone in which I might have
tried to rouse a sleeper, before he heeded me. When I at last inquired
on what his thoughts were so bent, he replied :
    " On what's afore me, Mas'r Davy ; and over yon."
    " On the life before you, do you mean ? " H e had pointed confusedly
 out to sea.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            323
      "Ay, Mas'r Davy. I doen't rightly know how 'tis, but from over
  yon there seemed to me to come-the       end of it like ;" looking at me as
  if he were waking, but with the same determined face.
      " What end ? " I asked, possessed by my former fear.

      " I doen't know," he said thoughtfully ; " I was calling to mind that the
  beginning of it all did take place here-and then the end come. But it's
 gone ! Mas'r Davy," he added ; answering, as I think, my look ; "you
 han't no call to be afeerd of me: but I ' m kiender muddled; I doen't
 fare to feel no matters,"-which     was as much as to say that he was not
 himself, and q u ~ t econfounded.
     Mr. Peggotty stopping for us to join him: we did so, and said no
 more. The remembrance of this, in connexion with my former thought,
 however, haunted me at intervals, even until the inexorable end came at
 its appointed time.
     We insensibly approached the old boat, and entered. Mrs. Gummidge,
 no longer moping in her especial corner, was busy preparing breakfast.
 She took Mr. Peggotty's hat, and placed his seat for him, and spoke so
 comfortably and softly, that I hardly knew her.
     "Dan'l, my good man," said she, "you must eat and drink, and keep
 up your strength, for without it you'll do nowt. Try, that's a dear soul!
 And if I disturb you with my clicketten," she meant her chattering, " tell
 me so, Dan'l, and I won't."
     When she had served us all, she withdrew to the window, where she
sedulously emplojied herself in repairing some shirts and other clothes
belonging to Mr. Peggotty, and neatly folding and packing them in an old
oilskin bag, such as sailors carry. Meanwhile, she continued talking, in
the same quiet manner :
     " All times and seasons, you know, Dan'l,"     said Mrs. Gummidge, " I
shall be allus here, and every think will look accordin' to your wishes.
I ' m a poor scholar, but I shall write to you, odd times, when yon 're away,
and send my letters to Mas'r Davy. Maybe you '11 write to me too,
Dan'l, odd times, and tell me how you fare to feel upon your lone lorn
journies."
     " You '11 be a solitary woman heer, I 'm afeerd ! " said Mr. Peggotty.
     '<No, no, Dan'l," she returned, " I shan't be that. Doen't you mind
 me. I shall have enough to do to keep a Beeiu for you" (Mrs. Gum-
 midge meant a home), " again you come back-to keep a Beein here for
 any that may hap to come back, Dan'l. I n the fine time, I shall set out-
 side the door as I used to do. If any should come nigh, they shall see
 the old widder woman true to 'em, a long way off."
     What a change in Mrs. Gummidge in a httle time ! She was another
 woman. She was so devoted, she had such a quick perception of
 what it would be well to say, and what it would be well to leave unsaid,
  she was so forgetful of herself, and so regardful of the sorrow about
 her, that I held her in a sort of veneration. The work she did that
  day ! There were many things to be brought up from the beach
  and stored i n the outhouse-as oars, nets, sails, cordage, spars, lobster-
  pots, bags of ballast, and the like ; and though there was abundance of
  assistance rendered, there being not a pair of working hands on all that
  shore but would have labored hard for Mr. Peggotty, and been well paid
                                                                 Y 2
3 24          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

in being asked to do it, yet she persisted, all day long, in toiling under
 weights that she was quite unequal to, and fagging to and fro on all sorts
 of unnecessary errands. As to deploring her misfortunes, she appeared to
have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any. She preserved
 an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy, which was not the
least astonishing part of the change that had come over her. Querulous-
ness was out of the question. I did not even observe her voice to
falter, or a tear to escape from her eyes, the whole day through, until
twilight; when she and I and Mr. Peggotty being alone together, and
he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion, she broke into a half-sup-
pressed fit of sobbing and crying, and taking me to the door, said,
" Ever bless you, Mas'r Davy, be a friend to him, poor dear ! "  Then, she
immediately ran out of the house to wash her face, in order that she might
sit quietly beside him, and be found at work there, when he should awake.
I n short I left her, when I went away at night, the prop and staff of
Mr. Peggotty's affliction; and I could not meditate enough upon the
lesson that I read in Mrs. Gummidge, and the new experience she un-
folded to me.
    I t was between nine and ten o'clock when, strolling in a melancholy
manner through the town, I stopped at Mr. Omer's door. Mr. Omer
had taken it so much to heart, his daughter told me, that he had been
very low and poorly all day, arid had gone to bed without his pipe.
    " A deceitful, bad-hearted girl,"   said Mrs. Joram. "There was no
good in her, ever ! "
    "Don't say so," I returned. " You don't think so."
    " Yes, I do ! " cried Mrs. Joram, angrily.
    " NO, no," said I.

    Mrs. Joram tossed her head, endeavouring to be very stern and
cross; but she could not command her softer self, and began to cry.
I was young, to be sure; but I thought much the better of her for this
sympathy, and fancied it became her, as a virtuous wife and mother, very
well indeed.
    " What will she ever do ! " sobbed Minnie. " Where will she go !
What will become of her! Oh, how could she be so cruel, to herself
and him ! "
    I remembered the time when Minnie was a young and pretty girl; and
I was glad that she remembered it too, so feelingly.
    " My little Minnie," said Mrs. Joram, "has only just now been got to

sleep. Even in her sleep she is sobbing for Em'ly. All day long, little
Minnie has cried for her, and asked me, over and over again, whether Em'ly
was wicked? What can I say to her, when Em'ly tied a ribbon off her
own neck round little Minnie's the last night she was here, and laid her
head down on the pillow beside her till she was fast asleep ! The ribbon 's
round my little Minnie's neck now. I t ought not to be, perhaps, but what
can I do ? Em'ly is very bad, but they were fond of one another. And
the child knows nothing ! "
    Mrs. Joram was so unhappy, that her husband came out to take care
of her. Leaving them together, I went home to Peggotty's ; more melan-
 choly myself, if possible, than I had been yet.
    That good creature-I mean Peggotty-all untired by her late anxieties
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          325
and sleepless nights, was at her brother's, where she meant to stay till
morning. An old woman, who had been employed about the house for
some weeks past, while Peggotty had been unable to attend to it, was
the house's only other occupant besides myself. As I had no occasion
for her services, I sent her to bed, by no means against her will;
and sat down before the kitchen fire a little while, to think about
all this.
   I was blending it with the deathbed of the late Mr. Barkis, and was
driving out with the tide towards tlie distance at which Ham had looked
 so singularly in the morning, when I was recalled from my wanderings by
 a knock at the door. There was a knocker upon the door, but it was not
 that which made the sound. The tap was from a hand, and low down
 upon the door, as if it were given by a child.
   I t made me start as much as if it had been the knock of a footman to
a person of distinction. I opened the door; and at first looked down, to
my amazement, on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be
walking about of itself. But presently I discovered underneath it, Miss
Mowcher.
    I might not have been prepared to give the little creature a very kind
reception, if, on her removing the umbrella, which her utmost efforts were
unable to shut up, she had shown me the "volatile" expression of face
which had made so great an impression on me at our first and last meeting.
But her face, as she turned it up to mine, was so earnest ; and when I
relieved her of the umbrella (which would have been an inconvenient one
for the Irish Giant), she wrung her little hands in such an afflicted manner;
that I rather inclined towards her.
    "Miss Mowcher !" said I, after glancing up and down the empty street,
without distinctly knowing what I expected to see besides; " how do
you come here? What is the matter ?"
   She motioned to me, with her short right arm, to shut the umbrella for
her; and passing me hurriedly, went into the kitchen. When I had closed
the door, and followed, with the umbrella in my hand, I found her
sitting on the corner of the fender-it was a low iron one, with two flat bars
at top to stand plates upon-in the shadow of the boiler, swaying herself
backwards and forwards, and chafing her hands upon her knees like a
person in pain.
   Quite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit, and
the only spectator of this portentous behaviour, I exclaimed again:
" Pray tell me, Miss Mowcher, what is tlie matter! are you ill?

   " My dear young soul," returned Miss hlowcher, squeezing her hands

upon her heart one over the other. " I am ill here, I am very ill. To
think that it should come to this, when I might have known it and perhaps
prevented it, if I hadn't been a thoughtless fool !"
   Again her large bonnet (very disproportionate to her figure) went
 backwards and forwards, in her swaying of her little body to and fro;
 while a most gigantic bonnet rocked, in unison with it, upon the wall.
    " I am surprised," 1 began, " to see you so distressed and serious"--

 when she interrupted me.
    " Yes, it's always so !" she said.      " They are all surprised, these
 inconsiderate young people, fairly and full grown, to see any natural
326           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

feeling in a little thing like me ! They make a plaything of me, use me
for their amusement, throw me away when they are tired, and wonder
that I feel more than a toy horse or a wooden soldier ! Yes, yes, that 's
the way. The old way ! "
    " I t may be, with others," I returned, " but I do assure you it is not
with me. Perhaps I ought not to be at all surprised to see you as you
are now: I know so little of you. I said, without consideration, what I
thought."
    " What can I do? " returned       the little woman, standing up, and
holding out her arms to show herself. " See ! What I am, my father was ;
and my sister is; and my brother is. I have worked for sister and brother
these many years-hard, Mr. Copperfield-all day. I must live. I do
no harm. If there are people so unreflecting or so cruel, as to make
a jest of me, what is left for me to do but to make a jest of myself,
them, and every thing? If I do so, for the time, whose fault is that?
Mine? "
    No. Not Miss Mowcher's, I perceived.
    " If I hacl shown myself a sensitive dwarf to your false friend," pursued

the little woman, shaking her head at me, with reproachful earnestness,
 " how much of his help or good will do you think I should ever have
 had? If little Mowcher (who had no hand, young gentleman, in the
making of herself) addressed herself to him, or the like of him, because of
 her misfortunes, when do you suppose her small voice would have been
 heard ? Little Mowcher would have as much need to live, if she was the
 bitterest and dullest of pigmies ; but she couldn't do it. No. She might
 whistle for her bread and butter till she died of Air ! "
    Miss Mowcher sat down on the fender again, and took out her hand-
 kerchief, and wiped her eyes.
    " Be thankful for me, if you have a kind heart as I think you have,"

 she said, "that while I know well what I am, I can be cheerful and endure
 it all. I am thankful for myself, at any rate, that I can find my tiny way
 through the world, without being beholden to any one; and that in return
 for all that is thrown at me, in folly or vanity, as I go along, I can throw
 bubbles back. If I don't brood over all I want, it is the better for me,
 and not the worse for any one. If I am a plaything for you giants, be
 gentle with me.
    Miss Mowcher replaced her handkerchief in her pocket, looking at me
 with very intent expression all the while, and pursued :
    " I saw you in the street just now.    You may suppose I am not able to
 walk as fast as you, with my short legs and short breath, and I couldn't
 overtake you; but I guessed where you came, and came after you. I
have been here before, to-day, but the good woman wasn't at home."
    " Do you know her? " I demanded.

    " I know of her, and about her," she replied, " from Omer and Joram.
 I was there at seven o'clock this morning. Do you remember what
 Steerforth said to me about this unfortunate girl, that time when I saw
 you both at the i n n ? "
    The great bonnet on Miss Mowcher's head, and the greater bonnet on
 the wall, began to go backwards and forwards again when she asked this
 question.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            327
    I remembered very well what she referred to, having had it in my
 thoughts many times that day. I told her so.
    " May the Father of all Evil confound him," said Che little woman,

 holding up her forefinger between me and her sparkling eyes, " and ten
times more confound that wicked servant; but I believed it was you who
had a boyish passion for her ! "
    " I ? " I repeated.
    " Child, chlld ! I n the name of blind ill-fortune," cried Miss Mowcher,
 wringing her hands impatiently, as she went to and fro again upon the
fender, " why did you praise her so, and blush, and look disturbed?"
    I could not conceal from myself that I had done this, though for a
reason very different from her supposition.
    "What did I know? " said Miss Mowcher, taking out her handkerchief
 again, and giving one little stamp on the ground whenever, at short inter-
vals, she applied it to her eyes with both hands at once. " He was crossing
you and wheedling you, I saw; and you were soft wax in his hands, I saw,
Had I left the room a minute, when his man told me that 'Young Inno-
cence ' (so he called you, and you may call him ' Old Guilt ' all the days
of your hfe) had set his heart upon her, and she was giddy and l~kedhim,
but his master was resolved that no harm should come of it-more for your
sake than for hers-and that that was their business here? How could I
but believe him? I saw Steerforth soothe and please you by his praise of
her! You were the first to niention her name. You owned to an old
admiration of her. You were hot and cold, and red and white, all at once
when I spoke to you of her. What could I think-what did I think-
but that you were a young libertine in everything but experience, and had
fallen into hands that had experience enough, and could manage you
(having the fancy) for your own good? Oh ! oh ! oh ! They were afraid
of my finding out the truth," exclaimed Miss Mowcher, getting off the
fender, and trotting up and down the kitchen with her two short arms
distressfully lifted up, " because I am a sharp little thing-I need be, to get
through the world at all!-and they deceived me altogether, and I gave
the poor unfortunate girl a letter, which I fully believe was the beginning
of her ever speaking to Littimer, who was left behind on purpose ! "
   I stood amazed at the revelation of all this perfidy, looking at Miss
Mowcher as she walked up and down the kitchen until she was out of
breath: when she sat upon the fender again, and, drying her face with her
handkerchief, shook her head for a long time, without otherwise moving,
and without breaking silence.
   " My country rounds," she added at length, " brought me to Norwich,

Mr. Copperfield, the night before last. What I happened to find out there,
about their secret way of coming and going, without you-which was
strange-led to my suspecting something wrong. I got into the coach
from London last night, as it came through Norwich, and was here this
morning. Oh, oh, oh ! too late ! "
   Poor little Mowcher turned so chilly after all her crying and fretting,
that she turned round on the fender, putting her poor l~ttlewet feet in
among the ashes to warm them, and sat looking at the fire, like a large
doll. I sat in a chair on the other side of the hearth, lost in unhappy
reflections, and looking at the fire too, and sometimes at her.
328          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " I must go," she said at last, rising as she spoke. "It's late. You
don't mistrust me ? "
    Meeting her sharp glance, which was as sharp as ever when she asked
me, I could not on that short challenge answer no, quite frankly.
    " Come ! " said she, accepting the offer of my hand to help her over the

fender, and looking wistfully up into my face, "you know you wouldn't
mistrust me, if I was a full-sized woman ! "
    I felt that there was much truth in this; and I felt rather ashamed
of myself.
    " You are a young man," she said, nodding. "Take a word of advice,
even from three foot nothing. Try not to associate bodily defects with
mental, my good friend, except for a solid reason."
    She had got over the fender now, and I had got over my suspicion. I
told her that I believed she had given me a faithful account of herself, and
that we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands. She
thanked me, and said I was a good fellow.
    " Now, mind ! " she exclaimed, turning back on her way to the door,
and looking shrewdly at me, with her forefinger up again. " I have
some reason to suspect, from what I have heard-my ears are always
open; I can't afford to spare what powers I have-that they are gone
abroad. But if ever they return, if ever any one of them returns, while I
am alive, I am more likely than another, going about as I do, to find it
out soon. Whatever I know, you shall know. If ever I can do anything
to serve the poor betrayed girl, I will do it faithfully, please Heaven !
And Littimer had better have a bloodhound at his back, than little
Mowcher ! "
    I placed implicit faith in this last statement, when I marked the look
with which it was accompanied.
    " Trust me no more, but trust me no less, than you would trust a full-

sized woman," said the little creature, touching me appealingly on the
wrist. " If ever you see me again, unlike what I am now, and like what
I was when you first saw me, observe what company I am in. Call
to mind that I am a very helpless and defenceless little thing. Think
of me at home with my brother like myself and sister like myself, when
my day's work is done. Perhaps you wont, then, be very hard upon me,
or surprised if I can be distressed and serious. Good nieht ! "
    I gave Miss Mowcher my hand, with avery different opinion of her from
that which I had hitherto entertained, and opened the door to let her out.
I t was not a trifling business to get the great umbrella up, and properly
balanced in her grasp ; but at last I successfully accomplished this, and saw
it go bobbing down the street through the rain, without the least appear-
ance of having anybody underneath it, except when a heavier fall than
usual from some overcharged water-spout sent it toppling over, on one
side, and discovered Miss Mowcher struggling violently to get it right.
After making one or two sallies to her relief, which were rendered futile
by the umbrella's hopping on again, like an immense bird, before I could
reach it, I came in, went to bed, and slept till morning.
    I n the morning I was joined by Mr. Peggotty and by my old nurse, and
we went at an early hour to the coach office, where Mrs. Gummidge and
Ham were waiting to take leave of us.
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            329
    " Mas'r Davy," Ham whispered, drawing me aside, while Mr. Peggotty

 was stowing his bag among the luggage, "his life is quite broke up. He
 doen't know wheer he 's going ; he doen't know what 's afore him ; he 's
bound upon a voyage that '11 last, on and oE, all the rest of his days,
take my wured for't, unless he finds what he's a seeking of. I am sure
you '11 be a friend to him, Mas'r Davy ?"
    "Trust me, I will indeed," said I, shaking hands with Ham earnestly.
    "Thankee. Thankee, very kind, sir. One thing furder. I'm in
good employ, you know, Mas'r Davy, and I han't no way now of spending
what I gets. Money's of no use to me no more, except to live. If you
can lay it out for him, I shall do my work with a better art. Though as
to that, sir," and he spoke very steadily and mildly, "you're not to
think but I shall work at all times, like a man, and act the best that lays
in my power ! "
    I told him I was well convinced of it; and I hinted that I hoped
the time might even come, when he would cease to lead the lonely life he
naturally contemplated now.
    " No sir," he said, shaking his head, "all that's past and over with

me, sir. No one can never fill the place that's empty. But you'll bear
in mind about the money, as theer's at all times some laying by for
him ? "
   Reminding him of the fact, that Mr. Peggotty derived a steady, though
certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his late brother-in-
law, I promised to do so. We then took leave of each other. I cannot
leave him, even now, without remembering with a pang, at once his modest
fortitude and his great sorrow.
   As to Mrs. Gummidge, if I were to endeavour to describe how she ran
down the street by the side of the coach, seeing nothing but Mr. Peggotty
on the roof, through the tears she tried to repress, and dashing herself
against the people who were coming in the opposite direction, I should
enter on a task of some difficulty. Therefore 1 had better leave her
sitting on a baker's door-step, out of breath, with no shape at all remaining
in her bonnet, and one of her shoes off, lying on the pavement at a
considerable distance.
    When we got to our journey's end, our first pursuit was to look about
 for a little lodging for Peggotty, where her brother could have a bed.
 We were so fortunate as to find one, of a very clean and cheap description,
 over a chandler's shop, only two streets removed from me. When we had
 engaged this domicile, I bought some cold meat at an eating-house, and
 took my fellow-travellers home to tea; a proceeding, I regret to state,
 which did not meet with Mrs. Crupp's approval, but quite the contrary.
 I ought to observe, however, in explanation of that lady's state of mind,
 that she was much offended by Peggotty's tucking up her widow's gown
 before she had been ten minutes in the place, and setting to work to dust
 my bed-room. This Mrs. Crupp regarded in the light of a liberty, and
 a liberty, she said, was a thing she never allowed.
    Mr. Peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to London,
 for which I was not unprepared. I t was, that he purposed first seeing
 Mrs. Steerforth. As I felt bound to assist him in this, and also to
 mediate between them ; with the view of sparing the mother's feelings as
330           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

much as possible, I wrote to her that night. I told her as mildly as I
could what his wrong was, and what my own share in his injury. I said
he was a man in very common life, but of a most gentle and upright
character; and that I ventured to express a hope that she would not
refuse to see him in his heavy trouble. I mentioned two o'clock in the
afternoon as the hour of our coming, and I sent the letter myself by the
first coach in the morning.
   At the appointed time, we stood at the door-the door of that house
where I had been, a few days since, so happy : where my youthful
confidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely:
which was closed against me henceforth : which was now a waste,
a ruin.
   No Littimer appeared. The pleasanter face which had replaced his, on
the occasion of my last visit, answered to our summons, and went before
us to the drawing-room. Mrs. Steerforth was sitting there. Rosa Dartle
glided, as we went in, from another part of the room, and stood behind
her chair.
   I saw, directly, in his mother's face, that she knew from himself what
he had done. It was very pale; and bore the traces of deeper emotion
than my letter alone, weakened by the doubts her fondness would have
raised upon it, would have been likely to create. I thought her more
like him than ever I had thought her; and I felt, rather than saw, that
the resemblance was not lost on my companion.
    She sat upright in her arm-chair, with a stately, immoveable, passionless
air, that it seemed as if nothing could disturb. She looked very stedFdstly
at Mr. Peggotty when he stood before her ; and he looked, quite as
stedfastly, at her. Rosa Dartle's keen glance comprehended all of us.
For some moments not a word was spoken.
    She motioned to Mr. Peggotty to be seated. He said, in a low voice,
" I shouldn't feel it nat'ral, ma'am, to sit down in this house. I ' d sooner
stand."      And this was succeeded by another silence, which she broke
thus :
    " I know, with deep regret, what has brought you here.          What do
you want of me? What do you ask me to d o ? "
    He put his hat under his arm, and feeling in his breast for Emily's
letter, took it out, unfolded it, and gave it to her.
    " Please to read that, ma'am. That's my niece's hand ! "
    She read it, in the same stately and impassive way,-untouched by its
contents, as far as I could see,-and returned it to him.
    " ' Unless he brings me back a lady,' " said Mr. Peggotty, tracing out
that part with his finger. " I come to know, ma'am, whether he will
keep his mured? "
   '$ No," she returned.
    " Why not ? " said Mr. Peggotty.
    " I t is impossible. He would disgrace himself. You cannot fail to
 know that she is far below him."
    " Raise her up ! " said Mr. Peggotty.

    " She is uneducated and ignorant."
    "Maybe she 's not; maybe she is," said Mr. Peggotty. "I think
 not, ma'am ; but I 'm no judge of them things. Teach her better ! "
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           331
   " Since you oblige me to speak more plainly, which I am very unwilling

to do, her humble connexions would render such a thlng impossible, if
nothing else did."
   " Hark to this, ma'am," he returned, slowly and quietly.     " You know
what it is to love your ch~ld. So do I. If she was a hundred times my
ch~ld,I couldn't love her more. You doen't know what it is to lose your
child. I do. All the heaps of riches in the wureld would be nowt to me
(if they was mine) to buy her back ! But, save her from this disgrace,
and she shall never be disgraced by us. Not one of us that she's growed
up among, not one of us that's lived along with her, and had her for
their all in all, these many year, will ever look upon her pritty face again.
We '11 be content to let her be ; we'll be content to think of her, far off,
as if she was underneath another sun and sky; we '11 be content to trust
her to her husband,-to       her little children p'raps,-and  bide the time
when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our God ! "
   The rugged eloquence with which he spoke, was not devoid of all
effect. She still preserved her proud manner, but there was a touch of
 softness in her voice, as she answered:
    " I justify nothing.   I make no counter-accusations. But I am sorry to
 repeat, it is impossible. Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my
 son's career, and ruin his prospects. Noth~ngis more certain than
that it never can take place, and never will. If there is any other
compensation-"
   " I am looking at the likeness of the face," interrupted Mr. Peggotty,
with a steady but a kindling eye, "that has looked at me, in my home, at
my fireside, in my boat-wheer not ?-smiling and friendly, when it was
so treacherous, that I go half wild when I think of it. If the likeness of
that face don't turn to burning fire, at the thought of offering money to
me for my child's blight and ruin, it's as bad. I doen't know, being a
lady's, but what it's worse."
   She changed now, in a moment. An angry flush overspread her
features ; and she said, in an intolerant manner, grasping the arm-chair
tightly with her hands :
   "What compensation can you make to me for opening such a pit
between me and my son? What is your love to mine? What is your
separation to ours ? '"
   Miss Dartle softly touched her, and bent down her head to whisper, but
she would not hear a word.
   " No, Rosa, not a word !     Let the man listen to what I say ! My son,
who has been the object of my life, to whom its every thought has been
devoted, whom I have gratified from a chlld in every wish, from whom I
have had no separate existence since his birth,-to take up in a moment
with a miserable girl, and avoid me ! To repay my confidence with sys-
tematic deception, for her sake, and quit me for her ! To set this wretched
fancy, against his mother's claims upon his duty, love, respect, gratitude-
claims that every day and hour of his life should have strengthened into
ties that nothing could be proof against ! Is this no injury? "
   Again Rosa Dartle tried to soothe her ; again ineffectually.
   " I say, Rosa, not a word ! If he can stake his all upon the lightest
object, I can stake my all upon a greater purpose. Let him go where he
332           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

will, with the means that my love has secured to him ! Does he think to
reduce me by long absence ? H e knows his mother very little if he does.
Let him put away his whim now, and he is welcome back. Let him not
put her away now, and he never shall come near me, living or dying,
while I can raise my hand to make a sign against it, unless, being rid of
her for ever, he comes humbly to me and begs for my forgiveness. This
is my right. This is the acknowledgment I will have. This is the sepa-
ration that there is between us ! And is this," she added, looking at her
visitor with the proud intolerant air with which she had begun, " no
injury ? "
   While I heard and saw the mother as she said these words, I seemed to
hear and see the son, defying them. All that I had ever seen in him of
an unyielding, wilful spirit, I saw in her. 811 the understanding that I
had now of his misdirected energy, became an understanding of her
character too, and a perception that it was, in its strongest springs, the
same.
    She now observed to me, aloud, resuming her former restraint, that it
was useless to hear more, or to say more, and that she begged to put an
end to the interview. She rose with an air of dignity to leave the room,
when Mr. Peggotty signified that it was needless.
    "Doen't fear me being any hindrance to you, I have no more to say,
ma'am," he remarked, as he moved towards the door. " I come heer with
no hope, and I take away no hope. I have done what I thowt should be
done, but I never looked fur any good to come of my stau'ning where I do.
 This has been too evil a house fur me and mine, fur me to be in my right
 senses and expect it."
    With this, we departed; leaving her standing by her elbow chair, a
 picture of a noble presence and a handsome face.
    We had, on our way out, to cross a paved hall, with glass sides and roof,
 over which a vine was trained. Its leaves and shoots were green then, and
 the day being sunny, a pair of glass doors leading to the garden were
 thrown open. Rosa Dartle, entering this way with a noiseless step, when
 we were close to them, addressed herself to me :
    cc You do well," she said, " indeed, to bring this fellow here ! "
    Such a concentration of rage and scorn as darkened her face, and flashed
in her jet-black eyes, I could not have thought compressible eveninto that
face. The scar made by the hammer was, as usual in this excited state of
her features, strongly marked. When the throbbing I had seen before,
 came into it as I looked at her, she absolutely lifted up her hand, and
 struck it.
    " This is a fellow," she said, " to champion and bring here, is he not ?

You are a true man ! "
    " Miss Dartle," I returned, "you are surely not so unjust as to
 condemn me !"
    " Why do you bring division between these two mad creatures? " she
returned. "Don't you know that they are both mad with their own self-
 will and pride ? "
    " I s it my doing? " I returned.
    " I s it your doing ! " she retorted. " Why do you bring this man
 here ? "
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           333
   c c He is a deeply-injured man, Miss Dartle," I replied.  " You may not

 know it."
   'I I know that James Steerforth," she said, with her hand on her bosom,

as if to prevent the storm that was raging there, from being loud, "has a
false, corrupt heart, and is a traitor. But what need I know or care about
this fellow, and his common niece ? "
       Miss Dartle," I returned, "you deepen the injury. I t is sufficient
already. I will only say, at parting, that you do him a great wrong."
   " I do him no wrong," she returned. " They are a depraved worth-
less set. I would have her whipped! "
   Mr. Peggotty passed on, without a word, and went out at the door.
    " Oh, shame, Miss Dartle ! shame ! " I said indignantly.     " How can
you bear to trample on his undeserved affliction ! "
    " I would trample on them all," she answered. " I would have his
house pulled down. I would have her branded on the face, drest in rags,
and cast out in the streets to starve. If I had the power to sit in judg-
ment on her, I would see it done. See it done ? I would do it ! I
detest her. If I ever could reproach her with her infamous condition,
I would go anywhere to do so. If I could hunt her to her grave, I
would. If there was any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in
her dying hour, and only I possessed it, I wouldn't part with it for
Life itself."
   The mere vehemence of her words can convey, I am sensible, but a weak
impression of the passion by which she was possessed, and which made
itself articulate in her whole figure, though her voice, instead of being
raised, was lower than usual. No description I could give of her would
do justice to my recollection of her, or to her entire deliverance of herself
to her anger. I have seen passion in many forms, but I have never seen
it in such a form as that.
   When I joined Mr. Peggotty, he was walking slowly and thoughtfully
down the hill. H e told me, as soon as I came up with him, that having
now discharged his mind of what he had purposed doing in London, he
meant "to set out on his travels," that night. I asked him where he
meant to go ? He only answered, I 'm a going, sir, to seek my niece."
                                    ('

   We went back to the little lodging over the chandler's shop, and there
I found an opportunity of repeating to Peggotty what he had said to me.
She informed me, in return, that he had said the same to her that morn-
ing. She knew no more than I did, where he was going, but she thought
he had some project shaped out in his mind.
    I did not like to leave him, under such circumstances, and we all three
dined together off a beefsteak pie-which was one of the many good
things for which Peggotty was famous-and which was curiously flavoured
on this occasion, I recollect well, by a miscellaneous taste of tea, coffee,
butter, bacon, cheese, new loaves, firewood, candles, and walnut ketchup,
continually ascending from the shop. After dinner we sat for an hour or
so near the window, without talking much; and then Mr. Peggotty got
up, and brought his oilskin bag and his stout stick, and laid them on
the table.
    He accepted, from his sister's stock of ready money, a small sum on
account of his legacy; barely enough, I should have thought, to keep
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 him for a month. He promised to communicate with me, when anything
 befel him; and he slung his bag about him, took his hat and stick, and
 bade us both " Good bye ! "
    " All good attend you, dear old woman," he said, embracing Peggotty,

 "and you too, Mas'r Davy ! " shaking hands with me. " I 'm a going to
 seek her, fur and wide. If she should come home while I ' m away,-but
 ah, that ain't like to be !-or if I should bring her back, my meaning is,
 that she and me shall live and die where no one can't reproach her. If
any hurt should come to me, remember that the last words I left for her
was, 'My unchanged love is with my darling child, and I forgive her !' "
   He said this solemnly, bare-headed ; then, putting on his hat, he went
down the stairs, and away. We followed to the door. I t was a warm,
dusty evening, just the time when, in the great main thoroughfare out of
which that bye-way turned, there was a temporary lull in the eternal tread
of feet upon the pavement, and a strong red sunshine. He turned, alone, at
the corner of our shady street, into a glow of light, in which we lost him.
   Rarely did that hour of the evening come, rarely did I wake at night,
rarely did I look up at the moon, or stars, or watch the falling rain, or
hear the wind, but I thought of his solitary figure toiling on, poor pilgrim,
and recalled the words :
   " I ' m a going to seek her, fur and wide. If any hurt should come
to me, remember that the last words I left for her was, 'My unchanged
love is with my darling child, and I forgive her !' "




                          CHAPTER XXXIII.
                                 BLISSFUL.

   ALL this time, I had gone on loving Dora, harder than ever. Her idea
was my refuge in disappointment and distress, and made some amends to
me, even for the loss of my friend. The more I pitied myself, or pitied
others, the more I sought for consolation in the image of Dora.
The greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world, the
brighter and the purer shone the star of Dora high above the world.
I don't think I had any definite idea where Dora came from, or in what
degree she was related to a higher order of beings ; but I am quite sure I
should have scouted the notion of her being simply human, like any other
young lady, with indignation and contempt.
   If I may so express it, I was steeped in Dora. I was not merely over
head and ears in love with her, but I was saturated through and through.
Enough love might have been wrung out of me, metaphorically speaking,
to drown anybody in ; and yet there would have remained enough within
me, and all over me, to pervade my entire existence.
   The first thing I did, on my own account, when I came back, was to
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           335
 take a night-walk to Norwood, and, like the subject of a venerable riddle
 of my childhood to go "round and round the house, without ever touching
 the house," thinking about Dora. I believe the theme of this incompre-
 hensible conundrum was the moon. No matter what i t was, I, the
 moon-struck slave of Dora, perambulated round and round the house and
 garden for two hours, looking through crevices in the palings, getting my
 chin by dint of violent exertion above the rusty nails on the top, blowing
 kisses at the lights in the windows, and romantically calling on the night,
 at intervals, to shield my Dora-I don't exactly know what from, I sup-
 pose from fire. Perhaps from mice, to which she had a great objection.
     My love was so much on my mind, and it was so natural to me to
 confide in Peggotty, when I found her again by my side of an evening
 with the old set of industrial implements, busily making the tour of my
 wardrobe, that I imparted to her, in a sufficiently roundabout way, my
 great secret. Peggotty was strongly interested, but I could not get her
 into my view of the case at all. She was audaciously prejudiced in my
 favour, and quite unable to understand why I should have any misgivings,
 or be low-spirited about it. ' The young lady might think herself well
 off,' she observed, ' t o have such a beau. And as to her Pa,' she said,
  'what did the gentleman expect, for gracious sake ! '
     I observed, however, that Mr. Spenlow's Proctorial gown and stiff cravat
 took Peggotty down a little, and inspired her with a greater reverence for the
 man who was gradually becoming more and more etherealized in my eyes
 every day, and about whom a reflected radiance seemed to me to beam when
 he sat erect in Court among his papers, like a little light-house in a sea of
 stationery. And by-the-by, it used to be uncommonly strange to me to con-
 sider, I remember, as I sat in Court too, how those dim old judges and doc-
tors wouldn't have cared for Dora, if they had known her; how they wouldn't
have gone out of their senses with rapture, if marriage with Dora had
been proposed to them; how Dora might have sung, and played upon
that glorified guitar, until she led me to the verge of madness, yet not
have tempted one of those slow-goers an inch out of his road !
    I despised them, to a man. Frozen-out old gardeners in the flower-
beds of the heart, I took a personal offence against them all. The Bench
was nothing to me but an insensible blunderer. The Bar had no more
tenderness or poetry in it, than the Bar of a public-house.
    Taking the management of Peggotty's affairs into my own hands, with
no little pride, I proved the will, and came to a settlement with the Legacy
Duty-office, and took her to the Bank, and soon got everything into an
orderly train. We varied the legal character of these proceedings by going
to see some perspiring Wax-work, in Fleet Street (melted, I should hope,
these twenty years) ; and by visiting Miss Linwood's Exhibition, which I
remember as a Mausoleum of needlework, favorable to self-examination
and repentance; and by inspecting the Tower of London; and going t o
the top of St. Paul's. All these wonders afforded Peggotty as much
pleasure as she was able to enjoy, under existing circumstances : except, I
think, St. Paul's, which, from her long attachment to her workbox, became
a rival of the plcture on the lid, and was, in some particulars, vanquished,
she considered, by that work of art.
    Peggotty's business, which was what we used to call " common form
336            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 business" in the Commons (and very light and lucrative the common-
 form business was), being settled, I took her down to the office one
 morning to pay her bill. Mr. Spenlow had stepped out, old Tiffey said,
 to get a gentleman sworn for a marriage license ; but as I knew he would
 be back directly, our place lying close to the Surrogate's, and to the Vicar-
 General's office too, I told Peggotty to wait.
    We were a little like undertakers, in the Commons, as regarded Probate
transactions ;generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up, when
we had to deal with clients in mourning. I n a similar feeling of delicacy,
we were always blithe and light-hearted with the license clients. There-
fore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find Mr. Spenlow much recovered
from the shock of Mr. Barkis's decease; and indeed he came in like a
bridegroom.
    But neither Peggotty nor I had eyes for him, when we saw, in company
with him, Mr. Murdstone. He was very little changed. His hair looked
as thick, and was certainly as black, as ever; and his glance was as little
to be trusted as of old.
    " Ah, Copperfield ? " said Mr. Spenlow. " You know this gentleman,
I believe ? "
    I made my gentleman a distant bow, and Peggotty barely recognised
him. He was, at first, somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together;
but quickly decided what to do, and came up to me.
    " I hope," he said, "that you are doing well? "

    " I t can hardly be interesting to you," said I. "Yes, if you wish to
know."
    We looked at each other, and he addressed himself to Peggotty.
    "And you," said he. " I am sorry to observe that you have lost your
husband."
    " It's not the first loss I have had in my life, Mr. Murdstone," replied
Peggotty, trembling from head to foot. " I am glad to hope that there
 is nobody to blame for this one,-nobody to answer for it."
    "Ha ! " said he; "that's a comfortable reflection. You have done
your duty ? "
    " I have not worn any body's life away," said Peggotty, " I am
thankful to think! No, Mr. Murdstone, I have not worrited and
frightened any sweet creetur to an early grave ! "
    H e eyed her gloomily-remorsefully I thought-for an instant; and
said, turning his head towards me, but looking at my feet instead of my
face :
    "We are not likely to encounter soon again ;-a source of satisfaction
to us both, no doubt, for such meetings as this can never be agreeable.
I do not expect that you, who always rebelled against my just authority,
exerted for your benefit and reformation, should owe me any good will
now. There is an antipathy between us-"
    " An old one, I believe? " said I, interrupting him.

    He smiled, and shot as evil a glance at me as could come from his dark
eyes.
    " I t rankled in your baby breast," he said.   " It embittered the life of
your poor mother. You are right. I hope you may do better, yet; I hope
you may correct yourself."

     Here he ended the dialogue, which had been carried on in a low voice,
  in a corner of the outer office, by passing into Mr. Spenlow's room, and
  saying aloud, in his smoothest manner :
     '< Gentlemen of Mr. Spenlow's profession are accustomed to family
  differences, and know how complicated and difficult they always are! "
  With that, he paid the money for his license ; and, receiving it neatly folded
  from Mr. Spenlow, together with a shake of the hand, and a polite wish
  for his happiness and the lady's, went out of the office.
     I might have had more difficulty in constraining myself to be silent
  under his words, if I had had less difficulty in impressing upon Peggotty
  (who was only angry on my account, good creature !) that we were not in
  a place for recrimination, and that I besought her to hold her peace. She
 was so unusual1y roused, that I was glad to compound for an affectionate
  hug, elicited by this revival in her mind of our old injuries, and to make
 the best I could of it, before Mr. Spenlow and the clerks.
     Mr. Spenlow djd not appear to know what the connexion between
 Mr. Murdstone and myself was ; which I was glad of, for I could not bear
 to acknowledge him, even in my own breast, remembering what I did of
 the history of my poor mother. Mr. Spenlow seemed to think, if he thought
  anything about the matter, that my aunt was the leader of the state
 party in our family, and that there was a rebel party commanded by
 somebody else-so I gathered at least from what he said, while we were
 waiting for Mr. Tiffey to make out Peggotty's bill of costs.
     "Miss Trotwood," he remarked, " is very firm, no doubt, and not
 likely to give way to opposition. I have an admiration for her character,
 and I may congratulate you, Copperfield, on being on the right side.
 Differences between relations are much to be deplored-but             they are
 extremely general-and the great thing is, to be on the right side:"
meaning, I take it, on the side of the moneyed interest.
    " Rather a good marriage this, I believe ? " said Mr. Spenlow.
    I explained that I knew nothing about it.
    " Indeed ! " he said.    " Speaking from the few words Mr. Murdstone

dropped-as a man frequently does on these occasions-and from what
Miss Murdstone let fall, I should say it was rather a good marriage."
    " Do you mean that there is money, sir? " I asked.
    " Yes,"   said Mr. Spenlow, " I understand there 's money. Beauty
too, I am told."
    " Indeed?     I s his new wife young? "
    " Just of age," said Mr. Spenlow.       " So lately, that I should think
they had been waiting for that."
    " Lord deliver her 1 " said Peggotty.    So very emphatically and unex-
pectedly, that we were all three discomposed; until Tiffey came in with
the bill.
    Old Tiffey soon appeared, however, and handed it to Mr. Spenlow, to
look over. Mr. Spenlow, settling his chin in his cravat and rubbing it
softly, went over the items with a deprecatory air-as if it were all Jorkins's
doing-and handed it back to Tiffey with a bland sigh.
    " Yes," he said.      " That's right. Quite right. I should have been
extremely happy, Copperfield, to have limited these charges to the actual
expenditure out of pocket; but it is an irksome incident in my professional
                                                                   z
338             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

life, that I am not at liberty to consult my own wishes. I have a partner
-Mr. Jorkins."
    As he said this with a gentle melancholy, which was the next thing to
making no charge at all, I expressed my acknowledgments on Peggotty's
behalf, and paid Tiffey in bank notes. Peggotty then retired to her lodging,
and Mr. Spenlow and I went into Court, where we had a divorce-suit
coming on, under an ingenious little statute (repealed now, I believe, but
in virtue of which I have seen several marriages annulled), of which the
merits were these. The husband, whose name was Thomas Benjamin,
had taken out his marriage license as Thomas only; suppressing the
Benjamin, in case he should not find himself as comfortable as he expected.
Not finding himself as comfortable as he expected, or being a little
fatigued with his wife, poor fellow, he now came forward by a friend,
after being married a year or two, and declared that his name was Thomas
Benjamin, and therefore he was not married at all. Which the Court con-
firmed, to his great satisfaction.
   I must say that I had my doubts about the strict justice of this, and
was not even frightened out of them by the bushel of wheat which recon-
ciles all anomalies. But Mr. Spenlow argued the matter with me. H e
said, Look at the world, there was good and evil in that; look at the
ecclesiastical law, there was good and evil in Rat. It was all part of a
system. Very good. There you were !
    I had not the hardihood to suggest to Dora's father that possibly
we might even improve the world a little, if we got up early in the morn-
ing, and took off our coats to the work; but I confessed that I thought
we might improve the Commons. Mr. Spenlow replied that he would
 particularly advise me to dismiss that idea from my mind, as not being
 worthy of my gentlemanly character; but that he would be glad to hear
 from me of what improvement I thought the Commons susceptible ?
    Taking that part of the Commons which happened to be nearest to
 us-for our man was unmarried by this time, and we were out of Court,
 and strolling past the Prerogative Office-I submitted that I thought
 the Prerogative Office rather a queerly managed institution. Mr.
 Spenlow inquired in what respect? I replied, with all due deference to
 his experience (but with more deference, I am afraid, to his being Dora's
father), that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the Registry of that
 Court, containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects within
 the immense province of Canterbury, for three whole centuries, should be an
 accidental building, never designed for the purpose, leased by the registrars
 for their own private emolument, unsafe, not even ascertained to be fire-
 proof, choked with the important documents it held, and positively, from
 the roof to the basement, a mercenary speculation of the registrars, who
 took great fees from the public, and crammed the public's wills away
 anyhow and anywhere, having no other object than to get rid of them
 cheaply. That, perhaps, it was a little unreasonable that these registrars
 in the receipt of profits amounting to eight or nine thousand pounds a
 year (to say nothing of the profits of the deputy registrars, and clerks of
 seats), should not be obliged to spend a little of that money, in finding a
 reasonably safe place for the important documents which all classes of
 people were compelled to hand over to them, whether they would or no.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            339
 That, perhaps, it was a little unjust that all the great offices in this great
 office, should be magnificent sinecures, while the unfortunate working-
 clerks in the cold dark room up-stairs were the worst rewarded, and the
 least considered men, doing important services, in London. That perhaps
 it was a little indecent that the principal registrar of all, whose duty it
 was to find the public, constantly resorting to this place, all needful
 accommodation, should be an enormous sinecurist in virtue of that post
 (and might be, besides, a clergyman, a pluralist, the holder of a stall in
 a cathedral, and what not),-while the public was put to the incon-
 venience of which we had a specimen every afternoon when the office
 was busy, and which we knew to be quite monstrous. That, perhaps, in
 short, this Prerogative Office of the diocese of Canterbury was altogether
 such a pestilent job, and such a pernicious absurdity, that but for its
being squeezed away, in a corner of Saint Paul's Churchyard, which few
people knew, it must have been turned completely inside out, and upside
down, long ago.
    Mr. Spenlow smiled as I became modestly warm on the subject, and
 then argued this question with me as he had argued the other. He said,
 what was it after all? I t was a question of feeling. If the public felt
 that their wills were in safe keeping, and took it for granted that the office
 was not to be made better, who was the worse for i t ? Nobody? Who was
 the better for i t ? All the Sinecurists. Very well. Then the good pre-
 dominated. I t might not be a perfect system; nothing was perfect; but
what he objected to, was, the insertion of the wedge. Under the Prero-
 gative Office, the country had been glorious. Insert the wedge into the
Prerogative Office, and the country would cease to be glorious. H e
considered it the principle of a gentleman to take things as he found them;
and he had no doubt the Prerogative Office would last our time. I de-
ferred to his opinion, though I had great doubts of it myself. I find he
was right, however; for it has not only lasted to the present moment,
but has done so in the teeth of a great parliamentary report made (not
too willingly) eighteen years ago, when all these objections of mine were
set forth in detail, and when the existing stowage for wills was described
as equal to the accumulation of only two years and a half more. What
they have done with them since ; whether they have lost many, or whether
they sell any, now and then, to the butter shops; I don't know. I am
glad mine is not there, and I hope it may not go there, yet awhlle.
    I have set all this down, in my present blissful chapter, because here it
comes into its natural place. Mr. Spenlow and I falling into this con-
versation, prolonged it and our saunter to and fro, until we diverged
into general topics. And so it came about, in the end, that Mr. Spenlow
told me this day week was Dora's birthday, and he would be glad if I
would come down and join a little pic-nic on the occasion. I went out
of my senses immediately; became a mere driveller next day, on receipt
of a little lace-edged sheet of note paper, " Favoured by papa. To
remind ;" and passed the intervening period in a state of dotage.
    I think I committed every possible absurdity, in the way of preparation
for this blessed event. I turn hot when I remember the cravat I bought.
My boots might be placed in any collection of instruments of torture. I
provided, and sent down by the Norwood coach the night before, a
                                                                z2
340            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 delicate little hamper, amounting in itself, I thought, almost to a
 declaration. There were crackers in it with the tenderest mottos that
 could be got for money. At six in the morning, I was in Covent Garden
 Market, buying a bouquet for Dora. At ten I was on horseback (I hired
a gallant grey, for the occasion), with the bouquet in my hat, to keep it
fresh, trotting down to Norwood.
   I suppose that when I saw Dora in the garden and pretended not to
see her, and rode past the house pretending to be anxiously looking for it,
I committed two small fooleries which other young gentlemen in my
circumstances might have committed-because they came so very natural
to me. But oh! when I did find the house, and did dismount at the
garden gate, and drag those stoney-hearted boots across the lawn to Dora
sitting on a garden seat under a lilac tree, what a spectacle she was,
upon that beautiful morning, among the butterflies, in a white chip
bonnet and a dress of celestial blue !
   There was a young lady with her-comparatively stricken in years-
almost twenty, I should say. Her name was Miss Mills, and Dora
called her Julia. She was the bosom friend of Dora. Happy Miss
Mills !
   Jip was there, and Jip would bark at me again. When I presented my
bouquet, he gnashed his teeth with jealousy. Well he might. If he had
the least idea how I adored his mistress, well he might!
   " Oh, thank you, Mr. Copperfield! What dear flowers !" said Dora.
   I had had an intention of saying (and had been studying the best form
of words for three miles) that I thought them beautiful before I saw them
so near her. But I couldn't manage it. She was too bewildering. To
see her lay the flowers against her little dimpled chin, was to lose all pre-
sence of mind and power of language in a feeble ecstacy. I wonder I
didn't say, " Kill me, if you have a heart, Miss Mills. Let me die
here ! "
   Then Dora held my flowers to Jip to smell. Then Jip growled, and
wouldn't smell them. Then Dora laughed, and held them a little closer to
Jip, to make him. Then Jip laid hold of a bit of geranium with his teeth,
and worried imaginary cats in it. Then Dora beat him, and pouted, and
said, " My poor beautiful flowers ! " as compassionately, I thought, as if
Jip had laid hold of me. I wished he had !
   "You'll be so glad to hear, Mr. Copperfield," said Dora, "that that
cross Miss Murdstone is not here. She has gone to her brother's mar-
riage, and will be away at least three weeks. Isn't that delightful? "
   I said I was sure it must be delightful to her, and all that was delight-
ful to her was delightful to me. Miss Mills, with an air of superior wisdom
and benevolence, smiled upon us.
   '( She is the most disagreeable thing I ever saw," said Dora. "You
can't believe how ill-tempered and shocking she is, Julia."
    "Yes, I can, my dear ! " said Julia.
    " You can, perhaps, love,"   returned Dora, with her hand on Julia's.
 "Forgive my not excepting you, my dear, at first."
    I learnt, from this, that Miss Mills had had her trials in the course of a
chequered existence; and that to these, perhaps, I might refer that wise
benignity of manner which I had already noticed. I found, in the course
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           341
of the day, that this was the case : Miss Mills having been unhappy in
a misplaced affection, and being understood to have retired from the world
on her awful stock of experience, but still to take a calm interest in the
unblighted hopes and loves of youth.
    But now Mr. Spenlow came out of the house, and Dora went to him,
saying, " Look, papa, what beautiful flowers ! " And Miss Mills smiled
thoughtfully, as who should say, "Ye May-flies, enjoy your brief existence
in the bright morning of life ! " And we all walked from the lawn towards
the carriage, which was getting ready.
    I shall never have such a ride again. I have never had such another.
There were only those three, their hamper, my hamper, and the guitar-
case, in the phaeton; and, of course, the phaeton was open; and I rode
behind it, and Dora sat with her back to the horses, looking towards me.
 She kept the bouquet close to her on the cushion, and wouldn't allow Jip
to sit on that side of her at all, for fear he should crush it. She often
 carried it in her hand, often refreshed herself with its fragrance. Our eyes
at those times often met; and my great astonishment is that I didn't go
over the head of my gallant grey into the carriage.
    There was dust, I believe. There was a good deal of dust, I believe.
 I have a faint impression that Mr. Spenlow remonstrated with me for
 riding in it; but I knew of none. I was sensible of a mist of love and
beauty about Dora, but of nothing else. He stood up sometimes, and
asked me what I thought of the prospect. I said it was delightful, and I
daresay it was ; but it was all Dora to me. The sun shone Dora, and the
birds sang Dora. The south wind blew Dora, and the wild flowers in the
hedges were all Doras, to a bud. My comfort is, Miss Mills understood
me. Miss Mills alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly.
    I don't know how long we were going, and to this hour I know as
little where we went. Perhaps it was near Guildford. Perhaps some
Arabian-night magician, opened up the place for the day, and shut it for
ever when we came away. I t was a green spot, on a hill, carpeted with
soft turf. There were shady trees, and heather, and, as far as the eye
could see, a rich landscape.
    I t was a trying thing to find people here, waiting for us; and my
jealousy, even of the ladies, knew no bounds. But all of my own sex-
especially one impostor, three or four years my elder, with a red whisker,
on which he established an amount of presumption not be endured-were
my mortal foes.
    We all unpacked our baskets, and employed ourselves in getting dinner
ready. Red Whisker pretended he could make a salad (which I don't
believe), and obtruded himself on public notice. Some of the young ladies
washed the lettuces for him, and sliced them under his directions. Dora
was among these. I felt that fate had pitted me against this man, and
one of us must fall.
    Red Whisker made his salad (I wondered how they could eat it.
Nothing should have induced me to touch it !) and voted himself into the
 charge of the wine-cellar, which he constructed, being an ingenious beast,
in the hollow trunk of a tree. By:and-by I saw him, with the majority of
 a lobster on his plate, eating his dinner at the feet of Dora !
    I have but an indistinct idea of what happened for some time after this
  342           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    baleful object presented itself to my view. I was very merry, I know ; but
   it was hollow merriment. I attached myself to a young creature in pink,
   with little eyes, and flirted with her desperately. She received my atten-
   tions with favour; but whether on my account solely, or because she had
   any designs on Red Whisker, I can't say. Dora's health was drunk.
   When I drank it, I affected to interrupt my conversation for that purpose,
   and to resume it immediately afterwards. I caught Dora's eye as I bowed
  to her, and I thought it looked appealing. But it looked at me over the
  head of Red Whisker, and I was adamant.
     The young creature in pink had a mother in green; and I rather think
  the latter separated us from motives of policy. Howbeit, there was a
  general breaking up of the party, while the remnants of the dinner were
  being put away; and I strolled off by myself among the trees, in a raging
  and remorseful state. I was debating whether I should pretend that I
  was not well, and fly-I don't know where-upon my gallant grey, when
 Dora and Miss Mills met me.
     c r Mr. Copperfield," said Miss Mills, " you are dull."
     I begged her pardon. Not at all.
     " And, Dora," said Miss Mills, "yow -    are dull."
     Oh dear no ! Not in the least.
     " Mr. Copperfield and Dora," said Miss Mills, with an almost venerable
 air. "Enough of this. Do not allow a trivial misunderstanding to
 wither the blossoms of spring, which, once put forth and blighted, can not
 be renewed. I speak," said Miss Mills, ", from experience of the past-
 the remote irrevocable past. The gushing fountains which sparkle in the
  sun, must not be stopped in mere caprice; the oasis in the desert of
  Sahara, must not be plucked up idly."
     I hardly knew what I did, I was burning all over to that extraordinary
 extent ; but I took Dora's little hand and kissed it-and she let me ! I
 kissed Miss Mills's hand; and we all seemed, to my thinking, to go
 straight up to the seventh heaven.
     We did not come down again. We stayed up there all the evening. At
 first we strayed to and fro among the trees : I with Dora's shy arm drawn
through mine : and Heaven knows, folly as it all was, it would have been
a happy fate to have been struck immortal with those foolish feelings, and
have strayed among the trees for ever !
    But, much too soon, we heard the others laughing and talking, and
calling "where's Dora!" So we went back, and they wanted Dora to
sing. Red Whisker would have got the guitar-case out of the carriage,
but Dora told him nobody knew where it was, but I. So Red Whisker
was done for in a moment ; and I got it, and I unlocked it, and I took the
guitar out, and I sat by her, and I held her handkerchief and gloves, and
I drank in every note of her dear voice, and she sang to me who loved her,
and all the others might applaud as much as they liked, but they had
nothing to do with it !
    I was intoxicated with joy. I was afraid it was too happy to be
real, and that I should wake in Buckingham Street presently, and hear
Mrs. Crupp clinking the teacups in getting breakfast ready. But Dora
sang, and others sang, and Miss Mills sang-about the slumbering echoes
in the caverns of Memory ; as if she were a hundred years old-and the
                        OX DAVID COPPE RFIELD.                          343
evening came on; and we had tea, with a kettle boiling gipsy-fashion ; and
I was still as happy as ever.
   I was happier than ever when the party broke up, and the other people,
defeated Red Whisker and all, went their several ways, and we went ours
through the still evening and the dying light, with sweet scents rising
up around us. Mr. Spenlow being a little drowsy after the champagne-
honour to the soil that grew the grape, to the grape that made the wine,
to the sun that ripened it, and to the merchant who adulterated it !-and
being fast asleep in a corner of the carriage, I rode by the side, and talked
to Dora. She admired my horse and patted him-oh, what a dear little
hand it looked upon a horse !-and her shawl would not keep right, and
now and then I drew it round her with my arm ; and I even fancied that
Jip began to see how it was, and to understand that he must make up his
mind to be friends with me.
   That sagacious Miss Mills, too ; that amiable, though quite used up,
recluse ; that little patriarch of something less than twenty, who had done
with the world, and mustn't on any account have the slumbering echoes
in the caverns of Memory awakened ; what a kind thing she did !
    " Mr. Copperfield," said Miss Mills, "come to this side of the carriage
a moment-if you can spare a moment. I want to speak to you."
   Behold me, on my gallant grey, bending at the side of Miss Mills, with
my hand upon the carriage-door !
    " Dora is coming to stay with me.      She is coming home with me the
day after to-morrow. If you would like to call, I am sure papa would be
happy to see you."
   What could I do but invoke a silent blessing on Miss Mills's head, and
store Miss Mills's address in the securest corner of my memory ! What
could I do but tell Miss Mills, with grateful looks and fervent words, how
much I appreciated her good offices, and what an inestimable value I set
upon her friendship !
   Then Miss Mills benignantly dismissed me, saying, "Go back to Dora! "
and I went; and Dora leaned out of the carriage to talk to me, and
we talked all the rest of the way ; and I rode my gallant grey so close to
the wheel that I grazed his near fore leg against it, and "took the bark
off," as his owner told me, to the tune of three pun' sivin "-which I
paid, and thought extremely cheap for so much joy. What time Miss
Mills sat looking at the moon, murmuring verses and recalling, I suppose,
the ancient days when she and earth had anything in common.
   Norwood was many miles too near, and we reached it many hours too
soon; but Mr. Spenlow came to himself a little short of it, and said,
"You must come in, Copperfield, and rest ! " and I consenting, we had
sandwiches and wine-and-water. I n the light room, Dora blushing looked
so lovely, that I could not tear myself away, but sat there staring, in a
dream, until the snoring of Mr. Spenlow inspired me with sufficient con-
sciousness to take my leave. So we parted; I riding all the way to
London with the farewell touch of Dora's hand still light on mine, recalling
every incident and word ten thousand times; lying down in my own bed
at last, as enraptured a young noodle as ever was carried out of his five
wits by love.
   When I awoke next morning, I was resolute to declare my passion
 344            THE PERSONAL HlSTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  to Dora, and know my fate. Happiness or misery was now the ques-
  tion. There was no other question that I knew of in the world, and
  only Dora could give the answer to it. I passed three days in a luxury
  of wretchedness, torturing myself by putting every conceivable variety of
  discouraging construction on all that ever had taken place between Dora
  and me. At last, arrayed for the purpose at a vast expense, I went to
  Miss Mills's, fraught with a declaration.
     How many times I went up and down the street, and round the square
 -painfully aware of being a much better answer to the old riddle than the
 original one-before I could persuade myself to go up the steps and
 knock, is no matter now. Even when, at last, I had knocked, and was
 waiting at the door, I had some flurried thought of asking if that were
 Mr. Blackboy's (in imitation of poor Barkis), begging pardon, and retreating.
 But I kept my ground.
     Mr. Mills was not at home. I did not expect he would be. Nobody
 wanted him. Miss Mills was at home. Miss Mills would do.
     I was shown into a room upstairs, where Miss Mills and Dora were.
 Jip was there. Miss Mills was copying music ( I recollect, it was a
 new song, called Affection's Dirge), and Dora was paintingflowers. What
 were my feelings, when I recognised my own flowers ; the identical Covent
 Garden Market purchase ! I cannot say that they were very like, or that
 they particularly resembled any flowers that have ever come under my
 observation ; but I knew from the paper round them, which was accurately
 copied, what the composition was.
     Miss Mills was very glad to see me, and very sorry her Papa was not at
 home : though I thought we all bore that with fortitude. Miss Mills was
 conversational for a few minutes, and then, laying down her pen upon
 Affection's Dirge, got up, and left the room.
     I began to think I would put it off till to-morrow.
     "I hope your poor horse was not tired, when he got home at night,"
 said Dora, lifting up her beautiful eyes. " I t was a long way for him."
     I began to think I would do it to-day.
     " I t was a long way for him," said I, " for he had nothing to uphold him

on the journey."
    " Wasn't he fed, poor thing? " asked Dora.
    I began to think I would put it off till to-morrow.
    " Ye-yes," I said, " he was well taken care of. I mean he had not the
unutterable happiness that I had in being so near you."
    Dora bent her head over her drawing, and said, after a little while-
I had sat, in the interval, in a burning fever, and with my legs in a very
rigid state-
    " You didn't seem to be sensible of that happiness yourself, at one time
of the day."
    I saw now that I was in for it, and it must be done on the spot.
    "You didn't care for that happiness in the least," said Dora, slightly
raising her eyebrows, and shaking her head, "when you were sitting by
Miss Kitt."
    Kitt, I should observe, was the name of the creature in pink, with the
little eyes.
    "Though certainly I don't know why you should," said Dora, " or why
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          345
you should call it a happiness at all. But of course you don't mean what
you say. And I am sure no one doubts your being at liberty to do what-
 ever you like. Jip, you naughty boy, come here ! ''
    I don't know how I did it. I did it in a moment. I intercepted Jip. I had
Dora in my arms. I was full of eloquence. I never stopped for a word.
I told her how I loved her. I told her I should die without her. I told
her that I idolised and worshipped her. Jip barked madly all the time.
    When Dora hung her head and cried, and trembled, my eloquence
increased so much the more. If she would like me to die for her, she
had but to say the word, and I was ready. Life without Dora's love was
not a thing to have on any terms. I couldn't bear it, and I wouldn't. I
had loved her every minute, day and night, since I first saw her. I loved
her at that minute to distraction. I should always love her, every minute,
to distraction. Lovers had loved before, and lovers would love again;
but no lover had ever loved, might, could, would, or should ever love, as
I loved Dora. The more I raved, the more Jip barked. Each of us, in
his own way, got more mad every moment.
    Well, well ! Dora and I were sitting on the sofa by-and-by, quiet
enough, and Jip was lying in her lap, winking peacefully at me. I t was
 off my mind. I was in a state of perfect rapture. Dora and I were
engaged.
    I suppose we had some notion that this was to end in marriage. We
must have had some, because Dora stipulated that we were never to be
married without her papa's consent. But, in our youthful ecstacy, I
don't think that we really looked before us or behind us; or had any
aspiration beyond the ignorant present. We were to keep our secret from
Mr. Spenlow; but I am sure the idea never entered my head, then, that there
was anything dishonorable in that.
    Miss Mills was more than usually pensive when Dora, going to find her,
brought her back ;-I apprehend, because there was a tendency in what had
passed to awaken the slumbering echoes in the caverns of memory. But
she gave us her blessing, and the assurance of her lasting friendship, and
spoke to us, generally, as became a Voice from the Cloister.
    What an idle time it was ! What an unsubstantial, happy, foolish time
it was !
    When I measured Dora's finger for a ring that was to he made of
Forget-me-nots, and when the jeweller, to whom I took the measure, found
me out, and laughed over his order book, and charged me anything he
liked, for the pretty little toy, with its blue stones-so associated in my
remembrance with Dora's hand, that yesterday, when I saw such another,
by chance, on the finger of my own daughter, there was a momentary
stirring in my heart, like pain !
    When I walked about, exalted with my secret, and full of my own
interest, and felt the dignity of loving Dora, and of being beloved, so much,
that if I had walked the air, I could not have been more above the people
not so situated, who were creeping on the earth !
    When we had those meetings in the garden of the square, and sat within
the dingy summer-house, so happy, that I love the London sparrows to this
hour, for nothing else, and see the plumage of the tropics in their smoky
feathers !
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    When we had our first great quarrel (within a week of our betrothal),
 and when Dora sent me back the ring, enclosed in a despairing cocked-
 hat note, wherein she used the terrible expression that " our love had
 begun in folly, and ended in madness ! " which dreadful words occasioned
 me to tear my hair, and cry that all was over !
    When, under cover of the night, I flew to Miss Mills, whom I saw by
 stealth in a back kitchen where there was a mangle, and implored Miss
Mills to interpose between us and avert insanity. When Miss Mills under-
took the office and returned with Dora, exhorting us, from the pulpit of
her own bitter youth, to mutual concession, and the avoidance of the Desert
of Sahara !
    When we cried, and made it up, and were so blest again, that the back-
kitchen, mangle and all, changed to Love's own temple, where we arranged
a plan of correspondence through Miss Mills, always to comprehend at
least one letter on each side every day !
    What an idle time ! What an unsubstantial, happy, foolish time ! Of all
the times of mine that Time has in his grip, there is none that in one
retrospection I can smile at half so much, and think of half so tenderly.




                         CHAPTER XXXIV.
                        MY AUNT ASTONISHES ME.

    I WROTE to Agnes as soon as Dora and I were engaged. I wrote her
 a long letter, in which I tried to make her comprehend how blest I was,
 and what a darling Dora was. I entreated Agnes not to regard this as
 a thoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other, or had the
 least resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used to joke about. I
 assured her that its profundity was quite unfathomable, and expressed my
 belief that nothing like it had ever been known.
    Somehow, as I wrote to Agnes on a fine evening by my open window,
 and the remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came stealing
 over me, it shed such a peaceful influence upon the hurry and agitation
 in which I had been living lately, and of which my very happiness partook
in some degree, that it soothed me into tears. I remember that I sat
 resting my head upon my hand, when the letter was half done, cherishing
 a general fancy as if Agnes were one of the elements of my natural home.
 As if, in the retirement of the house made almost sacred to me by her
presence, Dora and I must be happier than anywhere. As if, in love,
joy, sorrow, hope, or disappointment; in all emotions; my heart turned
 naturally there, and found its refuge and best friend.
    Of Steerforth, I said nothing. I only told her there had been sad grief
 at Yarmouth, on account of Emily's flight; and that on me it made a
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           347
  double wound, by reason of the circumstances attending it. I knew how
  quick she always was to divine the truth, and that she would never be
  the first to breathe his name.
     To this letter, I received an answer by return of post. As I read it, I
  seemed to hear Agnes speaking to me. I t was like her cordial voice in
  my ears. What can I say more !
     While I had been away from home lately, Traddles had called twice or
  thrice. Finding Peggotty within, and being informed by Peggotty (who
  always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive it),
  that she was my old nurse, he had established a good-humoured acquaint-
  ance with her, and had stayed to have a little chat with her about me. So
  Peggotty said; but I am afraid the chat was all on her own side, and of
  immoderate length, as she was very difficult indeed to stop, God bless her!
  when she had me for her theme.
     This reminds me, not only that I expected Traddles on a certain after-
 noon of his own appointing, which was now come, but that Mrs. Crupp
 had resigned everything appertaining to her office (the salary excepted) until
 Peggotty should cease to present herself. Mrs. Crupp, after holding
 divers conversations respecting Peggotty, in a very high pitched voice, on
 the staircase-with some invisible Familiar it would appear, for corporeally
 speaking she was quite alone at those times-addressed a letter to me,
 developing her views. Beginning it with that statement of universal applica-
 tion, which fitted every occurrence of her life, namely, that she was a mother
 herself, she went on to inform me that she had once seen very different
 days, but that at all periods of her existence she had had a constitutional
 objection to spies, intruders, and informers. She named no names, she
 said ; let them the cap fitted, wear it ; but spies, intruders, and informers,
 especially in widders' weeds (this clause was underlined), she had ever
 accustomed herself to look down upon. If a gentleman was the victim
of spies, intruders, and informers (but still naming no names), that was his
own pleasure. He had a right to please himself; so let him do. All
that she, Mrs. Crupp, stipulated for, was, that she should not be " brought
in contract" with such persons. Therefore she begged to be excused
from any further attendance on the top set, until things was as they
formerly was, and as they could be wished to be; and further mentioned
that her little book would be found upon the breakfast-table every Satur-
day morning, when she requested an immediate settlement of the same,
with the benevolent view of saving trouble, " and an ill-conwenience " tc
all parties.
    After this, Mrs. Crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on the stairs,
principally with pitchers, and endeavouring to delude Peggotty into break-
ing her legs. I found it rather harassing to live in this state of siege,
but was too much afraid of Mrs. Crupp to see any way out of it.
    "My dear Copperfield," cried Traddles, punctually appearing at my
door, in spite of all these obstacles, "how do you do?"
    " My dear Traddles," said I, " I am delighted to see you at last, and
very sorry I have not been at home before. But I have been so much
engaged -"
    " Yes, yes, I know," said Traddles, " of course. Your's lives in London,
I think."
 348              T H E PERSONAL HISTORY AND E X P E R I E N C E

       '' What did you say? "
       " She-excuse me-Miss       D., you know," said Traddles, colouring in
 his great delicacy, " lives in London, I believe ? "
      I' Oh yes.  Near London."       .
      "Mine, perhaps you recollect," said Traddles, with a serious look,
  I' lives down in Devonshire-one      of ten. Consequently, I am not so much
 engaged as you-in that sense."
      " I wonder you can bear," I returned, "to see her so seldom."

      " Hah ! " said Traddles, thoughtfully. " I t does seem a wonder. I
 suppose it is, Copperfield, because there 's no help for it ? "
      "I suppose so," I replied, with a smile, and not without a blush.
 " And because you have so much constancy and patience, Traddles."
     " Dear me ! " said Traddles, considering about it, " do I strike you in
that way, Copperfield? Really I didn't know that I had. But she is such
an extraordinarily dear girl herself, that it 's possible she may have imparted
something of those virtues to me. Now you mention it, Copperfield, I
shouldn't wonder at all. I assure you she is always forgetting herself, and
taking care of the other nine."
     " I s she the eldest ? " I inquired.

     " Oh dear, no," said Traddles.      " The eldest is a Beauty."

     He saw, I suppose, that I could not help smiling at the simplicity of
this reply ; and added, with a smile upon his own ingenuous face :
      "Not, of course, but that my Sophy-pretty name, Copperfield, I
 always think ? "
      " Very pretty ! " said I.
      "Not, of course, but that Sophy is beautiful too, in my eyes, and would
 be one of the dearest girls that ever was, in anybody's eyes (I should
 think). But when I say the eldest is a Beauty, I mean she really is a-"
 he seemed to be describing clouds about himself, with both hands:
 " Splendid, you know," said Traddles, energetically.
      "Indeed ! " said I.
      " Oh, I assure you," said Traddles, " something very uncommon,
indeed ! Then, you know, being formed for society and admiration, and
not being able to enjoy much of it, in consequence of their limited means,
she naturally gets a l$le irritable and exacting, sometimes. Sophy puts
her in good humour !
     " I s Sophy the youngest ? " I hazarded.
     " Oh dear, no ! " said Traddles, stroking his chin. " The two youngest
are only nine and ten. Sophy educates 'em."
     " The second daughter, perhaps ? " I hazarded.
     " No," said Traddles.     " Sarah 's the second.   Sarah has something the
matter with her spine, poor girl. The malady will wear out by-and-by,
the doctors say, but in the meantime she has to lie down for a twelvemonth.
Sophy nurses her. Sophy 's the fourth."
     " Is the mother living? " I inquired.

     " Oh yes," said Traddles, " she is alive. She is a very superior woman,

indeed, but the damp country is not adapted to her constitution, and-in
fact, she has lost the use of her limbs."
  '$    Dear me !" said I.
     "Very sad, is it not? " returned Traddles. "But in a merely domestic
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           349
view it is not so bad as it might be, because Sophy takes her place. She
is quite as much a mother to her mother, as she is to the other nine."
    I felt the greatest admiration for the virtues of this young lady; and,
honestly with the view of doing my best to prevent the good-nature of
Traddles from being imposed upon, to the detriment of their joint pros-
pects in life, inquired how Mr. Micawber was ?
    " He is quite well, Copperfield, thank you," said Traddles. " I am not
living with him at present."
     <<No?"
     " No.   You see the truth is," said Traddles, in a whisper, " he has
 changed his name to Mortimer, in consequence of his temporary embarrass-
 ments ; and he don't come out till after dark-and then in spectacles.
 There was an execution put into our house, for rent. Mrs. Micawber was
in such a dreadful state that I really couldn't resist giving my name to that
 second bill we spoke of here. You may imagine how delightful it was to
 my feelings, Copperfield, to see the matter settled with it, and Mrs. Micaw-
 ber recover her spirits."
    " Hum ! " said I.
    " Not that her happiness was of long duration," pursued Traddles,
 " for, unfortunately, within a week another execution came in. I t broke
 up the establishment. I have been living in a furnished apartment since
then, and the Mortimers have been very private indeed. I hope you won't
think it selfish, Copperfield, if I mention that the broker carried off my
little round table with the marble top, and Sophy's flower-pot and stand? "
    " What a hard thing ! " I exclaimed indignantly.

    " I t was a-it      was a pull," said Traddles, with his usual wince at
that expression. " I don't mention it reproachfully, however, but with a
motive. The fact is, Copperfield, I was unable to repurchase them at the
time of their seizure ; in the first place, because the broker, having an idea
that I wanted them, ran the price up to an extravagant extent ; and, in the
second place, because I-hadn't       any money. Now, I have kept my eye
since, upon the broker's shop," said Traddles, with a great enjoyment of
his mystery, " which is up at the top of Tottenham Court Road, and, at
last, to-day I find them put out for sale. I have only noticed them from
over the way, because if the broker saw me, bless you, he 'd ask any price
for them! What has occurred to me, having now the money, is, that
perhaps you wouldn't object to ask that good nurse of yours to come with
me to the shop-I can show it her from round the corner of the next
street-and make the best bargain for them, as if they were for herself,
that she can ! "
    The delight with which Traddles propounded this plan to me, and the
sense he had of its uncommon artfulness, are among the freshest things in
my remembrance.
   I told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him, and that
we would all three take the field together, but on one condition. That
condition was, that he should make a solemn resolution to grant no more
loans of his name, or anything else, to Mr. Micawber.
    '' My dear Copperfield," said Traddles, " I have already done so,
because I begin to feel that I have not only been inconsiderate, but that I
have been positively unjust to Sophy. My word being passed to myself,
 350           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 there is no longer any apprehension; but I pledge it to you, too, with the
 greatest readiness. That first unlucky obligation, I have paid. I have
 no doubt Mr. Micawber would have paid it if he could, but he could not.
 One thing I ought to mention, which I like very much in Mr. Micawber,
 Copperfield. I t refers to the second obligation, which is not yet due.
 He don't tell me that it is provided for, but he says it will be. Now, I
 think there is something very fair and honest about that ! "
    I was unwilling to damp my good friend's confidence, and therefore
 assented. After a little further conversation, we went round to the
chandler's shop, to enlist Peggotty ; Traddles declining to pass the evening
with me, both because he endured the liveliest apprehensions that his
property would be bought by somebody else before he could re-purchase
it, and because it was the evening he always devoted to writing to the
dearest girl in the world.
   I never shall forget him peeping round the corner of the street in
Tottenham Court Road, while Peggotty was bargaining for the precious
articles; or his agitation when she came slowly towards us after vainly
offering a price, and was hailed by the relenting broker, aud went back
again. The end of the negotiation was, that she bought the property on
tolerably easy terms, and Traddles was transported with pleasure.
    "1 am very much obliged to you, indeed," said Traddles, on hearing it
was to be sent to where he lived, that night. " If I might ask one other
favor, I hope you wouldn't think it absurd, Copperfield ? "
    I said beforehand, certainly not.
    " Then if you would be good enough," said Traddles to Peggotty, " to
get the flower-pot now, I think I should like (it being Sophy's, Copperfield)
to carry it home myself! "
    Peggotty was glad to get it for him, and he overwhelmed her with
thanks, and went his way up Tottenham Court Road, carrying the flower-
pot affectionately in his arms, with one of the most delighted expressions
of countenance I ever saw.
   We then turned back towards my chambers. As the shops had charms
for Peggotty which I never knew them possess in the same degree for
anybody else, I sauntered easily along, amused by her staring in at the
windows, and waiting for her as often as she chose. We were thus a good
while in getting to the Adelphi.
   On our way upstairs, I called her attention to the sudden disappearance
of Mrs. Crupp's pitfalls, and also to the prints of recent footsteps. We
were both very much surprised, coming higher up, to find my outer door
standing open (which I had shut), and to hear voices inside.
   We looked at one another, without knowing what to make of this, and
went into the sitting-room. What was my amazement to find, of all
people upon earth, my aunt there, and Mr. Dick ! My aunt sitting on a
quantity of luggage, with her two birds before her, and her cat on her
knee, like a female Robinson Crusoe, drinking tea. Mr. Dick leaning
thoughtfully on a great kite, such as we had often been out together to
fly, with more luggage piled about him !
    " My dear aunt ! " cried I. "Why, what an unexpected pleasure ! "
   We cordially embraced ; and Mr. Dick and I cordially shook hands ;
and Mrs. Crupp, who was busy making tea, and could not be too attentive,
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            351
cordially said she had knowed well as Mr. Copperfull would have his
heart in his mouth, when he see his dear relations.
       Halloa! " said my aunt to Peggotty, who quailed before her awful
presence. " How are yozc ? "
    " You remember my aunt, Peggotty ? " said I.
    "For the love of goodness, child," exclaimed my aunt, "don't call the
woman by that South Sea Island name ! If she married and got rid of it,
which was the best thing she could do, why don't you give her the benefit
of the change ? What's your name now,-P ? " said my aunt, as a
compromise for the obnoxious appellation,
    '< Barkis, ma'am," said Peggotty, with a curtsey.
    'rWell ! that's human," said my aunt. " I t sounds less as if you
wanted a Missionary. How d' ye do, Barkis ? I hope you're well?"
    Encouraged by these gracious words, and by my aunt's extending her
hand, Barkis came forward, and took the hand, and curtseyed her acknow-
ledgments.
     " We are older than we were, I see," said my aunt. " We have only
met each other once before, you know. A nice business we made of it
then ! Trot. mv dear. another CUD."
     I handed i t iutifuily to my aunt, who was in her usual inflexible state
of figure; and ventured a remonstrance with her on the subject of her
 sitting on a box.
       Let me draw the sofa here, or the easy chair, aunt," said I. " Why
should you be so uncomfortable ? "
     " Thank you, Trot," replied my aunt, " I prefer to sit upon my pro-
perty." Here my aunt looked hard at Mrs. Crupp, and observed, " We
needn't trouble you to wait, ma'am."
     " Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go, ma'am? " said
Mrs. Crupp.
     " No, I thank you, ma'am," replied my aunt.
     " Would you let me fetch another pat of butter, ma'am? "said

Mrs. Crupp. " Or would you be persuaded to try a new-laid hegg? or
should I brile a rasher ? Ain't there nothing I could do for your dear
aunt, Mr. Copperfull ? "
     " Nothing, ma'am,"     returned my aunt. "I shall do very well, I
thank you."
     Mrs. Crupp, who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet temper,
and incessantly holding her head on one side, to express a general feeble-
ness of constitution, and incessantly rubbing her hands, to express a desire
to be of service to all deserving objects, gradually smiled herself, one-sided
herself, and rubbed herself, out of the room.
     " Dick ! " said my aunt.     " You know what I told you about tirne-
servers and wealth-worshippers ? "
    Mr. Dick-with rather a scared look, as if he had forgotten it-returned
a hasty answer in the affirmative.
     " Mrs. Crupp is one of them," said my aunt. " Barkis, I'll trouble
you to look after the tea, and let me have another cup, for I don't fancy
 that woman's pouring-out ! "
     I knew my aunt sufficiently well to know that she had something of
importance on her mind, and that there was far more matter in this
 352           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  arrival than a stranger might have supposed. I noticed how her eye lighted
  on me, when she thought my attention otherwise occupied; and what a
  curious process of hesitation appeared to be going on within her, while
  she preserved her outward stiffness and composure. I began to reflect
  whether I had done anything to offend her; and my conscience whispered
 me that I had not yet told her about Dora. Could it by any means be
 that, I wondered !
    As I knew she would only speak in her own good time, I sat down near
 her, and spoke to the birds, and played with the cat, and was as easy as I
 could be. But I was very far from being really easy; and I should still
 have been so, even if Mr. Dick, leaning over the great kite behind my
 aunt, had not taken every secret opportunity of shaking his head darkly at
 me, and pointing at her.
    " Trot," said my aunt at last, when she had finished her tea, and care-

fully smoothed down her dress, and wiped her lips-" you needn't go,
Barkis !-Trot, have you got to be firm, and self-reliant? "
    " I hope so, aunt."

    " What do you think? " inquired Miss Betsey.
    " I think so, aunt."

    " Then why, my love," said my aunt, looking earnestly at me, "why do
you think I prefer to sit upon this property of mine to-night ? "
    I shook my head, unable to guess.
    " Because," said my aunt, " it 's all I have. Because I ' m ruined, my
dear ! "
    If the house, and every one of us, had tumbled out into the river
together, I could hardly have received a greater shock.
    "Dick knows it," said my aunt, laying her hand calmly on my shoulder.
 "I am ruined, my dear Trot I All I have in the world is in this room,
except the cottage ;and that I have left Janet to let. Barkis, I want to get
a bed for this gentleman to-night. To save expense, perhaps you can make
up something here for myself. Anything will do. It's only for to-night.
We 1' 1 talk about this, more, to-morrow."
   I was roused from my amazement, and concern for her-I am sure, for
her-by      her falling on my neck, for a moment, and crying that she
only grieved for me. I n another moment, she suppressed this emotion ;
and said with an aspect more triumphant than dejected :
   " We must meet reverses boldly, and not suffer them to frighten us, my
dear. We must learn to act the play out. We must live misfortune
down, Trot ! "

   HYDROPATHIC E S T A B L I S H M E N T ,
                   SUDBROOK PARK, NEAR RICHMOND, SURREY.

 THISInstitution, which has been in full and successful operation for eight years, is conducted by JAMES
ELLIS,
    M.D., who resides in the house, and has thus the opportunity of exercising a constant superintend-
ence of the treatment.
    During a lengthened residence a t Grafenburg, Dr. ELLIShad peculiar opportunities of studying the
principles and practice of the Water Cure, under Vincent Priessnitz, who has recommended patients return-
ing to England to place themselves under his care ; added to which, he has made a personal inspection of
the first establishments on the Continent and in England.
    His own experience during a practice of eight years, part of which h e was a coadjutor of Dr. Weiss,
enables him confidently to assert, that all diseases curable, and many incurable by any previously known
means, can be safely and successfully treated by a proper application of the Water Cure alone.
    Sudbrook Park adjoins Richmond Park on its southern and sheltered side, and contains upwards of a
hundred acres. It is richly wooded, and the pleasure grounds are extensive and beautiful, containing
many appliances for the recreation and exercise of the patients. I t is also within five minutes' walk of
the most beautiful part of the river Thames, which is accessible for the amusements of boating and fishing.
     B y special permission of the Queen, there is also a private access to the Royal Park of Richmond.
    T h e air is celebrated for its purity, and the soil being composed of gravel, is peculiarly dry and healthy,
allowing the exercise of walking at all seasons.
     T h e Mansion is admirably adapted for the purpose, the rooms being lofty and spacious. I t was formerly
t h e residence of the Dukes of Argyll and Buccleuch.
     T h e domestic arrangements, superintended by Mrs. ELLIS,are on a complete and liberal scale.
     T h e house is abundantly supplied with the purest water, including, among other sources, the celebrated
Silver spring which takes its rise in Richmond Park,* and the Plunge Baths, Douches, &c,, are fitted u p
i n the most complete manner.
     I t is believed that the improvements made during the past winter have rendered this Establishment one
 of the most complete in Europe.
     Strangers desirous of inspecting the Mansion, Baths, Douches, Pleasure Grounds, Park, &c., are
 admitted on Wednesdays, from 10 till 4 o'clock, by cards only, which may be obtained of Mr. TRELAWNEY
 SAUNDERS,      Bookseller, No. 6, Chafing Cross; Wall's Library, Richmond ; or at the Star and Garter,
 Richmond Hill. Visitors will be required to insert their names and addresses in the Visitors' Book. T h e
 Richmond Railway Station is with~ntwo miles of Sudbrook Park ; an Omnibus runs to meet several of
 the trains, Fare 6d. F l y from the station, Is. 6d. T o the Kingston Station is four miles. Omnihusses
 from St. Paul's Church Yard pass Sudbrook Park several times in the day. Fare 1s. 6d., exclusive of
luggage.
  Further particulars may be obtained on application t o Mr. JOSEPH     DYER,Secretary, a t the Establishment.
                           -----
   * I t is related that
                      Cardinal Wolsey, from the well-known excellence of the water of this vicinity, had it
conveyed in pipes across the Thames, to supply his palace a t Hampton Court.

                          CHAPTER XXXV.
                               DEPRESSION.

   As soon as I could recover my presence of mind, which quite
deserted me in the first overpowering shock of my aunt's intelligence, I
proposed to Mr. Dick to come round to the chandler's shop, and take pos-
session of the bed which Mr. Yeggotty had lately vacated. The chandler's
shop being in Hungerford Market, and Hungerford Market being a very
different place in those days, there was a low wooden colonnade before the
door (not very unlike that before the house where the little man and woman
used to live, in the old weather-glass), which pleased Mr. Dick mightily.
The glory of lodging over this structure would have compensated him, I
dare say, for many inconveniences ; but, as there were really few to bear,
beyond the compound of flavors I have already mentioned, and perhaps
the want of a little more elbow-room, he was perfectly charmed with his
accommodation. Mrs. Crupp had indignantly assured him that there
wasn't room to swing a cat there; but, as Mr. Dick justly observed to
me, sitting down on the foot of the bed, nursing his leg, " You know,
Trotwood, I don't want to swing a cat. I never do swing a cat. There-
fore, what does that signify to me!"
   I tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of the
causes of this sudden and great change in my aunt's affairs. As I might
have expected, he had none at all. The only account he could give of it,
was, that my aunt had said to him, the day before yesterday, " Now, Dick,
are you really and truly the philosopher I take you for? " That then he
had said, Yes, he hoped so. That then my aunt had said, " Dick, I am
ruined." That then he had said "Oh, indeed! " That then my aunt
had praised him highly, which he was very glad of. And that then they
had come to me, and had had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road.
   Mr. Dick was so very complacent, sitting on the foot of the bed, nursing
his leg, and telling me this, with his eyes wide open and a surprised smile,
that I am sorry to say I was provoked into explaining to him that ruin
meant distress, want, and starvation; but, I was soon bitterly reproved
for this harshness, by seeing his face turn pale, and tears course down
his lengthened cheeks, while he fixed upon me a look of such unutterable
woe, that it might have softened a far harder heart than mine. I took
infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had taken to depress
him; and I soon understood (as I ought to have known at first) that he
had been so confident, merely because of his faith in the wisest and most
wonderful of women, and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual
resources. The latter, I believe, he considered a match for any kind of
disaster not absolutely mortal.
   " What can we do, Trotwood?"           said Mr. Dick. " There's the
Memorial-"

              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   "To be sure there is," said I. " But all we can do just now, Mr.
Dick, is to keep a cheerful countenance, and not let my aunt see that we
are thinking about it."
   H e assented to this in the most earnest manner; and implored me, if I
should see him wandering an inch out of the right course, to recal him by
some of those superior methods which were always at my command. But
I regret to state that the fright I had given him proved too much for his
best attempts at concealment. All the evening his eyes wandered to my
aunt's face, with an expression of the most dismal apprehension, as if he
saw her growing thin on the spot. H e was conscious of this, and put a
constraint upon his head; but his keeping that immovable, and sitting
rolling his eyes llke a piece of machinery, did not mend the matter at all.
I saw him look at the loaf at supper (which happened to be a small one),
as if nothing else stood between us and famine ; and when my aunt insisted
on his making his customary repast, I detected him in the act of pocketing
fragments of his bread and cheese; I have no doubt for the purpose of
reviving us with those savings, when we should have reached an advanced
stage of attenuation.
   My aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, which
was a lesson to all of us-to me, I am sure. She was extremely gracious
to Peggotty, except when I inadvertently called her by that name; and,
strange as I knew she felt in London, appeared quite at home. She was
to have my bed, and I was to lie in the sitting-room, to keep guard over
her. She made a great point of being so near the river, in case of a
conflagration; and I suppose really did find some satisfaction in that
circumstance.
   " Trot, my dear," said my aunt, when she saw me making preparations

for compounding her usual night-draught, "No ! "
   " Nothing, aunt ? "
   "Not wine, my dear. Ale."
   "But there is wine here, aunt. And you always have it made of
wine."
   " Keep that, in case of sickness," said my aunt. " We mustn't use it
carelessly, Trot. Ale for me. Half a pint."
   I thought Mr. Dick would have fallen, insensible. My aunt being
resolute, I went out and got the ale myself. As it was growing late,
Peggotty and Mr. Dick took that opportunity of repairing to the chand-
ler's shop together. I parted from him, poor fellow, at the corner of the
street, with his great kite at his back, a very monument of human misery.
   My aunt was walking up and down the room when I returned, crimping
the borders of her nightcap with her fingers. I warmed the ale and made
the toast on the usual infallible principles. When it was ready for her, she
was ready for it, with her nightcap on, and the skirt of her gown turned
back on her knees.
   " My dear," said my aunt, after taking a spoonful of it ; "it's a great
deal better than wine. Not half so bilious."
   I suppose I looked doubtful, for she added :
    " Tut, tut, child.  If nothing worse than Ale happens to us, we are
well off."
    " I should think so myself, aunt, I am sure," said I.

    " Well, then, why don't you think so ? " said my aunt.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    "Because you and I are very different people," I returned.
   "  Stuff and nonsense, Trot ! " replied my aunt.
    My aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment, in which there was very little
affectation, if any ; drinking the warm ale with a teaspoon, and soaking her
strips of toast in it.
    " Trot," said she, " I don't care for strange faces in general, but I rather
like that Barkis of yours, do you know ! "
    " I t 's better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so ! " said I.
    " It's a most extraordinary world," observed my aunt, rubbing her nose ;

 " how that woman ever got into it with that name, is unaccountable to
 me. I t would be much more easy to be born a Jackson, or something
 of that sort, one would think."
    " Perhaps she thinks so, too ; it 's not her fault," said I.
    " I suppose not," returned my aunt, rather grudging the admission;
 " but it's very aggravating. However, she 's Barkis sow. That 's some
 comfort. Barkis is uncommonly fond of you, Trot."
    " There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it," said I.
    " Nothing, I believe," returned my aunt.       " Here, the poor fool has
 been begging and praying about handing over some of her money-because
she has got too much of it ! A simpleton ! "
    My aunt's tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into the
warm ale.
    " She's the most ridiculous creature that ever was born," said my
aunt. "I knew, from the first moment when I saw her with that poor
dear blessed baby of a mother of yours, that she was the most ridiculous
of mortals. But there are good points in Barkis ! "
   Affecting to laugh, she got an opportunity of putting her band to her
eyes. Having availed herself of it, she resumed her toast and her discourse
together.
    " Ah!     Mercy upon us!" sighed my aunt. " I know all about it,
Trot! Barkis and myself had quite a gossip while you were out with
Dick. I know all about it. I don't know where these wretched girls
expect to go to, for my part. I wonder they don't knock out their brains
against-against mantelpieces," said my aunt; an idea which was
 probably suggested to her by her contemplation of mine.
    " Poor Emily ! " said I.
    " Oh, don't talk to me about poor," returned my aunt. " She should
have thought of that, before she caused so much misery ! Give me a kiss,
 Trot. I am sorry for your early experience."
    As I bent forward, she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me,
 and said :
    " Oh, Trot, Trot! And so you fancy yourself in love! Do you? "
    " Fancy, aunt!" I exclaimed, as red as I could be.          " I adore her
 with my whole soul ! "
    " Dora, indeed! " returned my aunt.         " And you mean to say the
little thing is very fascinating, I suppose? "
    " My dear aunt," I replied, "no one can form the least idea what
she is ! "
    " Ah ! And not silly ? " said my aunt.
    " Silly, aunt ! "
356            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single
moment, to consider whether she was or not. I resented the idea, of
course ; but I was in a manner struck by it, as a new one altogether.
      Not light-headed ? " said my aunt.
      Light-headed, aunt ! " I could only repeat this daring speculation
with the same kind of feeling with which I had repeated the preceding
question.
   " Well, well ! " said my aunt.       " I only ask. I don't depreciate her.
Poor little couple! And so you think you were formed for one another,
and are to go through a party-supper-table kind of life, like two pretty
pieces of confectionary, do you, Trot? "
   She asked me this so kindly, and with such a gentle air, half playful
and half sorrowful, that I was quite touched.
   " We are young and inexperienced, aunt, I know," I replied; " and I
dare say we say and think a good deal that is rather foolish. But we love
one another truly, I am sure. If I thought Dora could ever love any-
body else, or cease to love me; or that I could ever love anybody else, or
cease to love her; I don't know what I should do-go out of my mind,
I think ! "
   " Ah, Trot ! " said my aunt, shaking her head, and smiling gravely ;
" blind, blind, blind ! "
    " Some one that I know, Trot," my aunt pursued, after a pause, "though

of avery pliant disposition, has an earnestness of aEection in him thatreminds
me of poor Baby. Earnestness is what that Somebody must look for, to
sustain him and improve him,Trot. Deep, downright, faithful earnestness."
    " If you only knew the earnestness of Dora, aunt ! " I cried.

    " Oh, Trot ! " she said again ; " blind, blind ! " and without knowing
why, I felt a vague unhappy loss or want of something overshadow me like
a cloud.
    " However," said my aunt, "I don't want to put two young creatures
out of conceit with themselves, or to make them unhappy ; so, though it is
a girl and boy attachment, and girl and boy attachments very often-mind !
I don't say always !-come to nothing, still we '11 be serious about it, and
hope for a prosperous issue one of these days. There's time enough for
it to come to anything !"
    This was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover ; but
I was glad to have my aunt in my confidence, and I was mindful of her
being fatigued. So I thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection,
and for all her other kindnesses towards me; and after a tender good
night, she took her nightcap into my bedroom.
    How miserable I was, when I lay down ! How I thought and thought
about my being poor, in Mr. Spenlow's eyes; about my not being what I
thought I was, when I proposed to Dora; about the chivalrous necessity
of telling Dora what my worldly condition was, and releasing her from
her engagement if she thought fit ; about how I should contrive to live,
during the long term of my articles, when I was earning nothing ; about
doing something to assist my aunt, and seeing no way of doing anything ;
about coming down to have no money inmy pocket, and to wear a shabby
coat, and to be able to carry Dora no little presents, and to ride no
 gallant greys, and to show myself in no agreeable light! Sordid and
 selfish as I knew it was, and as I tortured myself by knowing that it was,
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                              357
to let my mind run on my own distress so much, I was so devoted to
Dora that I could not help it. I knew that it was base in me not to think
more of my aunt, and less of myself; but, so far, selfishness was in-
separable from Dora, and I could not put Dora on one side for any
mortal creature. How exceedingly miserable I was, that night !
   As to sleep, I had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes, but I seemed
to dream without the previous ceremony of going to sleep. Now I was
ragged, wanting to sell Dora matches, six bundles for a halfpenny; now I
was at the office in a nightgown and boots, remonstrated with by Mr.
Spenlow on appearing before the clients in that airy attire; now I was
hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell fieom old Tiffey's daily biscuit,
regularly eaten when Saint Paul's struck one ; now I was hopelessly
endeavouring to get a license to marry Dora, having nothing but one of
Uriah Heep's gloves to offer in exchange, which the whole Commons re-
jected; and still, more or less conscious of my own room, I was always
tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed-clothes.
    My aunt was restless, too, for I frequently heard her walking to and
fro. Two or three times in the course of the night, attired in a long
flannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high, she appeared, like a
 disturbed ghost, in my room, and came to the side of the sofa on which I
lay. On the first occasion I started up in alarm, to learn that she inferred
from a particular light in the sky, that Westminster Abbey was on fire;
and to be consulted in reference to the probability of its igniting Bucking-
ham Street, in case the wind changed. Lying still, after that, I found that
she sat down near me, whispering to herself " Poor boy ! " And then it
made me twenty times more wretched, to know how unselfishly mindful
she was of me, and how selfishly mindful I was of myself.
   I t was difficult to believe that a night so long to me, could be short to
anybody else. This consideration set me thinking and thinking of an
 magin nary party where people were dancing the hours away, until that
became a dream too, and I heard the music incessantly playing one tune,
and saw Dora incessantly dancing one dance, w~thouttaking the least
notice of me. The man who had been playing the harp all night, was
trying in vain to cover it with an ordinary sized nightcap, when I awoke;
or I should rather say, when I left off trying to go to sleep, and saw the
sun shining in through the window at last.
   There was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the
streets out of the Strand-it may be there still-in which I have had
many a cold plunge. Dressing myself as quietly as I could, and leaving
Peggotty to look after my aunt, I tumbled head foremost into it, and then
went for a walk to Iiampstead. I had a hope that this brisk treatment
might freshen my wits a little; and I think it did them good, for I soon
came to the conclusion that the first step I ought to take was, to try
if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered. I got
some breakfast on the Heath, and walked back to Doctors' Commons,
along the watered roads and through a pleasant smell of summer flowers,
growing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters' heads, intent on
this first effort to meet our altered circumstances.
   I arrived at the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour's loitering
about the Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always first, appeared with
his key. Then I sat down in my shady corner, looking up at the sunlight
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking about Dora; until Mr. Spenlow
  came in, crisp and curly.
       How are yon, Copperfield? " said he. " Fine morning ! "
     "Beautiful morning, sir," said I. " Could I say a word to you before
 you go into Court ? "
     "By all means," said he. "Come into my room."
    I followed him into his room, and he began putting on his gown, and
 touching himself up before alittle glass he had, hanging inside a closet door.
    " I am sorry to say," said I, "that I have some rather disheartening
 intelligence from my aunt."
    "No ! " said he. "Dear me ! Not paralysis, I hope ? "
    " I t has no reference to her health, sir," I replied. " She has met with
 some large losses. I n fact, she has very little left, indeed."
    " You as-tound me, Copperfield ! " cried Mr. Spenlow.
    I shook my head. " Indeed, sir," said I, "her affairs are so changed,
that I wished to ask you whether it would be possible-at a sacrifice
on our part of some portion of the premium, of course," I put in this, on
the spur of the moment, warned by the blank expression of his face-" to
cancel my articles ? "
    What it cost me to make this proposal, nobody knows. It was like
asking, as a favor, to be sentenced to transportation from Dora.
    " To cancel your articles, Copperfield ?    Cancel ? "
    I explained with tolerable firmness, that I really did not know where
my means of subsistence were to come from, unless I could earn them
for myself. I had no fear for the future, I said-and I laid great emphasis
on that, as if to imply that I should still be decidedly eligible for a son-
in-law one of these days-but, for the present, I was thrown upon my
own resources.
    "I am extremely sorry to hear this, Copperfield," said Mr. Spenlow.
"Extremely sorry. I t is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason.
I t is not a professional course of proceeding. I t is not a convenient pre-
cedent at all. Far from it. At the same time "-
    "You are very good, sir," I murmured, anticipating a concession.
    " Not at all. Don't mention it," said Mr. Spenlow. " At the same
time, I was going to say, if it had been my lot to have my hands unfet-
tered-if I had not a partner-Mr. Jorkins "-
    My hopes were dashed in a moment, but I made another effort.
    "Do you think, sir," said I, "if I were to mention it to Mr. Jorkins-"
    Mr. Spenlow shook his head discouragingly. " Heaven forbid, Copper-
field," he replied, "that I should do any man an injustice; still less,
Mr. Jorkins. But I know my partner, Copperfield. Mr. Jorkins is not
a man to respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature. Mr. Jorkins
is very difficult to move from the beaten track. You know what he is ! "
    I am sure I knew nothing about him, except that he had originally been
alone in the business, and now lived by himself in a house near Montagu
 Square, which was fearfully in want of painting ; that he came very late of
a day, and went away very early; that he never appeared to be consulted
about anything; and that he had a dingy little black-hole of hisown up-stairs,
 where no business was ever done, and where there was a yellow old
 cartridge-paper pad upon his desk, unsoiled by ink, and reported to be
 twenty years of age.
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

    " Would you object to my mentioning it to him, sir?" I asked.
    "By no means," said Mr. Spenlow. "But I have some experience
 of Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield. I wish it were otherwise, for I should be
 happy to meet your views in any respect. I cannot have the least objection
to your mentioning it to Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield, if you think it worth
while."
    Availing myself of this permission, which was given with a warm shake
 of the hand, I sat thinking about Dora, and looking at the sunlight stealing
 from the chimney-pots down the wall of the opposite house, until
 Mr. Jorkins came. I then went up to Mr. Jorkins's room, and evidently
 astonished Mr. Jorkins very much by making my appearance there.
     " Come in, Mr. Copperfield," said Mr. Jorkins. " Come in ! "
    I went in, and sat down; and stated my case to Mr. Jorkins pretty
 much as I had stated it to Mr. Spenlow. Mr. Jorkins was not by any
 means theawful creature one might have expected, but a large, mild, smooth-
 faced man of sixty, who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in
 the Commons that he lived principally on that stimulant, having little
 room in his system for any other article of diet.
     " You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow, I suppose ? " said Mr.
 Jorkins ; when he had heard me, very restlessly, to an end.
     I answered Yes, and told him that Mr. Spenlow had introduced
 his name.
    "He said I should object ? " asked Mr. Jorkins.
    I was obliged to admit that Mr. Spenlow had considered it probable.
    " I am sorry to say, Mr. Copperfield, I can't advance your object,"
said Mr. Jorkins, nervously. " The fact is-but I have an appointment
at the Bank, if you '11 have the goodness to excuse me."
    With that he rose in a great hurry, and was going out of the room,
when I made bold to say that I feared, then, there was no way of arrang-
ing the matter?
    "No!" said Mr. Jorkins, stopping at the door to shake his head.
"Oh, no ! I object, yon know," which he said very rapidly, and went out.
"You must be aware, Mr. Copperfield," he added, looking restlessly in at
the door again, "if Mr. Spenlow objects ----"
    "Personally, he does not object, sir," said I.
    " Oh ! Personally ! " repeated Mr. Jorkins, in an impatient manner.
"I assure you thcre's an objection, Mr. Copperfield. Hopeless ! What
you wish to be done, can't be done. 1-1 really have got an appoint-
ment at the Bank." With that he fairly ran an7ay; and to the best of my
knowledge, it was three days before he showed himself in the Commons
again.
    Being very anxious to leave no stone unturned, I waited until Mr.
Spenlow came in, and then described what had passed; giving him to
understand that I was not hopeless of his being able to soften the adaman-
tine Jorkins, if he would undertake that task.
    " Copperfield," returned Mr. Spenlow, with a sagacious smile, "yo?
have not known my partner, Mr. Jorkins, as long as I have. Nothing is
farther from my thoughts than to attribute any degree of artifice to Mr.
Jorkins. But Mr. Jorkins has a way of stating his objections whichoften
deceives people. No, Copperfield ! " shaking his head. " Mr. Jorkins is
not to be moved, believe me ! "
360           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   I was completely bewildered betwren Mr. Spenlow and Mr. Jorkins, as
to which of them really was the objecting partner; but I saw with suffi-
cient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the firm, and that
the recovery of my aunt's thousand pounds was out of the question. I n
a state of despondency, which 1 remember with anything but satisfaction,
for I know it still had too much reference to myself (though always in
connexion with Dora), I left the office, and went homeward.
   I was trying to familiarise my mind with the worst, and to present to
myself the arrangements we should have to make for the future in their
sternest aspect, when a hackney chariot coming after me, and stopping at
my very feet, occasioned me to look up. A fjir hand was stretched forth
to me from the window ; and the face I had never seen without a feeling of
serenity and happiness, from the moment when it first turned hack on the
old oak staircase with the great broad balustrade, and when I associated
its softened beauty with the stained glass window in the church, was
smiling on me.
   " Agnes ! " I joyfully exclaimed.      " Oh, my dear Agnes, of all people
in the world, what a pleasure to see you ! "
   " I s it, indeed ? " she said, in her cordial voice.

   " I want to talk to you so much ! " said I.      " It's such a lightening of

my heart, only to look at you ! If I had had a conjuror's cap, there is no
one I should have wished for but you ! "
   " What ? " returned Agnes.
   "Well ! perhaps Dora, first," I admitted, with a blush.
   " Certainly, Dora first, I hope," said Agnes, laughing.
   "But you next ! " said I. " Where are you going ? "
   She was going to my rooms to see my aunt. The day being very fine,
she was glad to come out of the chariot, which smelt (I had my head in it
all this time) like a stable put under a cucumber-frame. I dismissed the
coachman, and she took my arm, and we walked on together. She was
like Hope embodied, to me. How different I felt in one short minute,
having Agnes at my side !
   My aunt had written her one of the odd, abrupt notes-very              little
longer than a Bank note-to which her epistolary efforts were usually
limited. She had stated therein that she had fallen into adversity, and
was leaving Dover for good, but had quite made up her mind to it, and
was so well that nobody need be uncomfortable about her. Agnes had
come to London to see my aunt, between whom and herself there had
been a mutual liking these many years : indeed, it dated from the time of
my taking up my residence in Mr. Wickfield's house. She was not alone,
she said. Her papa was with her-and Uriah Heep.
   "And now they are partners," said I. " Confound him ! "
   " Yes," said Agnes. " They have some business here ; and I took
advantage of their coming, to come too. You must not think my visit all
friendly and disinterested, Trotwood, for-I am afraid I may be cruelly
prejudiced-I do not like to let papa go away alone, with him."
   " Does he exercise the same influence over Mr. Wickfield still, Agnes ? "

   Agnes shook her head. " There is such a change at home," said she,
 "that you would scarcely know the dear old house. They live with
US now."
    " They ? " said I.
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           361
   "Mr. Heep and his mother. He sleeps in your old room," said Agnes,
looking up into my face.
   " I wish I had the ordering     - of his dreams," said I. " He wouldn't
sleep there long."
    " I keep my own little room," said Agnes, "where I used to learn my
lessons. How the time goes ! You remember ? The little panelled room
that opens from the drawing-room ? "
    "Remember, Agnes? When I saw you, for the first time, coming out
at the door, with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side? "
    " I t is just the same," said Agnes, smiling. " I am glad you think of
it so pleasantly. We were very happy."
    "We were, indeed," said I.
    " I keep that room to myself still; but I cannot always desert Mrs.
 Heep, you know. Ar~d so," said Agnes quietly, " I feel obliged to
bear her company, when I might prefer to be alone. But I have no
 other reason to complain of her. If she tires me, sometimes, by her
praises of her son, it is only natural in a mother. He is a very good son
to her."
    I looked at Agnes when she said these words, without detecting in her
any consciousness of Uriah's design. Her mild but earnest eyes met
mine with their own beautiful frankness, and there was no change in her
gentle fsce.
    "The chief evil of their presence in the house," said Agnes, "is that I
cannot be as near papa as I could wish-Uriah Heep being so much
between us-and cannot watch over him, if that is not too bold a thing
to say, as closely as I would. But, if any fraud or treachery is practising
against him, I hope that simple love and truth will be stronger, in the
end. I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil
or misfortune in the world."
   A certain bright smile which I never saw on any other face, died away,
even while I thought how good it was, and how familiar it had once
been to me; and she asked me, with a quick change of expression (we
were drawing very near my street), if I knew how the reverse in my aunt's
circumstances had been brought about. On my replying no, she had
not told me yet, Agnes became thoughtful, and I fancied I felt her arm
tremble in mine.
    We found my aunt alone, in a state of some excitement. A difference
 of opinion had arisen between herself and Mrs. Crupp, on an abstract
 question (the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex) ;
 and my aunt, utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of Mrs. Crupp,
 had cut the dispute short, by informing that lady that she smelt of my
 brandy, and that she would trouble her to walk out. Both of these
 expressions Mrs. Crupp considered actionable, and had expressed her
 intention of bringing before a " British Judy"-meaning,    it was supposed,
 the bulwark of our national liberties.
    My aunt, however, having had time to cool, while Peggotty was out
 showing Mr. Dick the sold~ersat the Horse Guards-and being, besides,
greatly pleased to see Agnes-rather plumed herself on the affair than
otherwise, and received us with unimpaired good humour. When Agnes
laid her bonnet on the table, and sat down beside her, I could not but
think, looking on her mild eyes and her radiant forehead, how natural it
 362           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  seemed to have her there; how trustfully, although she was so young
  and inexperienced, my aunt confided in her ; how strong she was, indeed, in
  simple love and truth.
     We began to talk about my aunt's losses, and I told them what I had
  tried to do that morning.
     " Which was injudicious, Trot," said my aunt, "but wellmeant.      You
  are a generous boy-I suppose I mustsay,young man,now-and I am proud
  of you, my dear. So far, so good. Now, Trot and Agnes, let us look
  the case of Betsey Trotwood in the face, and see how it stands."
     I observed Agnes turn pale, as she looked very attentively at my
  aunt. My aunt, patting her cat, looked very attentively at Agnes.
     " Betsey Trotwood," said my aunt, " who had always kept her money
 matters to herself : "-I don't mean your sister, Trot, my dear, but myself
 -had a certain property. I t don't matter how much; enough to live
 on. More ; for she had saved a little, and added to it. Betsey funded her
 property for some time, and then, by the advice of her man of business,
 laid it out on landed security. That did very well, and returned very good
 interest, till Betsey was paid off. I am talking of Betsey as if she was a
 man-of-war. Well! Then, Betsey had to look about her, for a new
 investment. She thought she was wiser, now, than her man of business,
 who was not such a good man of business by this time, as he used to be-
 I am alluding to your father, Agnes-and she took it into her head to lay
 it out for herself. So she took her pigs," said my aunt, " to a foreign
 market; and a very bad market it turned out to be. First, she lost in the
 mining way, and then she lost in the diving way-fishing up treasure, or
 some such Tom Tidler nonsense," explained my aunt, rubbing her nose;
 " and then she lost in the mining way again, and, last of all, to set the
 thing entirely to rights, she lost in the banking way. I don't know what
 the Bank shares were worth for a little while," said my aunt; " cent per
 cent was the lowest of it, I believe ; but the Bank was at the other end of
the world, and tumbled into space, for what I know; anyhow, it fell to
pieces, and never will and never can pay sixpence ; and Betsey's sixpences
were all there, and there's an end of them. Least said, soonest mended!"
    My aunt concluded this philosophical summary, by fixing her eyes with
a kind of triumph on Agnes, whose color was gradually returning.
    " Dear Miss Trotwood, is that all the history ?" said Agnes.
    " I hope it's enough, child," said my aunt. " If there had been more
money to lose, it wouldn't have been all, I dare say. Betsey would have
contrived to throw that after the rest, and make another chapter, I have
little doubt. But, there was no more money, and there's no more story."
    Agnes had listened at first with suspended breath. Her color
still came and went, but she breathed more freely. I thought I knew
why. I thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might
be in some way to blame for what had happened. My aunt took her
hand in hers, and laughed.
    " Is that all?" repeated my aunt.        " Why, yes, that's all, except,
' And she lived happy ever afterwards.' Perhaps I may add that of
Eetsey yet, one of these days. Now, Agnes, you have a wise head. So
have you, Trot, in some things, though I can't compliment you always ;"
and here my aunt shook her own at me, with an energy peculiar to
herself. " What's to be done ? Here's the cottage, taking one time with
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         363
 another, will produce, say seventy pounds a-year. I think we may
 safely put it down at that. Well !-That's all we 've got," said my aunt ;
 with whom it was an idiosyncrasy, as it is with some horses, to stop very
 short when she appeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long
while.
    " Then," said my aunt, after a rest, " there's Dick. He's good for a
hundred a-year, but of course that must be expended on himself. I
would sooner send him away, though I know I am the only person who
appreciates him, than have him, and not spend his money on himself.
How can Trot and I do best, upon our means ? What do you say, Agnes ?"
    " I say, aunt," I interposed, " that I must do something !"

   " Go for a soldier, do you mean ?" returned my aunt, alarmed; " or go
to sea? I won't hear of it. You are to be a proctor. We're not going
to have any knockings on the head in this family, if you please, sir."
   I was about to explain that I was not desirous of introducing that mode
of provision into the family, when Agnes inquired if my rooms were held
for any long term ?
   " You come to the point, my dear," said my aunt.       " They are not to
be got rid of, for six months at least, unless they could be underlet, and
that I don't believe. The last man died here. Five people out of six
would die-of course-of that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat.
I have a little ready money; and I agree with you, the best thing we can
do, is, to live the term out here, and get Dick a bed-room hard by."
   I thought it my duty to hint at the discomfort my aunt would
sustain, from living in a continual state of guerilla warfare with Mrs.
Crupp; but she disposed of that objection summarily by declaring, that,
on the first demonstration of hostilities, she was prepared to astonish
Mrs. Crupp for the whole remainder of her natural life.
   " I have been thinking, Trotwood," said Agnes, diffidently, " that if

you had time-"
   " I have a good deal of time, Agnes. I am always disengaged after
four or five o'clock, and I have time early in the morning. I n one way
and another," said I, conscious of reddening a little as I thought of the
hours and hours I had devoted to fagging about town, and to and fro
upon the Norwood Road, " I have abundance of time."
    " I know you would not mind," said Agnes, coming to me, and
speaking in a low voice, so full of sweet and llopeful consideration that I
hear it now, " the duties of a secretary."
    " Mind, my dear Agnes ? "
    " Because," continued Agnes, " Doctor Strong has acted on his
 intention of retiring, and has come to live in London ; and he asked papa,
I know, if he could recommend him one. Don't you think he would
 rather have his favorite old pupil near him, than anybody else? "
    " Dear Agnes ! " said I. " What should I do without you ! You are
 always my good angel. I told you so. I never think of you in any
 other light."
    Agnes answered with her pleasant laugh, that one good angel (meaning
Dora) was enough; and went on to remind me that the Doctor had been
used to occupy himself in his study, early in the morning, and in the
evening-and that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very
well. I was scarcely more delighted with the prospect of earning my
364            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 own bread, than with the hope of earning it under my old master; in
 short, acting on the advice of Agnes, I sat down and wrote a letter to the
 Doctor, stating my object, and appointing to call on him next day at ten
in the forenoon. This I addressed to Highgate-for in that place, so
memorable to me, he lived-and went out and posted, myself, without
losing a minute.
    Wherever Agnes was, some agreeable token of her noiseless presence
 seemed inseparable from the place. When I came back, I found my
aunt's birds hanging, just as they had hung so long in the parlor window
of the cottage; and my easy chair imitating my aunt's much easier chair
in its position at the open window ; and even the round green fan, which
my aunt had brought away with her, screwed on to the window-sill. I
knew who had done all this, by its seeming to have quietly done itself;
and I should have known in a moment who had arranged my neglected
books in the old order of my school days, even if I had supposed Agnes
to be miles away, instead of seeing her busy with them, and smiling at the
disorder into which they had fallen.
   My aunt was quite gracious on the subject of the Thames (it really did
look very well with the sun upon it, though not like the sea before the
cottage), but she could not relent towards the London smoke, which, she
said, " peppered everything." A complete revolution, in which Yeggotty
bore a prominent part, was being effected in every corner of my rooms,
in regard of this pepper; and I was looking on, thinking how little even
Peggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle, and how much Agnes
did without any bustle at all, when a knock came at the door.
   " I think," said Agnes, turning pale, "it's    papa. H e promised me
that he would come."
   I opened the door, and admitted, not only Mr. Wickfield, but Uriah
Heep. I had not seen Mr. Wickfield for some time. I was prepared
for a great change in him, after what I had heard from Agnes, but his
appearance shocked me.
   It was not that he looked many years older, though still dressed with
the old scrupulous cleanliness ; or that there was an unwholesome ruddi-
ness upon his face ; or that his eyes were full and bloodshot ; or that there
was a nervous trembling in his hand, the cause of which I knew, and had
for some years seen at work. I t was not that he had lost his good looks,
or his old bearing of a gentleman-for that he had not-but the thing
that struck me most, was, that with the evidences of his native superiority
still upon him, he should submit himself to that crawling impersonation of
meanness, Uriah Heep. The reversal of the two natures, in their relative
positions, Uriah's of power and Mr. Wickfield's of dependence, was a sight
more painful to me than I can express. If I had seen an Ape taking com-
mand of a Man, I should hardly have thought it a more degrading spectacle.
   He appeared to be only too conscious of it himself. When he came in,
he stood still; and with his head bowed, as if he felt it. This was only
for a moment; for Agnes softly said to him, " Papa! Here is Miss Trot-
wood-and Trotwood, whom you have not seen for a long while! " and
then he approached, and constrainedly gave my aunt his hand, and shook
hands more cordially with me. I n the moment's pause I speak of, I
saw Uriah's countenance form itself into a most ill-favored smlle. Agnes
 saw it too, I think, for she shrank from him.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            365
    What my aunt saw, or did not see, I defy the science of physiognomy
to have made out, without her own consent. I believe there never was
anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose. Her
face might have been a dead wall on the occasion in question, for any
light it threw upon her thoughts ; until she broke silence with her usual
abruptness.
    G c Well, Wickfield!" said my aunt; and he looked up at her for the
first time. " I have been telling your daughter how well I have been
disposing of my money for myself, because I couldn't trust it to you, as
you were growing rusty in business matters. We have been taking
 counsel together, and getting on very well, all things considered. Agnes
 is worth the whole firm, in my opinion."
    " If I may umbly make the remark," said Uriah Heep, with a writhe,
 " I fully agree with Miss Betsey Trotwood, and should be only too
 appy if Miss Agnes was a partner."
     " You're a partner yourself, you know," returned my aunt, "and that 's

 about enough for you, I expect. How do you find yourself, sir?"
    In acknowledgment of this question, addressed to him with extraordi-
 nary curtness, Mr. Heep, uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he car-
 ried, replied that he was pretty well, he thanked my aunt, and hoped she
 was the same.
    " And you, Master-I should say, Mister Copperfield," pursued Uriah.
 "I hope I see you well ! I am rejoiced to see you, Mister Copperfield,
even under present circumstances." I believed that; for he seemed to
relish them very much. " Present circumstances is not what your friends
would wish for you, Mister Copperfield, but it isn't money makes the
man : it 's-I am really unequal with my umble powers to express what
it is," said Uriah, with a fawning jerk, "but it isn't money ! "
    Here he shook hands withme: not in the common way, but standing at
a good distance from me, and lifting my hand up and down like a pump
handle, that he was a little afraid of.
    " And how do you think we are looking, Master Copperfield,-I       should
say, Mister? " fawned Uriah. " Don't you find Mr. Wickfield blooming,
sir? Years don't tell much in our firm, Master Copperfield, except in
raising up the umble, namely, mother and self-and        in developing," he
added as an after-thought, " the beautiful, namely Miss Agnes."
    He jerked himself about, after this compliment, in such an intolerable
manner, that my aunt, who had sat looking straight at him, lost all
patience.
    " Deuce take the man ! " said my aunt, sternly, "what 's he about ?

Don't be galvanic, sir ! "
    " I ask your pardon, Miss Trotwood," returned Uriah ; " I '     rn aware
 you 're nervous."
     " Go along with you, sir ! " said my aunt, anything but appeased.
  " Don't presume to say so ! I am nothing of the sort. If you 're an eel, sir,
 conduct yourself like one. If you're a man, control your limbs, sir!
 Good God ! " said my aunt, with great indignation, " I am not going to
 be serpentined and corkscrewed out of my senses ! "
    Mr. Heep was rather abashed, as most people might have been, by
 this explosion; which derived great additional force from the indignant
 manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair, and shook her
366            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him. But, he said to me
 aside in a meek voice :
    "I am well aware, Master Copperfield, that Miss Trotwood, though an
 excellent lady, has a quick temper (indeed I think I had the pleasure of
 knowing her, when I was a numble clerk, before you did, Master Copper-
 field), and it's only natural, I am sure, that it should be made quicker by
 present circumstances. The wonder is, that it isn't much worse ! I
 only called to say that if there was anything we could do, in present cir-
 cumstances, mother or self, or Wickfield and Heep, we should be really
 glad. I may go so far?" said Uriah, with a sickly smile at his partner.
    " Uriah Heep," said Mr. Wickfield, in a monotonous forced way, " is

 active in the business, Trotwood. What he says, I quite concur in. You
 know I had an old interest in you. Apart from that, what Uriah says
 I quite concur in ! "
    " Oh, what a reward it is," said Uriah, drawing up one leg,at the risk of

bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt, " t o be so
trusted in ! But I hope I am able to do something to relieve him from
the fatigues of business, Master Copperfield ! "
    " Uriah Heep is a great relief to me," said Mr. Wickfield, in the same

 dull voice. " It's a load off my mind, Trotwood, to have such a partner."
    The red fox made him say all this, I knew, to exhibit him to me in the
light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest. I saw the
 same ill-favored smile upon his face again, and saw how he watched me.
    " You are not going, papa? " said Agnes, anxiously.       "Will you not
walk back with Trotwood and me? "
    He would have looked to Uriah, I believe, before replying, if that worthy
had not anticipated him.
    " I am bespoke myself," said Uriah, " on business; otherwise I should

have been appy to have kept with my friends. But I leave my partner to
represent the firm. Miss Agnes, ever yours ! I wish you good-day,
Master Copperfield, and leave my umble respects for Miss Betsey Trotwood."
    With those words, he retired, kissing his great hand, and leering at us
like a mask.
    We sat there, talking about our pleasant old Canterbury days, an hour
or two. Mr. Wickfield, left to Agnes, soon became more like his former
self; though there was a settled depression upon him, which he never
shook off. For all that, he brightened; and had an evident pleasure in
hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life, many of which he
remembered very well. He said it was like those times, to be alone with
Agnes and me again; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed.
I am sure there was an influence in the placid face of Agnes, and in the
very touch of her hand upon his arm, that did wonders for him.
    My aunt (who was busy nearly all this while with Peggotty, in the inner
room) would not accompany us to the place where they were staying, but
insisted on my going; and I went. We dined together. After dinner,
Agnes sat beside him, as of old, and poured out his wine. He took what
she gave him, and no more-like a child-and we all three sat together at a
window as the evening gathered in. When it was almost dark, he lay
down on a sofa, Agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little
while ; and when she came back to the window, it was not so dark but I
could see tears glittering in her eyes.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   I pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and
truth, at that time of my life; for if I should, I must be drawing near the
end, and then I would desire to remember her best ! She filled my heart
with such good resolutions, strengthened my weakness so, by her example,
so directed-I know not how, she was too modest and gentle to advise
me in many words-the wandering ardor and unsettled purpose within
me, that all the little good I have done, and all the harm I have forborne,
I solemnly believe I may refer to her.
   And how she spoke to me of Dora, sitting at the window in the dark ;
listened to my praises of her ; praised again; and round the little fairy-
figure shed some glimpses of her own pure light, that made it yet more
precious and more innocent to me ! Oh, Agnes, sister of my boyhood,
if I had known then, what I knew long afterwards !-
   There was a beggar in the street, when I went down; and as I turned
my head towards the window, thinking of her calm, seraphic eyes, he
made me start by muttering, as if he were an echo of the morning :
    " Blind ! Blind ! Blind ! "




                          CHAPTER XXXVI.
                               ENTHUSIASM.

    I BEGAN the next day with another dive into the Roman bath, and then
 started for Highgate. I was not dispirited now. I was not afraid of the
shabby coat, and had no yearnings after gallant greys. My whole manner
 of thinking of our late misfortune was changed. What I had to do, was,
to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away
on an insensible, ungrateful object. What I had to do, was, to turn the
painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work with
a resolute and steady heart. What I had to do, was, to take my wood-
man's axe in my hand, and clear my own way through the forest of diffi-
culty, by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora. And I went on
at a mighty rate, as if it could be done by walking.
    When I found myself on the familiar Highgate road, pursuing such a
different errand from that old one of pleasure, with which it was associated,
it seemed as if a complete change had come on my whole life. But that
did not discourage me. With the new life, came new purpose, new inten-
tion. Great was the labor ; priceless the reward. Dora was the reward,
and Dora must be won.
    I got intosuch a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a
little shabby already. I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest
of difficulty, under circumstances that should prove my strength. I had
a good mind to ask an old man, in wire spectacles, who was breaking
stones upon the road, to lend me his hammer for a little while, and let me
begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite. I stimulated myself into
such a heat, and got so out of breath, that I felt as if I had been earning
368           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

I don't know how much. I n this state, I went into a cottage that I saw
was to let, and examined it narrowly,-for I felt it necessary to be prac-
tical. I t would do for me and Dora admirably : with a little front garden
for Jip to run about in, and bark at the tradespeople through the railings,
and a capital room up-stairs for my aunt. I came out again, hotter and
faster than ever, and dashed up to Highgate, at such a rate that I was
there an hour too early ; and, though I had not been, should have been
obliged to stroll about to cool myself, before I was at all presentable.
   My first care, after putting myself under this necessary course of pre-
paration, was to find the Doctor's house. I t was not in that part of
Highgate where Mrs. Steerforth lived, but quite on the opposite side of
the little town. When I had made this discovery, I went back, in an
attraction I could not resist, to a lane by Mrs. Steerforth's, and looked
over the corner of the garden wall. His room was shut up close. The
conservatory doors were standing open, and Kosa Dartle was walking,
bareheaded, with a quick, impetuous step, up and down a gravel walk on
one side of the lawn. She gave me the idea of some fierce thing, that was
dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track, and
wearing its heart out.
   I came softly away from my place of observation, and avoiding that
part of the neighbourhood, and wishing I had not gone near it, strolled
about until it was ten o'clock. The church with the slender spire, that
stands on the top of the hill now, was not there then to tell me the time.
An old red-brick mansion, used as a school, was in its place ; and a fine
old house it must have been to go to school at, as I recollect it.
   When I approached the Doctor's cottage-a pretty old place, on which
he seemed to have expended some money, if I might judge from the
embellishments and repairs that had the look of being just completed-
I saw him walking in the garden at the side, gaiters and all, as if he had
never left off walking since the days of my pupilage. He had his old
companions about him, too ; for there were plenty of high trees in the
neighbourhood, and too or three rooks were on the grass, looking after
him, as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury rooks,
and were observing him closely in consequence.
   Knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that
distance, I made bold to open the gate, and walk after him, so as to meet
him when he should turn round. When he did, and came towards me, he
looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments, evidently without thinking
about me at all ; and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary plea-
sure, and he took me by both hands.
   "Why, my dear Copperfield," said the Doctor; " youare a man ! How
do you do ? I am delighted to see you. My dear Copperfield, how very
much you have improved ! You are quite-yes-dear          me ! "
   I hoped he was well, and Mrs. Strong too.
   " Oh dear, yes ! " said the Doctor ; " Annie 's quite well, and she '11 be

delighted to see you. You were always her favorite. She said so,
last night, when I showed her your letter. And-yes to be sure-you
recollect Mr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield? "
    " Perfectly, sir."

    " Of course," said the Doctor.  " To be sure. He 's pretty well, too."
    " Has he come home, sir ? " I inquired.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           369
    " From India ? " said the Doctor.     " Yes. Mr. Jack Maldon couldn't
bear the climate, my dear. Mrs. Markleham-you           have not forgotten
Mrs. Markleham? "
   Forgotten the Old Soldier ! And in that short time !
   " Mrs. Markleham," said the Doctor, " was quite vexed about him,

poor thing ; so we have got him at home again; and we have bought him
a little Patent place, which agrees with him much better."
    I knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect from this account that
it was a place where there was not much to do, and which was pretty well
paid. The Doctor, walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder,
and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine, went on :
    " Now, my dear Copperfield, in reference to this proposal of yours. I t ' s

very gratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but don't you think you
could do better? You achieved distinction, you know, when you were
with us. You are qualified for many good things. You have laid a
foundation that any edifice may be raised upon ; and is it not a pity that
you should devote the spring-time of your life to such a poor pursuit as I
can offer ? "
    I became very glowing again, and, expressing myself in a rhapsodical
 style, I am afraid, urged my request strongly ; reminding the Doctor that
 I had already a profession.
    " Well, well," returned the Doctor, " that's true. Certainly, your
having a profession, and being actually engaged in studying it, makes a
difference. But, my good young friend, what's seventy pounds a-year ? '
    " I t doubles our income, Doctor Strong," said I.
    " Dear me ! " replied the Doctor.     " To think of that !   Not that I
mean to say it's rigidly limited to seventy pounds a-year, because I have
always contemplated making any young friend I might thus employ, a
present too. Undoubtedly," said the Doctor, still walking me up and
down with his hand on my shoulder, " I have always taken an annual
present into account."
   " My dear tutor," said I (now, really, without any nonsense), " to whom

I owe more obligations already than I ever can acknowledge-"
   '' NO,no," interposed the Doctor. " Pardon me ! "
   " If you will take such time as I have, and that is my mornings and

evenings, and can think it worth seventy pounds a-year, you will do me
such a service as I cannot express."
    "Dear me ! " said the Doctor, innocently. " To think that so little
should go for so much ! Dear, dear ! And when you can do better, yon
will? On your word, now? " said the Doctor,-which he had always
made a very grave appeal to the honor of us boys.
    " On my word, sir ! " I returned, answering in our old school manner.
    " Then be it so ! " said the Doctor, clapping me on the shoulder, and

still keeping his hand there, as we still walked up and down.
    "And I shall be twenty times happier, sir," said I, with a little-I
hope innocent-flattery, "if my employment is to be on the Dictionary."
    The Doctor stopped, smilingly clapped me on the shoulder again, and
exclaimed, with a triumph most delightful to behold, as if I had penetrated
to the profoundest depths of mortal sagacity, " My dear young friend,
you have hit it. It IS the Dictionary ! "
                                                               B B
370           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   How could it be anything else ! His pockets were as full of it as his
head. I t was sticking out of him in all directions. He told me that
since his retirement from scholastic life, he had been advancing with it
wonderfully; and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed
arrangements for morning and evening work, as it was his custom to walk
about in the day-time with his considering cap on. His papers were in
a little confusion, in consequence of Mr. Jack Maldon having lately
proffered his occasional services as an amanuensis, and not being accus-
tomed to that occupation ; but we should soon put right what was amiss,
and go on swimmingly. Afterwards, when we were fairly at our work, I
found Mr. Jack Maldon's efforts more troublesome to me than I had
expected, as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes,
but had sketched so many soldiers, and ladies' heads, over the Doctor's
manuscript, that I often became involved in labyrinths of obscurity.
   The Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work
together on that wonderful performance, and we settled to begin next
morning at seven o'clock. We were to work two hours every morning,
and two or three hours every night, except on Saturdays, when I was to
rest. On Sundays, of course, I was to rest also, and I considered these
very easy terms.
   Our plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction, the Doctor
took me into the house to present me to Mrs. Strong, whom we found in
the Doctor's new study, dusting his books,-a freedom which he never
permitted anybody else to take with those sacred favorites.
   They had postponed their breakfast on my account, and we sat down to
table together. We had not been seated long, when I saw an approaching
arrival in Mrs. Strong's face, before I heard any sound of it. A gentleman
on horseback came to the gate, and, leading his horse into the little court,
with the bridle over his arm, as if he were quite at home, tied him to a ring
in the empty coach-house wall, and came into the breakfast parlor, whip in
hand. It was Mr. Jack Maldon ; and Mr. Jack Maldon was not at all
improved by India, I thought. I was in a state of ferocious virtue, how-
ever, as to young men who were not cutting down the trees in the forest
of difficulty; and my impression must be received with due allowance.
   "Mr. Jack ! " said the Doctor, " Copperfield ! "
   Mr. Jack Maldon shook hands with me; but not very warmly, I
believed ; and with an air of languid patronage, at which I secretly took
great umbrage. But his languor altogether was quite a wonderful sight;
except when he addressed himself to his cousin Annie.
   "Have you breakfasted this morning, Mr. Jack? " said the Doctor.
   "I hardly ever take breakfast, sir," he replied, with his head thrown
back in an easy chair. "I find it bores me."
   " I s there any news to-day ? " inquired the Doctor.
   " Nothing at all, sir," replied Mr. Maldon.        " There 's an account

about the people being hungry and discontented down in the North, but
they are always being hungry and discontented somewhere."
   The Doctor looked grave, and said, as though he wished to change the
subject, "Then there's no news at all ; and no news, they say, is good news."
   " There's    a long statement in the papers, sir, about a murder,"
 observed Mr. Maldon. " But somebody is always being murdered, and I
 didn't read it."
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           37'1
      A display of indifference to all the actions and passions of mankind was
   not supposed to be such a distinguished quality at that time, I think, as I
  have observed it to be considered since. I have known it very fashion-
  able indeed. I have seen it displayed with such success, that I have
  encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been
  born caterpillars. Perhaps it impressed me the more then, because it
  was new to me, but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of, or to
  strengthen my confidence in, Mr. Jack Maldon.
      " I came out to inquire whether Annie would like to go to the opera

  to-night," said Mr. Maldon, turning to her. " I t 's the last good night
  there will be, this season; and there's a singer there, whom she really
  ought to hear. She is perfectly exquisite. Besides which, she is so
  charmingly ugly," relapsing into languor.
      The Doctor, ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife,
  turned to her and said :
      "You must go, Annie. You must go."
      "I would rather not," she said to the Doctor. "I prefer to remain at
  home. I would much rather remain at home."
      Without looking at her cousin, she then addressed me, and asked me
  about Agnes, and whether she should see her, and whether she was not
  likely to come that day; and was so much disturbed, that I wondered
  how even the Doctor, buttering his toast, could be blind to what was so
  obvious.
     But he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, that she was young
  and ought to be amused and entertained, and must not allow herself to
  be made dull by a dull old fellow. Moreover, he said, he wanted to hear
 her sing all the new singer's songs to him; and how could she do that
 well, unless she went ? So the Doctor persisted in making the engage-
 ment for her, and Mr. Jack Maldon was to come back to dinner. This
 concluded, he went to his Patent place, I suppose ; but at all events went
 away on his horse, looking very idle.
     I was curious to find out next morning, whether she had been. She
 had not, but had sent into London to put her cousin off; and had gone
 out in the afternoon to see Agnes, and had prevailed upon the Doctor to
 go with her; and they had walked home by the fields, the Doctor told me,
 the evening being delightful. I wondered then, whether she would have
gone if Agnes had not been in town, and whether Agnes had some good
influence over her too !
    She did not look very happy, I thought; but it was a good face, or a
very false one. I often glanced at it, for she sat in the window all the
time we were at work; and made our breakfast, which we took by
snatches as we were employed. When I left, at nine o'clock, she was
kneelmg on the ground at the Doctor's feet, putting on his shoes and
gaiters for him. There was a softened shade upon her face, thrown from
some green leaves overhanging the open window of the low room ; and I
thought all the way to Doctors' Commons, of the night when I had seen it
looking at him as he read.
    I was pretty busy now ; up at five in the morning, and home at nine or
ten at night. But I had infinite satisfaction in being so closely engaged,
and never walked slowly on any account, and felt enthusiastically that the

372            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 more I tired myself, the more I was doing to deserve Dora. I had not
 revealed myself in my altered character to Dora get, because she was
 coming to see Miss Mills in a few days, and I deferred all I had to tell
 her until then ; merely informing her in my letters (all our communica-
 tions were secretly forwarded through Miss Mills), that I had much to tell
 her. I n the meantime, I put myself on a short allowance of bear's grease,
 wholly abandoned scented soap and lavender water, and sold off three
 waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice, as being too luxurious for my stern
 career.
    Not satisfied with all these proceedings, but burning with impatience
 to do something more, I went to see Traddles, now lodging up behind the
 parapet of a house in Castle Street, Holborn. Mr. Dick, who had been
 with me to Highgate twice already, and had resumed his companionship
 with the Doctor, I took with me.
    I took Mr. Dick with me, because, acutely sensitive to my aunt's
 reverses, and sincerely believing that no galley-slave or convict worked as
 I did, he had begun to fret and worry himself out of spirits and appetite,
 as having nothing useful to do. Tu this condition, he felt more incapable
 of finishing the Memorial than ever ; and the harder he worked at it, the
 oftener that unlucky head of I<ing Charles the First got into it. Seriously
 apprehending that his malady would increase, unless we put some innocent
 deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was useful, or
unless we could put him in the way of being really useful (which would
be better), I made up my mind to try if Traddles could help us. Before
we went, 1wrote Traddles a full statement of all that had happened, and
Traddles wrote me back a capital answer, expressive of his sympathy and
friendship.
    We found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers, refreshed by
the sight of the flowerpot-stand and the little round table in a corner of the
 small apartment. He received us cordially, and made friends with Mr.
Dick in a moment. Mr. Dick professed an absolute certainty of having
 seen him before, and we both said, " Very likely."
    The first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this.-I had
heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life
by reporting the debates in Parliament. Traddles having mentioned news-
papers to me, as one of his hopes, I had put the two things together,
and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I could
qualify myself for this pursuit. Traddles now informed me, as the result
of his inquiries, that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary, except
in rare cases, for thorough excellence in it, that is to say, a perfect and
entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and reading, was
about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages; and that it
might perhaps be attained, by dint of perseverance, in the course of a
few years. Traddles reasonably supposed that this would settle the
business; but I, only feeling that here indeed were a few tall trees to be
hewn down, immediately resolved to work my way on to Dora through
this thicket, axe in hand.
    " I am very much obliged to you, my dear Traddles ! " said I. " I'll
begin to-morrow."
   Traddles looked astonished, as he well might; but he had no notion as
yet of my rapturous condition.
                         OF DAVID COPPERPIELD.                            373
  'I   I '11 buy a book," said I, "with a good scheme of this art in it ; I '11
 work at it at the Commons, where I haven't half enough to do ; I '11 take
 down the speeches in our court for practice-Traddles, my dear fellow,
I 1' 1 master it ! "
     "Dear me," said Traddles, opening his eyes, " I had no idea you were
 such a determined character, Copperfield ! "
     I don't know how he should have had, for it was new enough to me.
I passed that off, and brought Mr. Dick on the carpet.
     " You see," said Mr. Dick, wistfully, " if I could exert myself, Mr. Trad-
dles-if I could beat a drum-or blow anything ! "
    Poor fellow! I have little doubt he would have preferred such an
employment in his heart to all others. Traddles, who would not have
smiled for the world, replied composedly:
     "But you are a very good penman, sir. You told me so, Copperfield? "
       Excellent!" said I. And indeed he was. He wrote with extra-
ordinary neatness.
     "Don't you think," said Traddles, "you could copy writings, sir, if
I got them for you? "
     Mr. Dick looked doubtfully at me. " Eh, Trotwood? "
     I shook my head. Mr. Dick shook his, and sighed. " Tell him about
 the Memorial," said Mr. Dick.
     I explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping Icing
 Charles the First out of Mr. Dick's manuscripts ; Mr. Dick in the mean-
while looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles, and sucking
his thumb.
     "But these writings, you know, that I speak of, are already drawn
up and finished," said Traddles after a little consideration. " Mr. Dick
has nothing to do with them. Wouldn't that make a difference, Copper-
field? At all events wouldn't it be well to try ? "
     This gave us new hope. Traddles and I laying our heads together
apart, while Mr. Dick anxiously watched us from his chair, we con-
cocted a scheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day, with
triumphant success.
     On a table by the window in Buckingham Street, we set out the work
Traddles procured for him-which was to make, I forget how many
copies of a legal document about some right of way-and onanother table
we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial. Our
instructions to Mr. Dick were that he should copy exactly what he had
before him, without the least departure from the original; and that when
he felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to King Charles the
First, he should fly to the Memorial. We exhorted him to be resolute in
this, and left my aunt to observe him. Rly aunt reported to us, after-
wards, that, at first, he was like a man playing the kettle-drums, and
constantly divided his attentions between the two ; but that, finding this
confuse and fatigue him, and having his copy there, plainly before his
eyes, he soon sat at it in an orderly business-like manner, and postponed
the Memorial to a more convenient time. I n a word, although we took
great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him, and
although he did not begin with the beginning of a week, he earned by the
following Saturday night ten shillings and nine pence; and never, while
I live, shall I forget his going about to all the shops in the neighbourhood
              THE   PERSONAL    HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

to change this treasure into sixpences, or his bringing them to my aunt
arranged in the form of a heart upon a waiter, with tears of joy and pride
in his eyes. He was like one under the propitious influence of a charm,
from the moment of his being usefully employed; and if there were a
happy man in the world, that Saturday night, it was the grateful creature
who thought my aunt the most wonderful woman in existence, and me the
most wonderful young man.
   "No starving now, Trotwood," said Mr. Dick, shaking hands with me
in a corner. " I'll provide for her, sir ! " and he flourished his ten fingers
in the air, as if they were ten banks.
   I hardly know which was the better pleased, Traddles or I. " I t
really," said Traddles, suddenly, taking a letter out of his pocket, and
giving it to me, " put Mr. Micawber quite out of my head ! "
   The letter (Mr. Micawber never missed any possible opportunity of
writing a letter) was addressed to me, "By the kindness of T. Traddles,
Esquire, of the Inner Temple." It ran thus :-
  " MY DEAR COPPERFIELD,
            " You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation
that something has turned up. I may have mentioned to you on a former
occasion that I was in expectation of such an event.
   " I am about to establish myself in one of the provincial towns of our
favored island, (where the society may be described as a happy admixture
of the agricultural and the clerical), in immediate connexion with one of
the learned professions. Mrs. Micawber and our offspring will accompany
me. Our ashes, at a future period, will probably be found commingled
in the cemetery attached to a venerable pile, for which the spot to which
I refer, has acquired a reputation, shall I say from China to Peru ?
   " I n bidding adieu to the modern Babylon, where we have undergone

many vicissitudes, I trust not ignobly, Mrs. Micawber and myself cannot
disguise from our minds that we part, it may be for years and it may be
for ever, with an individual linked by strong associations to the altar of
our domestic life. If, on the eve of such a departure, you will accom-
pany our mutual friend, Mr. Thomas Traddles, to our present abode,
and there reciprocate the wishes natural to the occasion, you will confer
a Boon
               'i On
                   " One

                       " Who

                          '( Is
                               " Ever yours,
                                           " WILKINS MICAWBER."


  I was glad to find that Mr. Micawber had got rid of his dust and ashes,
and that something really had turned up at last. Learning from Traddles
that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away, I expressed
my readiness to do honor to i t ; and we went off together to the lodging
which Mr. Micawber occupied as Mr. Mortimer, and which was situated
near the top of the Gray's Inn Road.
  The resources of this lodging were so limited, that we found the twins,
now some eight or nine years old, reposing in a turn-up bedstead in the
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          375
family sitting-room, where Mr. Micawber had prepared, in a wash-hand-
stand jug, what he called " a Brew" of the agreeable beverage for which
he was famous. I had the pleasure, on this occasion, of renewing the
acquaintance of Master Micawber, whom I found a promising boy of
about twelve or thirteen, very subject to that restlessness of limb which is
not an unfrequent phenomenon in youths of his age. I also became once
more known to his sister, Miss Micawber, in whom, as Mr. Micawber told
us, "her mother renewed her youth, like the Phoenix."
    " My dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, " yourself and Mr.Traddles
find us on the brink of migration, and will excuse any little discomforts
incidental to that position."
    Glancing round as I made a suitable reply, I observed that the family
effects were already packed, and that the amount of luggage was by no
means overwhelming. I congratulated Mrs. Micawber on the approaching
change.
    " My dear Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber, " of your friendly
interest in all our affairs, I am well assured. My family may consider it
 banishment, if they please; but I am a wife and mother, and I never
 will desert Mr. Micawber."
    Traddles, appealed to, by Mrs. Micawber's eye, feelingly acquiesced.
     " That," said Mrs. Micawber, " that, at least, is my view, my dear
  Mr. Copperfield and Mr. Traddles, of the obligation which I took upon
 myself when I repeated the irrevocable words, ' I, Emma, take thee,
 Wilkins.' I read the service over with a flat-candle on the previous
 night, and the conclusion I derived from it was, that I never could
 desert Mr. Micawber. And," said Mrs. Micawber, " though it is pos-
 sible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony, I never will! "
    " My dear,"    said Mr. Micawber, a little impatiently, " I am not
 conscious that you are expected to do any thing of the sort."
    " I am aware, my dear Mr. Copperfield," pursued Mrs. Micawber,

 " that I am now about to cast my lot among strangers; and I am also

 aware that the various members of my family, to whom Mr. Micawher has
 written in the most gentlemanly terms, announcing that fact, have not
 taken the least notice of Mr. Micawber's communication. Indeed I may
 be superstitious," said Mrs. Micawber, " but it appears to me that
 Mr. Micawber is destined never to receive any answers whatever to the
 great majority of the communications he writes. I may augur, from the
 silence of my family, that they object to the resolution I have taken ; but
 I should not allow myself to be swerved from the path of duty, Mr.
 Copperfield, even by my papa and mama, were they still living."
    1expressed my opinion that this was going in the right direction.
     " I t may be a sacrifice," said Mrs. Micawber, " to immure one's-self

 in a Cathedral town; but surely, Mr. Copperfield, if it is a sacrifice in
 me, it is much more a sacrifice in a man of Mr. Micawber's abilities."
     " Oh ! You are going to a Cathedral town?" said I.
    Mr. Micawber, who had been helping us all, out of the wash-hand-
 stand jug, replied :
     " To Canterbury. I n fact, my dear Copperfield, I have entered into
 arrangements, by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted to our
 friend Heep, to assist and serve him in the capacity of-and to be-his
 confidential clerk."
376           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   I stared at Mr. Micawber, who greatly enjoyed my surprise.
   " I am bound to state to you," he said, with an official air, " that the

 business habits, and the prudent suggestions, of Mrs. Micawber, have in
 a great measure conduced to this result. The gauntlet, to which Mrs.
 Micawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown down in the
 form of an advertisement, was taken up by my friend Heep, and led to a
 mutual recognition. Of my friend Heep," said Mr. Micawber, " who is a
 man of remarkable shrewdness, I desire to speakwith all possible respect.
 My friend Heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a
 figure, but he has made a great deal, in the way of extrication from the
 pressure of pecuniary difficulties, contingent on the value of my services ;
 and on the value of those services I pin my faith. Such address and
 intelligence as I chance to possess," said Mr. Micawber, boastfully
 disparaging himself, with the old genteel air, " will be devoted to my
 friend Heep's service. I have already some acquaintance with the law-
 as a defendant on civil process-and I shall immediately apply myself to
 the Commentaries of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our
 English Jurists. I believe it is unnecessary to add that I allude to
 Mr. Justice Blackstone."
    These observations, and indeed the greater part of the observations made
 that evening, were interrupted by Mrs. Micawber's discovering that Master
 Micawber was sitting on his boots, or holding his head on with both arms
 as if he felt it loose, or accidentally kicking Traddles under the table, or
 shuffling his feet over one another, or producing them at distances from
 himself apparently outrageous to nature, or lying sideways with his hair
 among the wine-glasses, or developing his restlessness of limb in some
 other form incompatible with the general interests of society; and by
 Master Micawber's receiving those discoveries in a resentful spirit. I sat
 all the while, amazed by Mr. Micawber's disclosure, and wondering what
 it meant; until Mrs. Micawber resumed the thread of the discourse, and
 claimed my attention.
    " What I particularly request Mr. Micawber to be careful of, is," said

 Mrs. Micawber, " that he does not, my dear Mr. Copperfield, in applying
 himself to this subordinate branch of the law, place it out of his power to
rise, ultimately, to the top of the tree. I am convinced that Mr.
Micawber, giving his mind to a profession so adapted to his fertile
resources, and his flow of language, must distinguish himself. Now, for
example, Mr. Traddles," said Mrs. Micawber, assuming a profound air,
'< a Judge, or even say a Chancellor.       Does an individual place himself
beyond the pale of those preferments by entering on such an office as
Mr. Micawber has accepted?"
    " My dear," observed Mr. Micawber-but glancing inquisitively at
Traddles, too; " we have time enough      - before us, for the consideration
of those questions."
    " Micawber," she returned, "no ! Your mistake in life is, that you do
not look forward far enough. You are bound, in justice to your family,
if not to yourself, to take in at a comprehensive glance the extremest point
in the horizon to which your abilities may lead you.
    Mr. Micawber coughed, and drank his punch with an air of exceeding
satisfaction-still glancing a t Traddles, as if he desired to have his
opinion.
                         OF DAVID C O P P E R F I E L D .                 377
    "Why, the plain state of the case, Mrs. Micawber," said Traddles, mildly
breaking the truth to her, " I mean the real prosaic fact, you know-"
    " Just so," said Mrs. Micawber, " my dear Mr. Traddles, I wish to be

as prosaic and literal as possible on a subject of so much importance."
    "-Is,"   said Traddles, " that this branch of the law, even if Mr. Micawber
were a regular solicitor-"
    " Exactly so," returned Mrs. Micawber.       (" Wilkius, you are squinting,
and will not be able to get your eyes back.")
    "-Has nothing," pursued Traddles, "to do with that. Only a barrister
is eligible for such preferments ; and Mr. Micawber could not be a bar-
rister, without being entered at an inn of court as a student, for
five years."
    " Do I follow you ? " said Mrs. Micawber, with her most affable air

of business. "Do I understand, my dear Mr. Traddles, that, at the
expiration of that period, Mr. Micawber would be eligible as a Judge
or Chancellor ? "
    " He would be eligible," returned Traddles, with a strong emphasis on

that word."
    "Thank you," said Mrs. Micawber. "That is quite sufficient. If
such is the case, and Mr. Micawber forfeits no privilege by entering on
these duties, my anxiety is set at rest. I speak," said Mrs. Micawber,
 "as a female, necessarily; but I have always been of opinion that Mr.
Micawber possesses what I have heard my papa call, when I lived at home,
the judicial mind; and I hope Mr. Micawber is now entering on a field
where that mind will develope itself, and take a commanding station."
    I quite believe that Mr. Micawber saw himself, in his judicial mind's
eye, on the woolsack. He passed his hand complacently over his bald
head, and said with ostentatious resignation :
    "My dear, we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune. If I am
reserved to wear a wig, I am at least prepared, externally," in allusion to
his baldness, "for that distinction. I do not," said Mr. Micawber,
 " regret my hair, and I may have been deprived of it for a specific purpose.
I cannot say. It is my intention, my dear Copperfield, to educate my son
for the Church ; I will not deny that I should be happy, on his account, to
 attain to eminence."
     "For the Church?" said I, still pondering, betweenwhiles, on Uriah Heep.
     " Yes," said Mr. Micawber.       " He has a remarkable head-voice, and
 will commence as a chorister. Our residence at Canterbury, and our
 local connexion, will, no doubt, enable him to take advantage of any
 vacancy that may arise in the Cathedral corps.
    On looking at Master Micawber again, I saw that he had a certain
 expression of face, as if his voice were behind his eyebrows; where it
presently appeared to be, on his singing us (as an alternative between that
 and bed) " The Wood-Pecker tapping." After many compliments on this
performance, we fell into some general conversation ; and as I was too full
 of my desperate intentions to keep my altered circumstances to myself, I
made them known to Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. I cannot express how
 extremely delighted they both were, by the idea of my aunt's being in
 difficulties ; and how comfortable and friendly it made them.
    When we were nearly come to the last round of the punch, I addressed
myself to Traddles, alld reminded him that we must not separate, without
378            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

wishing our friends health, happiness, and success in their new career. I
begged Mr. Micawber to fill us bumpers, and proposed the toast in due
form : shaking hands with him across the table, and kissing Mrs. Micawber,
to commemorate that eventful occasion. Traddles imitated me in the
first particular, but did not consider himself a sufficiently old friend to
venture on the second.
   " My dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, rising with one of his thumbs
in each of his waistcoat pockets, "the companion of my youth : if I may
be allowed the expression-and my esteemed friend Traddles : if I may be
permitted to call him so-will allow me, on the part of Mrs. Micawber,
myself, and our offspring, to thank them in the warmest and most uncom-
promising terms for their good wishes. I t may be expected that on the
eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new existence,"
Mr. Micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred thousand miles,
"I should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such friends as I see
before me. But all that I have to say in this way, I have said. Whatever
station in society I may attain, through the medium of the learned profes-
sion of which I am about to become an unworthy member, I shall
endeavour not to disgrace, and Mrs. Micawber will be safe to adorn.
Under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities, contracted with a
view to their immediate liquidation, but remaining unliquidated through
a combination of circumstances, I have been under the necessity of
assuming a garb from which my natural instincts recoil-I allude to
spectacles-and possessing myself of a cognomen, to which I can establish
no legitimate pretensions. All I have to say on that score is, that the
cloud has passed from the dreary scene, and the God of Day is once more
high upon the mountain tops. On Monday next, on the arrival of the
four o'clock afternoon coach at Canterbury, my foot will be on my native
heath-my name, Micawber ! "
   Mr. Micawber resumed his seat on the close of these remarks, and drank
two glasses of punch in grave succession. H e then said with much
solemnity :
   " One thing more I have to do, before this separation is complete, and

that is to perform an act of justice. My friend Mr. Thomas Traddles
has, on two several occasions, 'put his name,' if I may use a common
expression, to bills of exchange for my accommodation. On the first
occasion Mr. Thomas Traddles was left-let me say, in short, in the lurch.
The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived. The amount of the first
obligation," here Mr. Micawber carefully referred to papers, "was, I
believe, twenty-three, four, nine and a half; of the second, according to
my entry of that transaction, eighteen, six, two. These sums, united,
make a total, if my calculation is correct, amounting to forty-one, ten, eleven
and a half. My friend Copperfield will perhaps do me the favor to check
that total ? "
   I did so and found it correct.
   " To leave this metropolis," said Mr. Micawber, " and my friend Mr.
Thomas Traddles, without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this
obligation, would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent. I
 have, therefore, prepared for my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, and I now
 hold in my hand, a document, which accomplishes the desired object. I
 beg to hand to my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles my I. 0. U. for forty-one,
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

ten, eleven and a half; and I am happy to recover my moral dignity, and
to know that I can once more walk erect before my fellow man ! "
   With this introduction (which greatly affected him), Mr. Micawber
placed his I. 0.U. in the hands of Traddles, and said he wished him well
in every relation of life. I am persuaded, not only that this was quite the
same to Mr. Micawber as paying the money, but that Traddles himself
hardly knew the difference until he had had time to think about it.
   Mr. Micawber walked so erect before his fellow man, on the strength of
this virtuous action, that his chest looked half as broad again when he
lighted us down stairs. We parted with great heartiness on both sides ;
and when I had seen Traddles to his own door, and was going home alone,
I thought, among the other odd and contradictory things I mused upon,
that, slippery as Mr. Micawber was, I was probably indebted to some com-
passionate recollection he retained of me as his boy-lodger, for never having
been asked by him for money. I certainly should not have had the moral
courage to refuse it ; and I have no doubt he knew that (to his credit be
it written), quite as well as I did.




                          CHAPTER XXXVII.
                         A LITTLE     COLD WATER.

   MYnew life had lasted for more than a week, and I was stronger than ever
in those tremendous practical resolutions that I felt the crisis required. I
continued to walk extremely fast, and to have a general idea that I was
getting on. I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as I possibly
could, in my way of doing everything to which I applied my energies. I
made a perfect victim of myself. I even entertained some idea of putting
myself on avegetable diet, vaguely conceiving that, in becoming a gramini-
vorous animal, I should sacrifice to Dora.
   As yet, little Dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness,
otherwise than as my letters darkly shadowed it forth. But, another
Saturday came, and on that Saturday evening she was to be at Miss
Mills's ; and when Mr. Mills had gone to his whist-club (telegraphed to me
in the street, by a bird-cage in the drawing-room middle window), I was to
go there to tea.
   By this time, we were quite settled down in Buckingham Street, where
Mr. Dick continued his copying in a state of absolute felicity. My aunt
had obtained a signal victory over Mrs. Crupp, by paying her off, throw-
ing the first pitcher she planted on the stairs out of window, and protecting
in person, up and down the staircase, a supernumerary whom she engaged
from the outer world. These vigorous measures struck such terror to
the breast of Mrs. Crupp, that she subsided into her own kitchen, under
the impression that my aunt was mad. My aunt being supremely indif-
ferent to Mrs. Crupp's opinion and everybody else's, and rather favoring
than discouraging the idea, Mrs. Crupp, of late the bold, became within a
380           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

few days so faint-hearted, that rather than encounter my aunt upon the
staircase, she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind doors-
leaving visible, however, a wide margin of flannel petticoat-or would
shrink into dark corners. This gave my aunt such unspeakable satisfac-
tion, that I believe she took a delight in prowling up and down, with her
bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head, at times when Mrs. Crupp
was likely to be in the way.
   My aunt, being uncommonly neat and ingenious, made so many little
improvements in our domestic arrangements, that I seemed to be richer
instead of poorer. Among the rest, she converted the pantry into a
dressing-room for me ; and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my
occupation, which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime, as a bedstead
could. I was the object of her constant solicitude; and my poor mother
herself could not have loved me better, or studied more how to make me
happy.
   Peggotty had considered herself highly privileged in being allowed to
participate in these labors ; and, although she still retained something of
her old sentiment of awe in reference to my aunt, had received so many
marks of encouragement and confidence, that they were the best friends
possible. But the time had now come (I am speaking of the Saturday
when I was to take tea at Miss Mills's) when it was necessary for her to
return home, and enter on the discharge of the duties she had undertaken
in behalf of Ham. "So good bye, Barkis," said my aunt, "and take care
of yourself! I am sure I never thought I could be sorry to lose you ! "
   I took Peggotty to the coach-office, and saw her off. She cried at
parting, and confided her brother to my friendship as Ham had done. We
had heard nothing of him since he went away, that sunny afternoon.
   'r And now, my own dear Davy," said Peggotty, "if, while you're a
prentice, you should want any money to spend; or if, when you're out of
your time, my dear, you should want any to set you up (and you must do
one or other, or both, my darling) ; who has such a good right to ask
leave to lend it you, as my sweet girl's own old stupid me ! "
   I was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply, but that
if ever I borrowed money of anyone, I would borrow it of her. Next to
accepting a large sum on the spot, I believe this gave Peggotty more com-
fort than anything I could have done.
   "And, my dear ! " whispered Peggotty, "tell the pretty little angel
that I should so have liked to see her, only for a minute ! And tell her
that before she marries my boy, I'll come and make your house so beau-
tiful for you, if you '11 let me ! "
   I declared that nobody else should touch i t ; and this gave Peggotty
such delight that she went away in good spirits.
   I fatigued myself as much as I possibly could in the Commons all day,
by a variety of devices, and at the appointed time in the evening repaired
to Mr. Mills's street. Mr. Mills, who was a terrible fellow to fall asleep
after dinner, had not yet gone out, and there was no birdcage in the middle
window.
   He kept me waiting so long, that I fervently hoped the Club would fine
him for being late. At last he came out; and then I saw my own Dora
hang up the birdcage, and peep into the balcony to look for me, and run
 in again when she saw I was there, while Jip remained behind, to bark
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            381
injuriously at an immense butcher's dog in the street, who could have
 taken him like a pill.
    Dora came to the drawing-room door to meet me; and Jip came
 scrambling out, tumbling over his own growls, under the impression
 that I was a Bandit; and we all three went in, as happy and loving as
 could be. I soon carried desolation into the bosom of our joys-not that
 I meant to do it, but that I was so full of the subject-by asking Dora,
 without the smallest preparation, if she could love a beggar?
    My pretty, little, startled Dora ! Her only association with the word
 was a yellow face and a nightcap, or a pair of crutches, or a wooden leg,
 or a dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth, or something of that kind;
 and she stared at me with the most delightful wonder.
    " How can you ask me anything so foolish!" pouted Dora.          " Love a
beggar ! "
    " Dora, my own dearest ! " said I.     "Iam a beggar ! "
    " How can you be such a silly thing," replied Dora, slapping my hand,

 " as to sit there, telling such stories ? I'll make Jip bite you ! "
    Her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me, but it
 was necessary to be explicit, and I solemnly repeated :
    "Dora, my own life, I am your ruined David ! "
    " I declare I '11 make Jip bite you ! " said Dora, shaking her curls, " if

 you are so ridiculous."
    But I looked so serious, that Dora left off shaking her curls, and laid her
 trembling little hand upon my shoulder, and first looked scared and anxious,
then began to cry. That was dreadful. I fell upon my knees before the
 sofa, caressing her, and imploring her not to rend my heart; but, for some
time, poor little Dora did nothing but exclaim Oh dear ! oh dear!
And oh, she was so frightened ! And where was Julia Mills ! And oh, take
her to Julia Mills, and go away, please ! until I was almost beside myself.
    At last, after an agony of supplication and protestation, I got Dora to
look at me, with a horrified expression of face, which I gradually soothed
until it was only loving, and her soft, pretty cheek was lying against mine.
Then I told her, with my arms clasped round her, how I loved her, so
dearly, and so dearly; how I felt it right to offer to release her from her
engagement, because now I was poor ; how I never could bear it, or recover
it, if I lost her ; how I had no fears of poverty, if she had none, my arm
being nerved and my heart inspired by her; how I was already working
with a courage such as none but lovers knew; how I had begun to be
practical, and to look into the future ; how a crust well earned was sweeter
far than a feast inherited ; and much more to the same purpose, which I
delivered in a burst of passionate eloquence quite surprising to myself,
though I had been thinking about it, day and night, ever since my aunt
had astonished me.
    " Is your heart mine still, dear Dora ? " said I, rapturously, for I knew
by her clinging to me that it was.
    " Oh, yes ! " cried Dora.      " Oh, yes, it's all yours. Oh, don't be
dreadful ! "
   I dreadful ! To Dora !
    " Don't talk about being poor, and working hard ! " said Dora, nestling

closer to me. " Oh, don't, don't ! "
   '' My dearest love," said I, " the crust well-earned- "
382            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Oh, yes ; but I don't want to hear any more about crusts ! " said Dora.
 "And Jip must have a mutton-chop every-day at twelve, or he '11 die ! "
    I was charmed with her childish, winning way. I fondly explained to
Dora that Jip should have his mutton-chop with his accustomed regularity.
I drew a picture of our frugal home, made independent by my labor-
 sketching-in the little house I had seen at Highgate, and my aunt in her
room up-stairs.
   " I am not dreadful now, Dora ? " said I, tenderly.

   " Oh, no, no ! " cried Dora. " But I hope your aunt. will keep in her
own room a good deal! And I hope she's not a scolding old thing ! "
   If it were possible for me to love Dora more than ever, I am sure I did.
But I felt she was a little impracticable. I t damped my new-born ardor, to
find that ardor so difficult of communication to her. I made another
trial. When she was quite herself again, and was curling Jip's ears, as he
lay upon her lap, I became grave, and said ;
   " My own ! May I mention something? "
   " Oh, please don't be practical! " said Dora, coaxingly. " Because it
frightens me so ! "
   " Sweet heart ! " I returned ; "there is nothing to alarm you in all

this. I want you to think of it quite differently. I want to make it nerve
you, and inspire you, Dora ! "
   " Oh, but that 's so shocking ! " cried Dora.
   " My love, no. Perseverance and strength of character will enable us
to bear much worse things."
    "But I haven't got any strength at all," said Dora, shaking her curls.
 " Have I , Jip? Oh, do kiss Jip, and be agreeable ! "
   I t was impossible to resist kissing Jip, when she held him up to me for
that purpose, putting her own bright, rosy little mouth into kissing form,
as she directed the operation, which she insisted should be performed
symmetrically, on the centre of his nose. I did as she bade me-rewarding
myself afterwards for my obedience-and she charmed me out of my
graver character for I don't know how long.
   " But, Dora, my beloved ! " said I, at last resuming it ; "I was going

to mention something."
   The Judge of the Prerogative Court might have fallen in love with her,
to see her fold her little hands and hold them up, begging and praying me
not to be dreadful any more.
   " Indeed I am not going to be, my darling ! " I assured her. "But,
Dora, my love, if you will sometimes think,-not despondingly, you know;
far from that !-but if you will sometimes think-just to encourage your-
self-that yon are engaged to a poor man-"
   "Don't, don't ! Pray don't ! " cried Dora. " I t 's so very dreadful !"
   "My soul, not at all ! " said I, cheerfully. " If you will sometimes
think of that, and look about now and then at your papa's housekeeping,
and endeavour to acquire a little habit-of accounts, for instance-"
   Poor little Dora received this suggestion with something that was half
a sob and half a scream.
   "-It will be so useful to us afterwards," I went on. "And if you
would promise me to read a little-a little Cookery Book that I would
send you, it would be so excellent for both of us. For our path in life,
my Dora," said I, warming with the subject, "is stony and rugged now,
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

and it rests with us to smooth it. We must fight our way onward. We
must be brave. There are obstacles to be met, and we must meet, and
crush them ! "
   I was going on at a great rate, with a clenched hand, and a most
enthusiastic countenance ; but it was quite unnecessary to proceed. I had
said enough. I had done it again. Oh, she was so frightened! Oh,
where was Julia Mills ! Oh, take her to Julia Mills, and go away,
please ! So that, in short, I was quite distracted, and raved about the
drawing-room.
   I thought I had killed her, this time. I sprinkled water on her face.
I went down on my knees. I plucked at my hair. I denounced myself as
aremorseless brute and a ruthless beast. I implored her forgiveness. I
besought her to look up. I ravaged Miss Mills's work-box for a smelling-
bottle, and in my agony of mind applied an ivory needle-case instead, and
dropped all the needles over Dora. I shook my fists at Jip, who was as frantic
as myself. I did every wild extravagance that could be done, and was a
long way beyond the end of my wits when Miss Mills came into the room.
   " Who has done this ! " exclaimed Miss Mills, succouring her friend.
   I re~lied. " I. Miss Mills ! I have done it ! Behold the destroyer ! "
-or ;or& to 'that effect-and hid my face from the light, in the
sofa cushion.
   At first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel, and that we were verging
on the Desert of Sahara; but she soon found out how matters stood, for
my dear affectionate little Dora, embracing her, began exclaiming that I
was " a poor laborer ;" and then cried for me, and embraced me, and asked
me would I let her give me all her money to keep, and then fell on Miss
Mills's neck, sobbing as if her tender heart were broken.
   Miss Mills must have been born to be a blessing to us. She ascertained
from me in a few words what it was all about, comforted Dora, and
gradually convinced her that I was not a laborer-from my manner of
stating the case I believe Dora concluded that I was a navigator, and went
balancing myself up and down a plank all day with a wheelbarrow-and
so brought us together in peace. When we were quite composed, and
Dora had gone up-stairs to put some rose-water to her eyes, Miss Mills
rang for tea. I n the ensuing interval, I told Miss Mills that she was
evermore my friend, and that my heart must cease to vibrate ere I could
forget her sympathy.
   I then expounded to Miss Mills what I had endeavoured, so very
unsuccessfully, to expound to Dora. Miss Mills replied, on general prin-
ciples, that the Cottage of content was better than the Palace of cold
splendour, and that where love was, all was.
   I said to Miss Mills that this was very true, and who should know it
better than I, who loved Dora with a love that never mortal had expe-
rienced yet. But on Miss Mills observing, with despondency, that it were
well indeed for some hearts if this were so, I explained that I begged
leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the masculine gender.
   I then put it to Miss Mills, to say whether she considered that there
was or was not any practical merit in the suggestion I had been anxious
to make, concerning the accounts, the housekeeping, and the Cookery Book?
   Miss Mills, after some consideration, thus replied :
   " Mr. Copperfield, I will be plain with you.    Mental suffering and trial
384            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

supply, in some natures, the place of years, and I will be as plain with
you as if I were a Lady Abbess. No. The suggestion is not appropriate
to our Dora. Our dearest Dora is a favorite child of nature. She is a
thing of light, and airiness, and joy. I am free to confess that if it could
be done, it might be well, but-"        And Miss Mills shook her head.
    I was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of Miss Mills
to ask her, whether, for Dora's sake, if she had any opportunity of luring
her attention to such preparations for an earnest life, she would avail
herself of i t ? Miss Mills replied in the affirmative so readily, that I
further asked her if she would take charge of the Cookery Book ; and, if
she ever could insinuate it upon Dora's acceptance, without frightening
her, undertake to do me that crowning service. Miss Mills accepted this
trust, too ; but was not sanguine.
    And Dora returned, looking such a lovely little creature, that I really
donbted whether she ought to be troubled with anything so ordinary.
And she loved me so much, and was so captivating, (particularly when she
made Jip stand on his hind legs for toast, and when she pretended to
hold that nose of his against the hot tea-pot for punishment because he
wouldn't), that I felt like a sort of Monster who had got into a Fairy's
bower, when I thought of having frightened her, and made her cry.
    After tea we had the guitar; and Dora sang those same dear old
French songs about the impossibility of ever on any account leaving off
 dancing, La ra la, La ra la, until I felt a much greater Monster than
before.
    We had only one check to our pleasure, and that happened a little
 while before I took my leave, when, Miss Mills chancing to make some
 allusion to to-morrow morning, I unluckily let out that being obliged to
 exert myself now, I got up at five o'clock. Whether Dora had any idea
that I was a Private Watchman, I am unable to say; but it made a great
impression on her, and she neither playednor sang any more.
    I t was still on her mind when I bade her adieu ; and she said to me, in
 her pretty coaxing way-as if I were a doll, I used to think !
    " Now don't get up at five o'clock, you naughty boy. I t ' s so non-
sensical ! "
    '' My love," said I, " I have work to do."
    " But don't do it ! " returned Dora. " Why should you? "
    I t was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face, otherwise
than lightly and playfully, that we must work, to live.
    " Oh ! How ridiculous ! " cried Dora.
    " How shall we live without, Dora? " said I.

    " How ? Any how ! " said Dora.
    She seemed to think she had quite settled the question, and gave me
such a triumphant little kiss, direct from her innocent heart, that I would
 hardly have put her out of conceit with her answer, for a fortune.
    Well ! I loved her, and I went on loving her, most absorbingly, entirely,
 and completely. But going on, too, working pretty hard, and busily
 keeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire, I would sit sometimes
 of a night, opposite my aunt, thinking how I had frightened Dora that
 time, and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case through the
 forest of difficulty, until I used to fancy that my head was turning quite
 grey.

   PREFACE TO THE CHEAP EDITION OF OLIVER TWIST.
                                    CC_

    AT page 267 of this present edition of OLIVER       TWIST,there is a description
 of the "filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary, of the many localities
 that are hidden in London." And the name of this place is JACOB'S         ISLAND.
    Eleven or twelve years have elapsed, since the desdription was first published.
 I was as well convinced then, as I am now, that nothing effectual can be done
 for the elevation of the poor in England, until their dwelling-places are made
 decent and wholesome. I have always been convinced that this Reform must
 precede all other Social Reforms ; that i t must prepare the way for Education,
 even for Religion ; and that, without it, those classes of the people which increase
 the fastest, must become so desperate and be made so miserable, as to bear within
 themselves the certain seeds of ruin to the whole conln~unity.
    The metropolis (of all places under Heaven) being excluded from the pro-
 visions of the Public Health Act, passed last year, a society has been formed
 called the Metropolitan Sanitary Association, with the view of remedying this
 grievous mistake. The association held its first public meeting at Freemason's
Hall, on Wednesday, the sixth of February last : the Bishop of London presiding.
It happened that this very place, JACOB'S    ISLAND,  had lately attracted the atten-
tion of the Board of Health, in consequence of its having been ravaged by cholera;
and that the Bishop of London had in his hands the result of an inquiry under
the Metropolitan Sewers Commission, shewing, by way of proof of the cheapness
of sanitary improvements, an estimate of the probable cost at which the houses
in JACOB'S   ISLAND could be rendered fit for human habitation-which cost was
stated a t about a penny three farthings per week per house. The Bishop referred
to this paper, with the moderation and forbearance which pervaded all his obser-
vations, and did me the honour to mention that I had described JACOB'S        ISLAND.
When I subsequently made a few observations myself, I confessed that soft
impeachment.
   Now the vestry of Marylebone parish, meeting on the following Saturday,
had the honour to be addressed by SIR PETE^ LAURIE; a gentleman of infallible
                                                   2
authority, of great innate modesty, and of a most sweet humanity. This remark-
able alderman, as I am informed by The Observer newspaper, then and there
delivered himself (I quote the passage without any correction) as follows :
  "Having touched upon the point of saving to the poor, he begged to illustrate it by reading for them
the particulars of a survey that nad been made in a locality called ' Jacob's Island '-[a laugh]-where,
according to the surveyor, 1,300 houses were erected on forty acres of ground. The surveyor asserted
and laid down that each house could he supplied with a constant supply of pure water-secondly, t h a t
each house could he supplied with a sink-thirdly, a water-closet-fourthly, a drain-fifthly, a foundation
drain-and, sixthly, the acconlmodation of a dust bin [laughter], and all at the average rate of 13s. 4d.
per week [oh, oh, and laughter].
  ";Mr. G. BIRD: Can Sir Peter Laurie tellthe vestry where 'Jacob's Island ' is [laughter].
  " Sir P. Launra: : That was just what he was about to teli them.      The Bishop of London, poor soul,
in his simplicity, thought there redly was such a place, which he had been describing so minutely,
whereasit turwd out that it ONLY edsted in a work offiction, written b y b!!. Charles Dickwzs ten
w a v s ago [roars of laughter]. The fact zoas adnzitted b y Mr. Charles Dickens himself at the meeting,
and he (Sir P. Laurie) had extracted his words from the same paper, the Morrhing Herald. Mr. Dickens
said 'Now the first of these cPasses proceeded generally on the supposition that the compulsory improve-
ment of these dwellings, when exceedingly defective, would be very expensive. But that was a great
mistake, for nothiilg wascheaper than good sanitary improvements, as they ]mew in this case of 'Jacob's
Island' [laughter], which he had described in a work of fiction some ten or eleven years ago.'"
  When I came to read this, I was so much struck by the honesty, by the truth,
and by the wisdom of this logic, as well as by the fact of the sagacious vestry,
including members of parliament, magistrates, officers, chemists, and I know
not who else, listening to i t meekly (as became them), that I resolved to record
the fact here, as a certain means of making it known to, and causing it to be
reverenced by, many thousands of people. Reflecting upon this logic, and its
universal application; remembering that when FIELDING     described Newgate, the
prison immediately ceased to exist ; that when SMIIOLLETT  took Roderick Random
to Bath, that city instantly sank into the earth; that when SOOTTexercised
his genius on Whitefriars, it incontinently glided into the Thames; that an
ancient place called Windsor was entirely destroyed in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth by two Merry Wives of that town, acting under the direction of a
person of the name of SHAKESPEARE;         and that MR. POPE,after having at a
great expense completed his grotto at Twickenham, incautiously reduced it to
ashes by writing a poem upon it ;-I say, when I came to consider these things,
I was inclined to make this preface the vehicle of my humble tribute of admi-
ration to SIR PETERLAURIE.But, I am restrained by a very painful consideration
-by no less a consideration than the impossibility of his existence. For SIR
PETERLAURIEhaving been himself described in a book (as I understand he was,
one Christmas time, for his conduct on the seat of Justice), it is but too clear
that there C A N be no such man !
   Otherwise, I should have been quite sure of his concurrence in the following
passage, written thirty years ago by my late lamented friend the Reverend SYDNEY
SMITH,that great master of wit, and terror of noodles ; but singularly applicable
to the present occasion.
  "We have been thus particular in stating the case, that we may make a n answer to those profligate
persoas u,ho are always ready to fling a n air of ridicule upon the labours of humanity, because they a10
desirous that what they have'not the virtue to do themselves, should appear to be foolish and romantic
when done by others. A still higher degree of depravity than this, is to want every sort of ~umpassion
foi h u ~ u a umisery, when i t is accompanied by filth, poverty, and ignorance. To regulate humanity by
the income tax, and to deem the bodily wretchedness and the dirty tears of the poor, a fit subject for
pleasantry and contempt. We should have been loth to believe that such deep-seated and disgusting
immorality existed in these days ; hut the notice of it is forced upon us."

of a very large circulation will cover the outlay.
  T h e first Two Volumes will be entitled
SAILINGS OVER THE GLOBE; OR, THE PROGRESS OF MARITIME
     DISCOVERY : THE EAST, WEST, NORTH, AND SOUTH.
  T h e first Volume, which will appear in May, will contain:-The Rise
and Progress of Navigation-Early Discoveries of the Portuguese-Voyages
of Vasco de Gama and Mendez Pinto-the Four Voyages of Columbus-
Cortez and the Discovery of Mexico-Pizarro and the Conquest of Peru.
    THE LITERATURE OF WORKING MEN.

                              Just Published, the First

               SUPPLEMENTARY NUMBER

      THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND,
                            TO BE CONTINUED MONTHLY,
             Uniform in size and price with the Weekly Numbers.
   These Supplementary Numbers will be devoted entirely to communications from
Working Men. An opportunity will thus be afforded to the working classes for
furnishing hints and suggestions as to the improvement of their own order, whether
physically, socially, or morally. I n addition, however, to correspondence of this kind,
which will always receive respectful attention, it is the intention of John Cassell, as an
encouragement to literary exertion, t o award prizes, in the shape of valuable books, to
those whose compositions may be considered worthy of insertion. No such article ought
to exceed about four pages in length. To articles of that extent, approved by impartial
judges, some volume or volumes, t o the value of one guinea, selected from a list by the
successful writers, will be forwarded, post free; for shorter articles, volumes varying in
value from five shillings to fifteen shillings will be sent. The numerous communications
which have been received demonstrate, not only that the pages of THE WORKINGMAN'S
FRIENDare occupied to the satisfaction of the writers, but also the possession of talent
among the working classes of no ordinary character. Independently of any inducement
of the kind now offered, the proposed Supplementary Numbers could be welt filled hy the
spontaneous effusions of men who have not only hard hands, but hard-thinking heads-
men who are intensely anxious for the elevation of their fellows. At the same time it is
believed that the presentation of valuable and instructive works will not only be a
suitable acknowledgment to industry and talent, but beneficial in the influence it will
exert in the families and circles of the writers. The trade and initials of each contributor
will be appended. It is to be well understood that the writers must belong strictly to
the operative class. The subjects may embrace morality, social order and comfort,
history, biography, art, science, general literature, and the principles and claims of any
movement tending to promote the improvement and welfare of the people.
  All communications t o b e addressed to J O H N CASSELL, 335, Strand, London. Full
address in each case.

                           THE    FOLLOWING    ARE SOME O F THE
              OPINIONS OF THE PUBLIC PRESS:
                                  (From the Daily News.)
  A cheap, useful, and amusing miscellany.
                                       (From the Atlas.)
  A cheap weekly serial, devoted to the improvement and amusement of the working
classes. W e see little that is objectionable in this periodical, and very much to corn.
mend. I t is pleasantly and thoughtfully written. I t is likely, we think, to do good
service in a good cause.
                                   (From the London Patriot.)
    Several articles in the first two numbers (all that are as yet issued) are of a first-rate
 character, and would do no dishonour to our best magazines ; while they are skilfully
adapted, in tone and treatment, to the class of readers contemplated. Most of the writers
are anonymous; but Mary Howitt, who contributes some characteristic stories, is not,
we venture to say, the only author of celebrity engaged on this new miscellany.
                             (From the Nonconformist, January 9.)
    If the enterprise is sustained with as much spirit as it has been commenced, its success
cannot be doubted. This first number forms an excellent pennyworth of i~latructionand
entertainment, free from all that is injurious or debasing.
                         (From the Manchester Examiner and Times.)
    A new weekly periodical of excellent quality and amazing bulk for a penny. The
well-known energies and extensive appliances of its publisher are guaranteed for con-
tinued excellence and success. Among the many excellent journals useful to the
working man, this must stand in the first class. I t takes that place at its first step ; and
if instructive to those to whom i t is specially addressed, it cannot fail to be so to those
who occupy a higher social position.
                         (From the Dumfries and Galloway Standard.)
    THE WORKINGMAX'S FRIENDAND FAMILYINSTRUCTOR.                        Such is the title of
Mr. Cassell's new magazine, and it does him infinite credit. The topics discussed are
various, all ably and popularly treated. I t promises to be one of the best, and we are
inclined to rank it as the cheapest in the whole range of our serial literature.
                           (From the Scottish Reformer's Gazette.)
    W e think we may express our unqualified approbation of the sound and healthful
 spirit which animates THE WORKING         MAN'SFRIEND. It contains an amazing quantity
 of interesting, instructive, and well-selected matter, and deserves to be universally read
by that extensive class for whom it is especially intended.
                               (From the Newcastle Guardian.)
     Such a variety of clever and instructive writing has never been previously offered to
the public. For cheapness and real excellence there is nothing to equal this periodical,
 even in these days of amplified publishing.
                                 (From the Glasgow Examiner.)
    The working classes will not be their own friends if they do not largely patronise this
very suitable publication. The publisher is doing his duty, and we shall be disappointed
 if the working classes neglect theirs.
                             - (From the Leicester Mercury.)
    THE WORKINGMAN'S FRIENDis really one of the cheapest           .  -
                                                                       periodicals of the day
and the papers are generally written with great care and force.
                                  (From the Edinburgh Nczus;)
    This is a clever and business-like production. Its aim is of a more ~racticalcharacter
than the majority of the cheap publications. I t seems to strive mainly at imparting
useful information in matters of political, social, and domestic economy ; and if we may
be entitled to speak from the specimen before us, it may be safely averred that the pro-
jector has been completely successful.
                               (From the Nottingham Review.)
   The first monthly part has made its appearance, and fully bears out its title as a
"friend " and "instructor," and is moreover extremely talented and interesting.
                                 (From the Plymouth Journal.)
   W e have seen a great deal of cheap literature of late, and its appearance has excited
our astonishment; but we have seen nothing equal to the pennyworth that is now before
us. I t is not only literary, but has a very large spice of that political information, which
will render it essentially welcome to working men, most of whom hold decided views,
and are friendly to those works that give utterance to them.
                         (From the North and South Shields Gazette.)
   Without hyperbole or humbug, this is the rarest Working Man's Friend we have met
with for many a day. W e say to all our readers-and especially to such as have families
-go and get a copy of it the first opportunity, and then if most of you do not become
regular subscribers, for your own sake, or for that of the young folks, we shall think our
taste is defective.
                                    (From the Norfolk News.)
   W e hail with pleasure every effort to enlighten the minds of the people, relative to their
rights and their duties, as members of social and political society ; but we give more
than ordinary welcome to this little serial, inasmuch as it is more adapted to the require-
ments of the day than any other of the class which we have yet seen. I t is cheap,
interesting, and instructive. The opening addresses alone are worth more than ten
times the cost of the whole. To every working man, ay, and to every man, we say:
" Take it regularly, read it regularly with an unprejudiced mind, and you will, if the
first and second numbers be a guarantee of its future career, be as regularly gratified with
its matter, and the spirit in which it is conducted."
                                    (From the Bath Journal.)
   Thirty-two pages of very close print, most of it original literature, of a very superior
sort, and the remainder selected with very great care and excellent judgment, all for one
penny. Nothing but an extraordinarily large circulation can repay the enterprising
publisher and proprietor. Here is food wholesome and strengthening, for a man's mind,
supplied at a cost trifling enough to be wonderful, and compared with which the price of
bread of life is monstrously high.
                                 (From the Darlington Times.)
   This is the first number of one of the cheapest periodicals which this age of cheap
literature has produced, and, moreover, one of the best. Mr. Cassell has l o n ~     appeared
in the van of many of the progressive movements of the day ; but we auestionyf &her of
the great movemekts in whi& he has been engaged is more calculaied to advance the
interests of the working classes than the publication of this little weekly. We have for a
mere nominal price thirty-two closely-printed octavo pages of sterling matter, embracing
the greatest possible variety of subjects, all of which blend interest and entertainment
with solid instruction and sound information.
                                  (From the Bristol Mercury.)
   W e can safely say that in the variety and literary merits of its contents, and its extreme
cheapness, it is one of the most remarkable publications of the class which have come
under our notice. If such a publication as thisdo not successfully appeal to the working
man, nothing of the sort can do so.
                                  (From the Liverpool AEion.)
   The cheapness of this publication, and the high morality inculcated throughout its
articles, cannot fail to elevate the minds of its readers.
                                (From the Liverpool Mercury.)
   This is a surprising pamphlet. Every man and woman ought to order one copy, at all
events, from a bookseller, and take it in as long as they find it worth the money to them
and their firesides. I t will be found worth much more, and will save money beside.
                               (From the Edinbur,gh Register.)
   The Editor thoroughly understands his business, and has produced a periodical in every
respect adapted for the fireside of the working man. Its lightness and liveliness are
excellent characteristics, and will be great recommendations to men coming home of an
evening from a hard day's work.
                                    (From the West Briton.)
   A new periodical of extreme cheapness, qublished weekly and in monthly parts, and
well calculated, by the amount of substantial information it contains, to diffuse knowledge
among the working classes.

INDUSTRY O F ALL N A T I O N S ;
                     TO BE HELD I N LONDON I N 1851.

HER MAJESTY'SCOMMISSIONERS
                        for the Promotion of the EXHIBITIONOF                  THE WORKSOF
INDUSTRY OF   ALL   NATIONS,to be holden in 1851, having had the various subjects of their
inquiry under their anxious consideration, are now prepared to state, for the information of
the public, the progress they have made in determining on the different points referred
to in their announcement of the 11th January last.
    The decisions they have been able to come to have been necessarily limited by their
present want of knowledge as to what pecuniary means will be placed at their disposal ; and
the shortness of the time, during which this vast organization will have to be completed
renders i t imperative upon the Commissioners to make an earnest appeal to the country, to
enable them as soon as possible, to know upon what amount of subscriptions they may
ultimately rely.
    The scale upon which this important undertaking will be conducted, must depend entirely
on the amount of pecuniary support which it shall receive from the public. Her Majesty's
Commissioners appeal with confidence to all classes of the community, to enable them to
make such liberal arrangements as will ensure the success of this undertaking, in a manner
worthy of the character and position of this country, and of the invitation which has been
given to the other nations of the world to compete with us in a spirit of generous and
friendly emulation.
    The Commissioners have fixed upon the 1st day of Yay, 1851, for opening the Exhibition.
    The Commissioners will be prepared to receive and take care of, at the expense of the
Commissioners, all articles which may be sent to them, and delivered at a place to be named
by the Commissioners in London, on or after the 1st of January, 1851, and will continue so
to receive goods until the 1st of March inclusive; after which day no further -     goods will
be receive&
    Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to grant a site for this purpose on the south side
of Hyde Park, lying between the Kensington Drive and the Ride commonly called
Rotten Row.
    From the approximate estimate which the Commissioners have been able to make, they
believe that the Building ought to cover a space of from 16 to 20 Acres, or about One million
of Square Feet.
    The Productions of all Nations will be exhibited together, under one General Classification.
    The Articles exhibited will be divided into Four Sections, as before announced, and a
Classified List, together with general instructions affecting each Department, are appended.
Her Majesty's Commissioners wish to express their grateful sense of the valuable assistance
which they have received in drawing up that List from the Members of the Sectional
Committees.
    The Building will be provided to the Exhibitors free from rent, and will be fire-proof.
    Exhibitors will be required to deliver their objects, at their own charge and risk, at the
Building in the Park; but no charges of any kind will be made whilst they remain there.
    Colonial and Foreign productions will be admitted without paying duty, for the purposes
of exhibition, but not for internal consumption. Her Majesty's Commissioners of Customs
will consider all such Articles as Bonded Goods; and Her Majesty's Commissioners for the
Exhibition of 1851 will make suitable arrangements for their reception.
    Her Majesty's Commissioners are desirous that there should be complete local organiza-
tion, and that the Local Committees, wherever formed, should themselves collect the
Subscriptions within their own districts. The Local Committees should advertise dl
Subscriptions they receive, and defray all local expenses, paying such commission for
collection as they may think necessary.
    Her Majesty's Commissioners think that the same complete system of organization should
be extended as much as possible to the British Colonies.
    Subscriptions should be paid to the Treasurers of Local Committees, and by them trans-
ferred to the General Fund at the Bank of Eneland. in the names of A. K. Barclav. Esa..
W. Cotton, Esq., Sir J. W. Lubbock, Bart., S. M. Peto, Esq., M.P., and Baron ~(ooheeli e
Rothschild. M.P.
    Her Mijesty's Commissioners having undertaken the absolute control over the expenditure
of all money that may come into the hands of their Treasurers, have made arrangements for
auditing accounts, and ensuring the strictest economy.
    Her Majesty's Commissioners hope that the funds to be placed at their disposal by
voluntary contributions may be such as to enable them so to regulate the amount to be paid
for entrance, that all classes may be enabled to visit the Exhibition.
    Should any surplus remain, after giving every facility to the Exhibitors and increasing
the privileges of the Public as spectators, Her Majesty's Commissioners intend to apply the
same to purposes strictly in connexion with the ends of the Exhibition, or for the establish-
ment of similar Exhibitions for the future.
    However large the Building may be,-the quantity of articles sent for Exhibition may
exceed any amount of space that can be provided ;-Her Majesty's Commissioners conse-
quently reserve to themselves ample powers of rejection and selection. Upon the amount
subscribed must necessarily depend the space which they may be enabled to allot; but under
all circumstances they will have to exercise a certain discretion.
    Her Majesty's Commissioners also desire that the Local Committees will, as early as
possible, procure an inventory or general specification of articles proposed to be exhibited
from their Districts, and of the space which will be required for their exhibition, in order to
enable the Con~missionersto determine as soon as possible the extent and the -proportions
                                                                                    -        of
the building.
    Her Majesty's Commissioners are in communication with the Foreign Office, concerning
the means of informing Foreign Governments of the arrangements making for the Exhibition.
    Her Majesty's Commissioners are considering the principles upon which the Prize Fund
of 820,000, shall be appropriated, and the best mode of adjudication.
    If there be any points upon which Local Committees may require information, and will
address themselves to the Secretaries of the Commission, Her Majesty's Commissioners will
be happy to afford i t to them, so far as it may be in their power.

                                     Division (A).--Mineral Kingdom.
     I t is desirable that the Raw Materials should be shown in connection with the produce of the MineraI
Kingdom, so as to form a history and explanation of the processes employed to fit them for the useful and
ornamental purposes of life. The Exhibition would thus comprehend (1.) Illustrations of the various modes of
extracting and preparing the Raw Materials for Produce; ( 2 . ) Illustrations of methods of reducing, working, or
combining Raw Materials, so as to obtain Products which may afterwards receive applications to the useful or
ornamental purposes of life.
     T h e Specimens fitted for exhibition should include (1.)only those remarkable for their excellence, for nove2ly
in their occurrence or application, or economy of their extraction or preparation; or (2.) those remarkable as
illustrations of some further processes of Manufacture.
                                  Division (B.)-Vegetable             Kingdom.
      The objects which the Commission i s most desirous of receiving, among the products of the Vegetable
 Kingdom, are such as from their utility, novelty, or practical interest may appear especially deserving public
 attention. Peculiarly fine samples of substances in common use; authenticated samples of substances having
 similar properties, but derived from digerent sources-such as Arrowroot, Sago, &c. Dyeing Materials, accom-
 panied by specimens exhibiting the effect of such Materials. Fancy Wood, both in the polishell, rough, and
 manufactured state. All sorts of materials, which are applicable to the manalkcturc of linen, corduge, wiclier
 work, paper, and the like.
      Nothing, however, appears snitable to this Exhibition except such results of human industry as are capable
 of being preserved without injury through several months.
                                      Division (C.)-Animal Kingdom.
     As Illustrations in this Division, the various Processes of Preparation may be exhibited i n connection with
 the Raw Materials : and i n some cases a Finished Article may be introduced as the termination of a series of
 objects in preparatory stages.
      Nothing, however, appears suitable to this Exhibition except snch results of human industry as are capable
 of being preserved without injury through several months.

                                      Section 2.-Machinery.
                             Division (A.)-Machines              for Direct Use.
      Machines will be exhibited in motion, whenever i t may be desirable to do so, and it n;ay be found prac-
 ticable to provide the necessary arrangements for that purpose.
                              Division (B.)-Manufacturing                Machines.
      Although in arranging this class for exhibition, it will generally be found advisable to separate the Products
 from the Producing Mechanism; yet the latter should always he accompanied with sufficient specimens of the
 Raw Material, in its several stages of manufacture, and of the finished product, to make the operation of the
 Machinery intelligible.
      The complete series of tools and machinery that belongs to the manufacture of any object of common use,
 such as a watch, a button, or a needle, accompa~iied by specimens of the object and its parts, in their various
 stages of progress, is so instructive and interesting, that it is very desirable to obtain several such series for the
 proposed Exhibition.
                                      Section 3.-Manufactures.
      Manufactures to be exhibited in this Section must be in their Finished state, as fit for use.
      Designs for Manufactures wiil be exhibited in the Section of Manufactures.
      All Articles to be admitted in this Section must exhibit one or more of the following qualifications :-

                                                   __t__


 How that old picture brings before the eye                Would ne'er be set aside for such as those.
 The Dress peculiar t o the days gone by!                  You see by that old picture, hanging there,
 Look a t the figures! such outlandish styles              What vast improvements have been brought to bear.
 Seem fasbion'd only t o provoke to smiles.                Look at that coat! how wretchedly it fits.
 How very diff'rent were the dresses worn                  And see the vest! how awkwardly it sits.
 When that old-fashion'd picture first was drawn.          Mine (which I bought of MOSES,by the bye),
 See! there's a curious coat-and there's a bat !           In style and fit, offend not thus the eye.
 And there's a bonnie waistcoat ! look a t that!           MOSESand SONfor me ! no Tailors please
 What would be thought, if, in the present day,            In any single sense, compared with these.
 A person were t o dress in such a way?                    Their Boots and Hats, as well as their attire,
 Folks in the public streets would stand tomock            Are positively all that we require.
 And make th' eccentric man a Laughing stock.              Better I never saw, nor better want,
 Though all the fashion, fifty years ago,                  And better can't be had, depend upon't.
 They would not now pass muster-0, dear, no!               MOSESand SONfor me ! no tradesmen please,
 Mosrcs and SON'Ssuperior style in clothes                 In any single point, compared with these.

THE HOUSEHOLD NARRAT                 OF


                   CURRENT EVENTS.
                              CONDUCTED BY


            CHARLES DICKENS.
                                   BEING A


Monthly Supplement to " Household Words."
       E take this opportunity of announcing a design, closely associated
        with our Household Words, which we have now matured, and which
 we hope will be acceptable to our readers.
    We purpose publishing, at the end of each month as a Supplementary
 Number to the monthly part of Household Words, a comprehensive Abstract
 or History of all the occurrences of that month, native and foreign, under
 the title of THE HOUSEHOLD     NARRATIVE   OF CURRENT     EVENTS.
    The size and price of each of these numbers will be the same as the size
 and price of a single number of '<HOUSEHOLD WORDS."                   Twelve
  umbers will necessarily be published in the course of the year-one for each
 month-and on the completion of the Annual Volume, a copious Index will
 appear, and a title-page for the volume ; which will then be called THE
 HOUSEHOLD    NARRATIVE   of such a year. I t will form a complete Chronicle
 of all that year's events, carefully compiled, thoroughly digested, and sys-
 tematically arranged for easy reference ; presenting a vast mass of infor-
 mation that must be interesting to all, at n price that will render it
 accessible to the humblest purchasers of books, and at which only our
 existing machinery in connexion with our Weekly TvIiscellany would enable
us to produce it.
   The first number of THE HOUSEHOLD          NARRATIVE     will appear as a
Supplement to the first monthly part of " Household Words," published a t
the end of the present month of APRIL, AS the Volume for 1850 would be
incomplete (in consequence of our not having commenced this publication
at the beginning of a year) without a backward reference to the three
months of JANUARY,       FEBRUARY,    and MARCH,a similar number of THE
HOUSEHOLD      NARRATIVE   for each of those months will be published before
the year is out.
   I t is scarcely necessary to explain that it is not proposed to render the
purchase of THE HOUSEHOLD         NARRATIVE  compulsory on the purchasers of
Household Words ; and that the Supplementary Number, though always
published a t the same time as our Monthly Part, will therefore be detached
from it, and published separately.
   Nor is it necessary for us, we believe, to expatiate on our leading reasons
for adding this new undertaking to our present enterprise. The intimate
connexion between the facts and realities of the time, and the means by
which we aim, in HOUSEHOLD WORDS," to soften what is hard in
them, to exalt what is held in little consideration, and to show the latent
hope there is in what may seem unprornising, needs not to be pointed out.
All that we sought to express in our Preliminary Word, in reference to
this work, applies, we think, to its proposed companion. As another
humble means of enabling those who accept us for their friend, to bear
the world's rough-cast events to the anvil of courageous duty, and there
beat them into shape, we enter on the project, and confide in its success.

                         CHAPTER XXXVIII.
                    A DISSOLUTION O F PARTNERSHIP.

   I DID not allow my resolution, with respect to the Parliamentary
 Debates, to cool. It was one of the irons I began to heat immediately,
 and one of the irons I kept hot, and hammered at, with a perseverance I
 may honestly admire. I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and
mystery of stenography (which cost me ten and sixpence) ; and plunged
into a sea of perplexity that brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines
of distraction. The changes that were rung upon dots, which in such a
position meant such a thing, and in such another position something else,
entirely different ; the wonderful vagaries that were played by circles ; the
unaccountable consequences that resulted from marks like flies' legs ; the
tremendous effects of a curve in a wrong place; not only troubled my
waking hours, but reappeared before me in my sleep. When I had
groped my way, blindly, through these difficulties, and had mastered the
alphabet, which was an Egyptian Temple in itself, there then appeared a
procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters ; the most despotic
characters I have ever known ; who insisted, for instance, that a thing like
the beginning of a cobweb, meant expectation, and that a pen and ink
sky-rocket stood for disadvantageous. When I had fixed these wretches in
my mind, I found that they had driven everything else out of i t ; then,
beginning again, I forgot them ; while I was picking them up, I dropped
the other fragments of the system ; in short, it was almost heart-breaking.
   I t might have been quite heart-breaking, but for Dora, who was the
stay and anchor of my tempest-driven bark. Every scratch in the scheme
was a gnarled oak in the forest of difficulty, and I went on cutting them
 down, one after another, with such vigour, that in three or four months
I was in a condition to make an experiment on one of our crack speakers
in the Commons. Shall I ever forget how the crack speaker walked off
from me before I began, and left my imbecile pencil staggering about the
paper as if it were in a fit !
   This would not do, it was quite clear. I was flying too high, and
should never get on, so. I resorted to Traddles for advice; who snggested
that he should dictate speeches to me, at a pace, and with occasional
stoppages, adapted to my weakness. Very grateful for this friendly aid,
I accepted the proposal ; and night after night, almost every night, for a
long time, we had a sort of private Parliament in Buckingham Street,
after I came home from the Doctor's.
   I should like to see such a Parliament anywhere else ! My aunt and
Mr. Dick represented the Government or the Opposition (as the case might
be), and Traddles, with the assistance of Enfield's Speaker or a volume of
parliamentary orations, thundered astonishing invectives against them.
Standing by the table, with his finger in the page to keep the place,
                                                              C C
386           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

and his right arm flourishing above his head, Traddles, as Mr. Pitt,
Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord Castlereagh, Viscount Sidmouth,
or Mr. Canning, would work himself into the most violent heats, and
deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy and corruption
of my aunt and Mr. Dick; while I used to sit, at a little distance, with
my note-book on my knee, fagging after him with all my might and main.
The inconsistency and recklessness of Traddles were not to be exceeded
by any real politician. He was for any description of policy, in the com-
pass of a week; and nailed all sorts of colours to every denomination of
mast. My aunt, looking very like an immoveable Chancellor of the
Exchequer, would occasionally throw in an interruption or two, as "Hear !"
or "No ! " or " Oh ! " when the text seemed to require it : which was
always a signal to Mr. Dick (a perfect country gentleman) to follow lustily
with the same cry. But Mr. Dick got taxed with such things in the
course of his Parliamentary career, and was made responsible for such
awful consequences, that he became uncomfortable in his mind some-
times. I believe he actually began to be afraid he really had been doing
something, tending to the annihilation of the British constitution, and the
ruin of the country.
   Often and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to
midnight, and the candles were burning down. The result of so much
good practice was, that by-and-by I began to keep pace with Traddles
pretty well, and should have been quite triumphant if I had had the least
idea what my notes were about. But, as to reading them after I had got
them, I might as well have copied the Chinese inscriptions on an immense
collection of tea-chests, or the golden characters on all the great red and
green bottles in the chemists' shops !
   There was nothing for it, hut to turn back and begin all over again.
It was very hard, but I turned back, though with a heavy heart, and began
laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a
snail's pace; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way, on
all sides, and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive
characters by sight wherever I met them. I was always punctual at the
office; at the Doctor's too : and I really did work, as the common expres-
sion is, like a cart-horse.
   One day, when I went to the Commons as usual, I found Mr. Spenlow
in the doorway looking extremely grave, and talking to himself. As he
was in the habit of complaining of pains in his head-he had naturally a
short throat, and I do seriously believe he overstarched himself-I      was
at first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction;
but he soon relieved my uneasiness.
   Instead of returning my " Good morning" with his usual affability, he
looked at me in a distant, ceremonious manner, and coldly requested me
to accompany him to a certain coffee-house, which, in those days, had a
door opening into the Commons, just within the little archway in St. Paul's
churchyard. I complied, in a very uncomfortable state, and with a warm
shooting all over me, as if my apprehensions were breaking out into buds.
When I allowed him to go on a little before, on account of the narrowness
of the way, I observed that he carried his head with a lofty air that was
particularly unpromising; and my mind misgave me that he had found
out about my darling Dora.

    If I had not guessed this, on the way to the coffee-house, I could hardly
 have failed to know what was the matter when I followed him into an
 up-stairs room, and found Miss Murdstone there, supported by a back-
 ground of sideboard, on which were several inverted tumblers sustaining
 lemons, and two of those extraordinary boxes, all corners and flutings, for
 sticking knives and forks in, which, happily for mankind, are now obsolete.
    Miss Murdstone gave me her chilly finger-nails, and sat severely rigid.
 Mr. Spenlow shut the door, motioned me to a chair, and stood on the
hearth-rug in front of the fireplace.
     "Have the goodness to show Mr. Copperfield," said Mr. Spenlow,
 "what you have in your reticule, Miss Murdstone."
    I believe it was the old identical steel-clasped reticule of my childhood,
that shut up like a bite. Compressing her lips, in sympathy with the
snap, Miss Murdstone opened it-opening her mouth a little at the same
time-and produced my last letter to Dora, teeming with expressions of
devoted affection.
    "I believe that is your writing, Mr. Copperfield?" said Mr. Spenlow.
    I was very hot, and the voice I heard was very unlike mine, when I
 said, " I t is sir ! "
     " If I am not mistaken," said Mr. Spenlow, as Miss Murdstone brought
a parcel of Ietters out of her reticule, tied round with the dearest bit of
blue ribbon, " those are also from your pen, Mr. Copperfield? "
    I took them from her with a most desolate sensation ; and, glancing at
such phrases at the top, as "My ever dearest and own Dora," " My best
beloved angel," " My blessed one for ever," and the like, blushed deeply,
and inclined my head.
    " No, thank you ! " said Mr. Spenlow coldly, as I mechanically offered
them back to him. " I will not deprive you of them. Miss Murdstone,
be so good as to proceed ! "
    That gentle creature, after a moment's thoughtful survey of the
carpet, delivered herself with much dry unction as follows.
    " I must confess to having entertained my suspicions of Miss Spenlow,

in reference to David Copperfield, for some time. I observed Miss
Spenlow and David Copperfield, when they first met ; and the impression
made upon me then was not agreeable. The depravity of the human
heart is such-"
    " You will oblige me, ma'am," interrupted Mr. Spenlow, " by confining
yourself to facts."
    Miss Murdstone cast down her eyes, shook her head as if protesting
against this unseemly interruption, and with frowning dignity resumed :
    c c Since I am to confine myself to facts, I will state them as dryly as
I can. Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of pro-
ceeding. I have already said, sir, that I have had my suspicions of Miss
Spenlow, in reference to David Copperfield, for some time. I have
frequently endeavoured to find decisive coroboration of those suspicions,
but without effect. I have therefore forborne to mention them to Miss
Spenlow's father;" looking severely at him; " knowing how little
d~spositionthere usually is in such cases, to acknowledge the conscientious
discharge of duty."
   Mr. Spenlow seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of Miss
                                                            c c 2

Murdstone's manner, and deprecated her severity with a conciliatory little
wave of his hand.
    " On my return to Norwood, after the period of absence occasioned by
my brother's marriage," pursued Miss Murdstone in a disdainful voice,
" and on the return of Miss Spenlow from her visit to her friend Miss

Mills, I imagined that the manner of Miss Spenlow gave me greater
occasion for suspicion than before. Therefore I watched Miss Spenlow
closely."
    Dear, tender little Dora, so unconscious of this Dragon's eye !
    " Still," resumed Miss Murdstone, " I found no proof until last
night. I t appeared to me that Miss Spenlow received too many letters
from her friend Miss Mills ; but Miss Mills being her friend with her
father's full concurrence," another telling blow at Mr. Spenlow, " it was
not for me to interfere. If I may not be permitted to allude to the
natural depravity of the human heart, at least I may-I must-be per-
mitted, so far to refer to misplaced confidence."
    Mr. Spenlow apologetically murmured his assent.
    " Last evening after tea," pursued Miss Murdstone, ' I I observed the
little dog starting, rolling, and growling about the drawing-room, worrying
something. I said to Miss Spenlow, 'Dora, what is that the dog has in
his mouth? I t ' s paper.' Miss Spenlow immediately put her hand to her
frock, gave a sudden cry, and ran to the dog. I interposed, and said
' Dora my love, you must permit me.' "
    Oh Jip, miserable Spaniel, this wretchedness, then, was your work !
    " Miss Spenlow endeavoured" said Miss Murdstone " to bribe me
with kisses, work-boxes, and small articles of jewellery-that, of course,
I pass over. The little dog retreated under the sofa on my approaching
him, and was with great difficulty dislodged by the fire-irons. Even when
 dislodged, he still kept the letter in his mouth; and on my endeavouring
 to takeit from him, at the imminent riskof being bitten, he kept it between
 his teeth so pertinaciously as to suffer himself to be held suspended
 in the air by means of the document. At length I obtained possession
 of it. After perusing it, I taxed Miss Spenlow with having many such
letters in her possession; and ultimately obtained from her, the packet
which is now in David Copperfield's hand."
    Here she ceased; and snapping her reticule again, and shutting her
mouth, looked as if she might be broken, but could never be bent.
    "You have heard Miss Murdstone," said Mr. Spenlow, turning to me.
"I beg to ask, Mr. Copperfield, if you have anything to say in reply? "
    The picture I had before me, of the beautiful little treasure of my heart,
sobbing and crying all night-of            her being alone, frightened, and
wretched, then-of her having so piteously begged and prayed that stony-
hearted woman to forgive her-of her having vainly offered her those
kisses, work-boxes, and trinkets-of her being in such grievous distress,
and all for me-very much impaired the little dignity I had been able to
muster. I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a minute or so, though
I did my best to disguise it.
    "There is nothing I can say, sir," I returned, "except that all the
blame is mine. Dora-"
    " Miss Spenlow, if you please," said her father, majestically.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          389
   " - was induced and persuaded by me," I went on, swallowing that
colder designation, " t o consent to this concealment, and I bitterly
regret it."
    "You are very much to blame, sir," said Mr. Spenlow, walking to
and fro upon the hearth-rug, and emphasizing what he said with his whole
body instead of his head, on account of the stiffness of his cravat and
spine. "You have done a stealthy and unbecoming action, Mr.
Copperfield. When I take a gentleman to my house, no matter whether
he is nineteen, twenty-nine, or ninety, I take him there in a spirit of
confidence. If he abuses my confidence, he commits a dishonourable
action, Mr. Copperfield."
   "1 feel it, sir, I assure you," I returned. " But I never thought so,
before. Sincerely, honestly, indeed, Mr. Spenlow, I never thought so,
before. I love Miss Spenlow to that extent-"
   " Pooh ! nonsense ! " said Mr. Spenlow, reddening. '' Pray don't tell
me to my face that you love my daughter, Mr. Copperfield ! "
   "Could I defend my conduct if I did not, sir?" I returned, with all
humility.
    " Can you defend your conduct if you do, sir?" said Mr. Spenlow,

stopping short upon the hearth-rug. " Have you considered your years,
and my daughter's years, Mr. Copperfield ? Have you considered what it
is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter
and myself? Have you considered my daughter's station in life, the
projects I may contemplate for her advancement, the testamentary inten-
tions I may have with reference to her? Have you considered anything,
Mr. Copperfield ? "
   "Very little, sir, I am afraid ;" I answered, speaking to him as respect-
fully and sorrowfully as I felt ; " but pray believe me, I have considered
my own worldly position. When I explained it to you, we were already
engaged-"
   " I BEG," said Mr. Spenlow, more like Punch than I had ever seen
him, as he energetically struck one hand upon the other-I could not
help noticing that even in my despair; "that you will NOT talk to me of
engagements, Mr. Copperfield !"
   The otherwise immoveable Miss Murdstone laughed contemptuously in
one short syllable.
   "When I explained my altered position to you, sir," I began again,
substituting a new form of expression for what was so unpalatable to him,
"this concealment, into which I am so unhappy as to have led Miss
Spenlow, had begun. Since I have been in that altered position, I have
strained every nerve, I have exerted every energy, to improve it. I am
sure I shall improve it in time. Will you grant me time-any length
of time ? We are both so young, sir,-"
   "You are right," interrupted Mr. Spenlow, nodding his head a great
many times, and frowning very much, " you are both very young. I t ' s
all nonsense. Let there be an end of the nonsense. Take away those
letters, and throw them in the fire. Give me Miss Spenlow's letters to
throw in the fire; and although our future intercourse must, you are
aware, be restricted to the Commons here, we will agree to make no further
mention of the past. Come, Mr. Copperfield, you don't want sense ; and
this is the sensible course."
390           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    No. I couldn't think of agreeing to it. I was very sorry, but there
 was a higher consideration than sense. Love was above all earthly con-
 siderations, and I loved Dora to idolatry, and Dora loved me. I didn't
 exactly say so; I softened it down as much as I could ; but I implied it,
and I was resolute upon it. I don't think I made myself very ridiculous,
but I know I was resolute.
    r r Very well, Mr. Copperfield," said Mr. Spenlow, " I must try my
influence with my daughter."
    Miss Murdstone, by an expressive sound, a long drawn respiration,
which was neither a sigh nor a moan, but was like both, gave it as her
opinion that he should have done this at first.
    "I must try," said Mr. Spenlow, confirmed by this support, "my influ-
ence with my daughter. Do you decline to take those letters, Mr. Copper-
field? " For I had laid them on the table.
   Yes. I told him I hoped he would not think it wrong, but I couldn't
possibly take them from Miss Murdstone.
    " Nor from me ? " said Mr. Spenlow.

   No, I replied with the profoundest respect ; nor from him.
    " Very well ! " said Mr. Spenlow.

   A silence succeeding, I was undecided whether to go or stay. At
length I was moving quietly towards the door, with the intention of saying
that perhaps I should consult his feelings best by withdrawing : when he
said, with his hands in his coat pockets, into which it was as much as he
could do to get them; and with what I should call, upon the whole, a
 decidedly          air :
    " You are probably aware, Mr. Copperfield, that I am not altogether
destitute of worldly possessions, and that my daughter is my nearest and
dearest relative ? " - -
    I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect, that I hoped the error into
which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love, did not
induce him to think me mercenary too ?
        I don't allude to the matter in that light," said Mr. Spenlow. "It
would be better for yourself, and all of us, if you were mercenary, Mr.
 Copperfield-I mean, if you were more discreet and less influenced by all
this youthful nonsense. No. I merely say, with quite another view, you
are probably aware I have some property to bequeath to my child? "
    I certainly supposed so.
    'c And you can hardly think," said Mr. Spenlow, "having experience of
what we see, in the Commons here, every day, of the various unaccount-
able and negligent proceedings of men, in respect of their testamentary
arrangements-of all subjects, the one on which perhaps the strangest
revelations of human inconsistency are to be met with-but that mine are
made ? "
   I inclined my head in acquiescence.
   " I should not allow," said Mr. Spenlow, with an evident increase oi
pious sentiment, and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon his
toes and heels alternately, "my suitable provision for my child to be influ-
enced by a piece of youthful folly like the present. I t is mere folly.
Mere nonsense. I n a little while, it will weigh lighter than any feather,
But I might-I might-if this silly business were not completely relin-
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          391
quished altogether, be induced in some anxious moment to guard her from,
and surround her with protections against, the consequences of, any foolish
step in the way of marriage. Now, Mr. Copperfield, I hope that you will
not render it necessary for me to open, even for a quarter of an hour, that
closed page in the book of life, and unsettle, even for a quarter of an hour,
grave affairs long since composed."
   There was a serenity, a tranquillity, a calm-sunset air about him, which
quite affected me. H e was so peaceful and resigned-clearly had his
affairs in such perfect train, and so systematically wound up-that he was
a man to feel touched in the contemplation of. I really think I saw tears
rise to his eyes, from the depth of his own feeling of all this.
   But what could I d o ? I could not deny Dora and my own heart.
When he told me I had better take a week to consider of what he had said,
how could I say I wouldn't take a week, yet how could I fail to know that
no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine ?
   " I n the meantime, confer with Miss Trotwood, or with any person with
any knowledge of life," said Mr. Spenlow, adjusting his cravat with both
hands. " Take a week, Mr. Copperfield."
   I submitted; and, with a countenance as expressive as I was able to
make it of dejected and despairing constancy, came out of the room.
Miss Murdstone's heavy eyebrows followed me to the door-I say her
eyebrows rather than her eyes, because they were much more important
in her face-and she looked so exactly as she used to look, at about that
hour of the morning, in our parlour at Blunderstone, that I could have
fancied I had been breaking down in my lessons again, and that the dead
weight on my mind was that horrible old spelling-book, with oval
woodcuts, shaped, to my youthful fancy, like the glasses out of spectacles.
   When I got to the office, and, shutting out old Tiffey and the rest of
them with my hands, sat at my desk, in my ow11 particular nook, thinking
of this earthquake that had taken place so unexpectedly, and in the bitter-
ness of my spirit cursing Jip, I fell into such a state of torment about
Dora, that I wonder I did not take up my hat and rush insanely to Nor-
wood. The idea of their frightening her, and making her cry, and of my
not being there to comfort her, was so excruciating, that it impelled me
to write a wild letter to Mr. Spenlow, beseeching him not to visit upon
her the consequences of my awful destiny. I implored him to spare her
gentle nature-not to crush a fragile flower-and addressed him generally,
to the best of my remembrance, as if, instead of being her father, he had
been an Ogre, or the Dragon of Wantley. This letter I sealed and laid
upon his desk before he returned; and when he came in, I saw him,
through the half-opened door of his room, take it up and read it.
   H e said nothing about it all the morning; but before he went away in
the afternoon he called me in, and told me that I need not make myself
at all uneasy about his daughter's happiness. He had assured her, he
said, that it was all nonsense; and he had nothing more to say to her.
H e believed he was an indulgent father (as indeed he was), and I might
spare myself any solicitude on her account.
   " You may make it necessary, if you are foolish or obstinate, Mr. Cop-

perfield," he observed, " for me to send my daughter abroad again, for a
term; but I have a better opinion of you. I hope you will be wiser than
392           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

that, in a few days. As to Miss Murdstone," for I had alluded to her in
the letter, " I respect that lady's vigilance, and feel obliged to her ; but she
has strict charge to avoid the subject. All I desire, Mr. Copperfield, is,
that it should be forgotten. All you have got to do, Mr. Copperfield, is,
to forget it."
   All! I n the note I wrote to lfiss Mills, I bitterly quoted this senti-
ment. All I had to do, I said, with gloomy sarcasm, was to forget Dora.
That was all, and what was that ! I entreated Miss Mills to see me, that
evening. If it could not be done with Mr. Mills's sanction and concur-
rence, I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the
Mangle was. I informed her that my reason was tottering on its throne,
and only she, Miss Mills, could prevent its being deposed. I signed
myself, hers distractedly; and I couldn't help feeling, when I read this
composition over, before sending it by a porter, that it was something in
the style of Mr. Micawber.
   However, I sent it. At night I repaired to Miss Mills's street, and
walked up and down, until I was stealthily fetched in by Miss Mills's
maid, and taken the area way to the back kitchen. I have since seen
reason to believe that there was nothing on earth to prevent my going in
at the front door, and being shown up into the drawing-room, except Miss
Mills's love of the romantic and mysterious.
   I n the back kitchen, I raved as became me. I went there, I suppose,
to make a fool of myself, and I am quite sure I did it. Miss Mills had
received a hasty note from Dora, telling her that all was discovered, and
saying, " Oh pray come to me, Julia, do, do ! " But Miss Mills, mistrust-
ing the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers, had not yet
gone ; and we were all benighted in the Desert of Sahara.
   Miss l!tills had a wonderful flow of words, and liked to pour them out.
I could not help feeling, though she mingled her tears with mine, that
she had a dreadful luxury in our afflictions. She petted them, as I may
say, and made the most of them. A deep gulf, she observed, had
opened between Dora and me, and Love could only span it with its
rainbow. Love must suffer in this stern world; it ever had been so, it
ever would be so. No matter, Miss Mills remarked. Hearts confined by
cobwebs would burst at last, and then Love was avenged.
   This was small consolation, but Miss Mills wouldn't encourage fallacious
hopes. She made me much more wretched than I was before, and I felt
(and told her with the deepest gratitude) that she was indeed a friend.
We resolved that she should go to Dora the first thing in the morning,
and find some means of assuring her, either by looks or words, of my
devotion and misery. We parted, overwhelmed with grief; and I think
Miss Mills enjoyed herself completely.
   I confided all to my aunt when I got home ; and in spite of all she could
say to me, went to bed despairing. I got up despairing, and went
out despairing. I t was Saturday morning, and I went straight to the
Commons.
   I was surprised, when I came within sight of our office-door, to see the
ticket-porters standing outside talking together, and some half dozen
stragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up. I quickened my
pace, and, passing among them, wondering at their looks, went hurriedly in.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           393
   The clerks were there, but nobody was doing anything. Old Tiffey, for
the first time in his life I should think, was sitting on somebody else's
stool, and had not hung up his hat.
    " This is a dreadful calamity, Mr. Copperfield," said he, as I entered.

    " What is ? " I exclaimed.     "What's the matter ? "
    " Don't you know?" cried Tiffey, and all the rest of them, coming
round me.
    '' No ! " said I, looking from face to face.
    " Mr. Spenlow," said Tiffey.

    " What about him! "

    " Dead! "
    I thought it was the office reeling, and not I, as one of the clerks
caught hold of me. They sat me down in a chair, untied my neckcloth,
and brought me some water. I have no idea whether this took any time.
    " ~ e a g "? said I.
    " He dined in town yesterday, and drove down in the phaeton by him-
 self," said Tiffey, " having sent his own groom home by the coach, as he
 sometimes did, you know -"
     " Well ? "
     " The phaeton went home without him. The horses stopped at the
 stable gate. The man went out with a lantern. Nobody in the carriage."
     " Had they run away ? "

     " They were not hot," said Tiffey, putting on his glasses ; "no hotter, I

 understand, than they would have been, going down at the usual pace.
 The reins were broken, but they had been dragging on the ground. The
 house was roused up directly, and three of them went out along the road.
 They found him a mile off."
     " More than a mile off, Mr. Tiffey," interposed a junior.
     " Was i t ? I believe you are right," said Tiffey,-"more than a mile off
 -not far from the church-lying partly on the road-side, and partly on
 the path, upon his face. Whether he fell out in a fit, or got out, feeling
 ill before the fit came on-or even whether he was quite dead then,
 though there is no doubt he was quite insensible-no one appears to
 know. If he breathed, certainly he never spoke. Medical assistance was
 got as soon as possible, but it was quite useless."
     I cannot describe the state of mind into which I was thrown by this
 intelligence. The shock of such an event happening so suddenly, and
 happening to one with whom I had been in any respect at variance-the
 appalling vacancy in the room he had occupied so lately, where his chair
 and table seemed to wait for him, and his handwriting of yesterday was
 like a ghost-the indefinable impossibility of separating him from the
 place, and feeling, when the door opened, as if he might come in-the lazy
 hush and rest there was in the office, and the insatiable relish with which
 our people talked about it, and other people came in and out all day, and
 gorged themselves with the subject-this is easily intelligible to any one.
 What I cannot describe is, how, in the innermost recesses of my own heart,
 I had a lurking jealousy even of Death. How I felt as if its might would
 push me from my ground in Dora's thoughts. How I was, in a grudging
 way I have no words for, envious of her grief. How it made me restless
 to think of her weeping to others, or being consoled by others. How I had
394            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

a grasping, avaricious wish to shut out everybody from her but myself,
and to be all in all to her, at that unseasonable time of all times.
   I n the trouble of this state of mind-not exclusively my own, I hope,
but known to others-I went down to Xorwood that night; and finding
from one of the servants, when I made my inquiries at the door, that
Miss Wills was there, got my aunt to direct a letter to her, which I wrote.
I deplored the untimely death of Mr. Spenlow most sincerely, and shed
tears in doing so. I entreated her to tell Dora, if Dora were in a state to
hear it, that he had spoken to me with the utmost kindness and con-
sideration; and had coupled nothing but tenderness, not a single or
reproachful word, with her name. I know I did this selfishly, to have
my name brought before her ; but I tried to believe it was an act of justice
to his memory. Perhaps I did believe it.
   My aunt received a few lines next day in reply; addressed, outside, to
her ; within, to me. Dora was overcome by grief; and when her friend
had asked her should she send her love to me, had only cried, as she was
always crying, " Oh, dear papa ! oh, poor papa! " But she had not said
No, and that I made the most of.
   Mr. Jorkins, who had been at Norwood since the occurrence, came to
the office a few days afterwards. He and Tiffey were closeted together
for some few moments, and then Tiffey looked out at the door and beckoned
me in.
   " Oh ! " said Mr. Jorkins.      " Mr. Tiffey and myself, Mr. Copperfield,
are about to examine the desk, the drawers, and other such repositories of the
deceased, with the view of sealing up his private papers, and searching
for a Will. There is no trace of any, elsewhere. I t may be as well for
you to assist us, if you please."
   I had been in agony to obtain some knowledge of the circumstances
in which my Dora would be placed-as, in whose guardianship, and
so forth-and this was something towards it, We began the search a t
once; Mr. Jorkins unlocking the drawers and desks, and we all taking
out the papers. The office-papers we placed on one side, and the private
papers (which were not numerous) on the other. We were very grave ;
and when we came to a stray seal, or pencil-case, or ring, or any little
article of that kind which we associated personally with him, we spoke
very low.
   We had sealed up several packets ; and were still going on dustily and
quietly, when Mr. Jorkins said to us, applying exactly the same words to
his late partner as his late partner had applied to him :
   " Mr. Spenlow was very difficult to move from the beaten track. You
know what he was ! I am disposed to think he had made no will."
   " Oh, I know he had ! " said I.
   They both stopped and looked at me.
   " On the very day when I last saw him," said I, "he told me that he
had, and that his affairs were long since settled."
   Mr. Jorkins and old Tiffey shook their heads with one accord.
   " That looks unpromising," said Tiffey.

   "Very unpromising," said Mr. Jorkins.
   " Surely you don't doubt-" I began.
   " My good Mr. Copperfield ! " said Tiffey, laying his hand upon my arm,
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            395
and shutting up both his eyes as he shook his head: " if you had been in
the Commons as long as I have, you would know that there is no subject
on which men are so inconsistent, and so little to be trusted."
   " Why, bless my soul, he made that very remark!" I replied persistently.
   " I should call that almost final," observed Tiffey. "My opinion is-
no will."
   I t appeared a wonderful thing to me, but it turned out that there was
no will. He had never so much as thought of making one, so far as his
papers afforded any evidence; for there was no kind of hint, sketch, or
memorandum, of any testamentary intention whatever. What was scarcely
less astonishing to me, was, that his affairs were in a most disordered
state. I t was extremely difficult, I heard, to make out what he owed, or
what he had paid, or of what he died possessed. I t was considered likely
that for years he could have had no clear opinion on these subjects himself.
By little and little it came out, that, in the competition on all points of
appearance and gentility then running high in the Commons, he had
spent more than his professional income, which was not a very large one,
and had reduced his private means, if they ever had been great (which was
exceedingly doubtful), to a very low ebb indeed. There was a sale of the
furniture and lease, at Norwood; and Tiffey told me, little thinking how
interested I was in the story, that, paying all the just debts of the deceased,
and deducting his share of outstanding bad and doubtful debts due to the
firm, he wouldn't give a thousand pounds for all the assets remaining.
   This was at the expiration of about six weeks. I had suffered tortures
all the time; and thought I really must have laid violent hands upon
myself, when Miss Mills still reported to me, that my broken-hearted little
Dora would say nothing, when I was mentioned, but "Oh, poor papa ! Oh,
dear papa !" Also, that she had no other relations than two aunts, maiden
sisters of Mr. Spenlow, who lived at Putney, and who had not held any
other than chance communication with their brother for many years.
Not that they had ever quarrelled (Miss Mills informed me); but that
having been, on the occasion of Dora's christening, invited to tea, when
they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner, they had
expressed their opinion in writing, that it was "better for the happiness
of all parties" that they should stay away. Since which they had gone
their road, and their brother had gone his.
   These two ladies now emerged from their retirement, and proposed to
take Dora to live at Putney. Dora, clinging to them both, and weeping,
exclaimed, " O yes, aunts ! Please take Julia &Iills and me and Jip to
Putney ! " So they went, very soon after the funeral.
   How I found time to haunt Putney, I am sure I don't know; but I
contrived, by some means or other, to prowl about the neighbourhood
pretty often. Miss Mills, for the more exact discharge of the duties of
friendship, kept a journal; and she used to meet me sometimes, on the
Common, and read it, or (if she had not time to do that) lend it to me.
How I treasured up the entries, of which I subjoin a sample !
   "Monday. My sweet D. still much depressed. Headache. Called
attention to J. as being beautifully sleek. D. fondled J. Associations
thus awakened, opened floodgates of sorrow. Rush of grief admitted.
(Are tears the dewdrops of the heart? J. M.)
396          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   "Tuesday. D. weak and nervous. Beautiful in pallor. (Do we not
remark this in moon likewise ? J. M.) D. J. M. and J. took airing in
carriage. J. looking out of window, and barking violently at dustman,
occasioned smile to overspread features of D. (Of such slight links is
chain of life composed ! J. M.)
   " MJednesday. D. comparatively cheerful. Sang to her, as congenial
melody, Evening Bells. Effect not soothing, but reverse. D. inexpres-
sibly affected. Found sobbing afterwards, in own room. Quoted verses
respecting self and young Gazelle. Ineffectually. Also referred to
Patience on Monument. (Qy. Why on monument ? J. M.)
   "Thursday. D. certainly improved. Better night. Slight tinge of

    " Friday.   Day of incident. Man appears in kitchen, with blue bag,

Cook's return, man still argues point, but ultimately goes. J. missing.

direction. No J. D. weeping bitterly, and inconsolable. Renewed
reference to young Gazelle. Appropriate, but unavailing. Towards
evening, strange boy calls. Brought into parlour. Broad nose, but no
balustrades. Says he wants a pound, and knows a dog. Declines to
explain further, though much pressed. Pound being produced by D.
takes Cook to little house, where J. alone tied up to leg of table. Joy of
D. who dances round J, while he eats his supper. Emboldened by this
happy change, mention D. C. upstairs. D. weeps afresh, cries piteously.
 'Oh, don't, don't, don't. I t is so wicked to think of anything but poor
papa !'-embraces J. and sobs herself to sleep. (Must not D. C. confide
himself to the broad pinions of Time? J. M.)"
    Miss Mills and her journal were my sole consolation at this period. To
see her, who had seen Dora but a little while before-to trace the initial
letter of Dora's name through her sympathetic pages-to be made more and
more miserable by her-were my only comforts. I felt as if I had been living
in a palace of cards, which had tumbled down, leaving only Miss Mills
and me among the ruins ; as if some grim enchanter had drawn a magic
circle round the innocent goddess of my heart, which nothing indeed but
those same strong pinions, capable of carrying so many people over so
much, would enable me to enter !

                          CHAPTER XXXIX.
                          WICKFIELD AND HEEP.

    MY aunt, beginning, I imagine, to be made seriously uncomfortable by
my prolonged dejection, made a pretence of being anxious that I should
go to Dover, to see that all was working well at the cottage, which was
let ; and to conclude an agreement, with the same tenant, for a longer term
of occupation. Janet was drafted into the service of Mrs. Strong, where
I saw her every day. She had been undecided, on leaving Dover, whether
or no to give the finishing touch to that renunciation of mankind in
which she had been educated, by marrying a pilot ; but she decided against
that venture. Not so much for the sake of principle, I believe, as because
she happened not to like him.
    Although it required an effort to leave Miss Mills, I fell rather willingly
into my aunt's pretence, as a means of enabling me to pass a few tranquil
hours with Agnes. I consulted the good Doctor relative to an absence of
three days ; and the Doctor wishing me to take that relaxation,-he wished
me to take more ; but my energy could not bear that,-I made up my mind
to go.
    As to the Commons, I had no great occasion to be particular about my
duties in that quarter. To say the truth, we were getting in no very good
odour among the tip-top proctors, and were rapidly sliding down to but a
doubtful position. The business had been indifferent under Mr. Jorkins,
before Mr. Xpenlow's time; and although it had been quickened by the
 infusion of new blood, and by the display which Mr. Spenlow made, still
 it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to bear, without being
 shaken, such a blow as the sudden loss of its active manager. I t fell
  off very much. Mr. Jorkins, notwithstanding his reputation in the firm,
 was an easy-going, incapable, sort of man, whose reputation out of
 doors was not calculated to back it up. I was turned over to him now,
 and when I saw him take h i ssnuff and let the business go, I regretted my
 aunt's thousand pounds more than ever.
     But this was not the worst of it. There were a number of hangers-on
 and outsiders about the Commons, who, without being proctors them-
 selves, dabbled in common-form business, and got it done by real proctors,
 who lent their names in consideration of a share in the spoil;-and there
 were a good many of these too. As our house now wanted business on
 any terms, we joined this noble band ; and threw out lures to the hangers-on
 and outsiders, to bring their business to us. Marriage licenses and small
 probates were what we all looked for, and what paid us best; and the
 competition for these, ran very high indeed. Kidnappers and inveiglers
 were planted in all the avenues of entrance to the Commons, with instruc-
 tions to do their utmost to cut off all persons in mourning, and all
 gentlemen with anything bashful in their appearance, and entice them to
398            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

the offices in which their respective employers were interested; which
instructions were so well observed, that I myself, before I was known by
sight, was twice hustled into the premises of our principal opponent.
The conflicting interests of these touting gentlemen being of a nature to
irritate their feelings, personal collisions took place ; and the Commons
was even scandalised by our principal inveigler (who had formerly been in
the wine trade, and afterwards in the sworn brokery line) walking about for
some days with a black eye. Any one of these scouts used to think
nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black out of a vehicle, killing
any proctor whom she inquired for, representing his employer as the lawful
successor and representative of that proctor, and bearing the old lady off
(sometimes greatly affected) to his employer's office. Many captives were
brought to me in this way. As to marriage licenses, the competition rose
to such a pitch, that a shy gentleman in want of one, had.nothing to do
but submit himself to the first inveigler, or be fought for, and become the
prey of the strongest. One of our clerks, who was an outsider, used, in
the height of this contest, to sit with his hat on, that he might be ready
to rush out and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in.
The system of inveigling continues, I believe, to this day. The last time I
was in the Commons, a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced
out upon me from a doorway, and whispering the word "Marriage-
license" in my ear, was with great difficulty prevented from taking me
up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor's.
    From this digression, let me proceed to Dover.
    I found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage; and was
enabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant
inherited her feud, and waged incessant war against donkies. Having
settled the little business I had to transact there, and slept there one
night, I walked on to Canterbury early in the morning. I t was now
winter again; and the fresh, cold windy day, and the sweeping down-
land, brightened up my hopes a little.
    Coming into Canterbury, I loitered through the old streets with a sober
pleasure that calmed my spirits, and eased my heart. There were the
old signs, the old names over the shops, the old people serving in them.
I t appeared so long, since I had been a schoolboy there, that I wondered
the place was so little changed, until I reflected how little I was
changed myself. Strange to say, that quiet influence which was insepa-
rable in my mind from Agnes, seemed to pervade even the city where she
dwelt. The venerable cathedral towers, and the old jackdaws and rooks
whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would
have done; the battered gateways, once stuck full with statues, long
thrown down, and crumbled away, like the reverential pilgrims who had
gazed upon them ; the still nooks, where the ivied growth of centuries
crept over gabled ends and ruined walls ; the ancient houses, the pastoral
landscape of field, orchard, and garden ; everywhere-on everything-
I felt the same serener air, the same calm, thoughtful, softening spirit.
    Arrived at Mr. Wickfield's house, I found, in the little lower-room on
 the ground floor, where Uriah Heep had been of old accustomed to sit,
 Mr. Micawber plying his pen with great assiduity. He was dressed in a
 legal-looking suit of black, and loomed, burly and large, in that small office.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           399
    Mr. Micawber was extremely glad to see me, but a little confused too.
H e would have conducted me immediately into the presence of Uriah, but
I declined.
    " I know the house of old, you recollect," said I, " and will find my
way up stairs. How do you like the law, Mr. Micawber?"
    " My dear Copperfield,"    he replied. "To a man possessed of the
higher imaginative powers, the objection to legal studies is the amount of
detail which they involve. Even in our professional correspondence,"
said Mr. Micawber, glancing at some letters he was writing, " the mind
is not at liberty to soar to any exalted form of expression. Still, it is a
great pursuit. A great pursuit ! "
    H e then told me that he had become the tenant of Uriah Heep's old
house ; and that Mrs. Micawber would be delighted to receive me, once
more, under her own roof.
    " I t is humble," said Mr. Micawber, "-to quote a favourite expression
of my friend Heep; but it may prove the stepping-stone to more
ambitious domiciliary accommodation."
    I asked him whether he had reason, so far, to be satisfied with his friend
Heep's treatment of him ? He got up to ascertain if the door were close
shut, before he replied, in a lower voice :
    "My dear Copperfield, a man who labours under the pressure of
pecuniary embarrassments, is, with the generality of people, at a disad-
vantage. That disadvantage is not diminished, when that pressure neces-
sitates the drawing of stipendiary emoluments, before those emoluments
are strictly due and payable. All I can say is, that my friend Heep has
responded to appeals to which I need not more particularly refer, in a
manner calculated to redound equally to the honour of his head, and of
his heart."
    "I should not have supposed him to be very free with his money
either," I observed.
    "Pardon me ! " said Mr. Micawber, with an air of constraint, "I
 speak of my friend Heep as I have experience."
    " I am glad your experience is so favourable," I returned.
     "You are very obliging, my dear Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber ;
 and hummed a tune.
     " Do you see much of Mr. Wickfield? " I asked, to change the subject.
     " Not much," said Mr. Micawber, slightingly. " Mr. Wickfield is, I
 dare say, a man of very excellent intentions; but he is-in short, he
 is obsolete."
     "I am afraid his partner seeks to make him so," said I.
     " My dear Copperfield ! " returned Mr. Micawber, after some uneasy

 evolutions on his stool, "allow me to offer a remark ! I am here, in a
 capacity of confidence. I am here, in a position of trust. The discussion
 of some topics, even with Mrs. Micawber herself (so long the partner of
 my various vicissitudes, and a woman of a remarkable lucidity of intellect),
 is, I am led to consider, incompatible with the functions now devolving
 on me. I would therefore take the liberty of suggesting that in our
 friendly intercourse-which I trust will never be disturbed!-we          draw
 a line. On one side of this line," said Mr. Micawber, representing
 it on the desk with the office ruler, "is the whole range of the human
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

intellect, with a trifling exception; on the other, is that exception ; that is
to say, the affairs of Messrs. Wickfield and Keep, with all belonging and
appertaining thereunto. I trust I give no offence to the companion of
my youth, in submitting this proposition to his cooler judgment? "
   Though I saw an uneasy change in Mr. Micawber, which sat tightly on
him, as if his new duties were a misfit, I felt I had no right to be
offended. My telling him so, appeared to relieve him; and he shook
hands with me.
   "I am charmed, Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, " let me assure
you, with Miss Wickfield. She is a very superior young lady, of very
remarkable attractions, graces, and virtues. Upon my honour," said Mr.
Micawber, indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest
air, " I do Homage to Miss Wickfield ! Hem ! "
   "I am glad of that, at least," said I.
   " If you had not assured us, my dear Copperfield, on the occasion of
that agreeable afternoon we had the happiness of passing with you, that
D was your favourite letter," said Mr. Micawber, " I should unquestion-
ably have supposed that A had been so."
   We have all some experience of a feeling, that comes over us occasionally,
of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before, in
a remote time-of        our having been surrounded, dim ages ago, by the
same faces, objects, and circumstances-of our knowing perfectly what
will be said next, as if we suddenly remembered it ! I never had this
mysterious impression more strongly in my life, than before he uttered
those words.
   I took my leave of Mr. Micawber, for the time, charging him with my
best remembrances to all at home. As I left him, resuming his stool
and his pen, and rolling his head in his stock, to get it into easier writing
order, I clearly perceived that there was something interposed between him
and me, since he had come into his new functions which prevented our
getting at each other as we used to do, and quite altered the character of
our intercourse.
   There was no one in the quaint old drawing-room, though it presented
tokens of Mrs. Heep's whereabout. I looked into the room still belonging
to Agnes, and saw her sitting by the fire, at a pretty old fashioned desk
she had, writing.
   My darkening the light made her look up. What a pleasure to be the
cause of that bright change in her attentive face, and the object of that
sweet regard andwelcome-!
   "Ah, Agnes!" said I, when we were sitting together, side by side;
"I have missed you so much, lately ! "
   " Indeed ? " she replied.    " Again !  And so soon ? "
   I shook my head.
   " I don't know how it is, Agnes; I seem to want some faculty of mind
that I ought to have. You were so much in the habit of thinking for me,
in the happy old days here, and I came so naturally to you for counsel
and support, that I really think I have missed acquiring i t ? "
   " And what is it ? " said Agnes, cheerfully.

   " I don't know what to call it," I replied. " I think I am earnest and
persevering ? "
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   "    I am sure of it," said Agnes.
      "And patient, Agnes? " I enquired, with a little hesitation.
      "Yes," returned Agnes, laughing. " Pretty well."
      "And yet," said I, " I get so miserable and worried, and am so
  unsteady and irresolute in my power of assuring myself, that I know I
  must want-shall I call it-reliance, of some kind? "
      " Call it so, if you will," said Agnes.
      "Well ! " I returned. " See here ! You come to London, I rely on
  you, and I have an object and a course at once. I am driven out of it,
  I come here, and in a moment I feel an altered person. The circumstances
  that distressed me are not changed, since I came into this room; hut an
  influence comes over me in that short interval that alters me, oh, how much
 for the better ! What is i t ? What is your secret, Agnes? "
     Her head was bent down, looking at the fire.
     " I t 's the old story," said I.   "Don't laugh, when I say it was always
 the same in little things as it is in greater ones. My old troubles were
 nonsense, and now they are serious ; but whenever I have gone away from
 my adopted sister-"
     Agnes looked up-with such a Heavenly face !-and gave me her hand,
  which I kissed.
     "Whenever I have not had you, Agnes, to advise and approve in the
 beginning, I have seemed to go wild, and to get into all sorts of difficulty.
 When I have come to you, at last (as I have always done), I have come to
 peace and happiness. I come home, now, tike a tired traveller, and find
 such a blessed sense of rest ! "
     I felt so deeply what I said, it affected me so sincerely, that my voice
 failed, and I covered my face with my hand, and broke into tears. I write
 the truth. Whatever contradictions and inconsistencies there were within
 me, as there are within so many of us; whatever might have been so
 different, and so much better; whatever I had done, in which I had per-
 versely wandered away from the voice of my own heart ; I knew nothing
 of: I only knew that I was fervently in earnest, when I felt the rest and
 peace of having Agnes near me.
     I n her placid sisterly manner ; with her beaming eyes ; with her tender
 voice; and with that sweet composure, which had long ago made the
 house that held her quite a sacred place to me ; she soon won me from this
 weakness, and ledme on to tell all that had happened since our last meeting.
     "And there is not another word to tell, Agnes," said I, when I had
 made an end of my confidence. " Now, my reliance is on you."
     "But it must not be on me, Trotwood," returned Agnes, with a pleasant
smile. " I t must be on some one else."
     " On Dora ? " said I.
     " Assuredly."
     " Why, I have not mentioned, Agnes," said I, a little embarrassed,
"that Dora is rather difficult to-I would not, for the world, say, to rely
upon, because she is the soul of purity and truth-but rather difficult
to-I hardly know how to express it, really, Agnes. She is a timid little
thing, and easily disturbed and frightened. Some time ago, before her
father's death, when I thought it right to mention to her-but I'll tell
you, if you will bear with me, how it was."

402            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    Accordingly, I told Agnes about my declaration of poverty, about the
 cookery-book, the housekeeping accounts, and all the rest of it.
    " Oh, Trotwood ! " she remonstrated, with a smile. "Just your old
headlong way ! You might have been in earnest in striving to get on in
the world, without being so very sudden with a timid, loving, inexperienced
girl. Poor Dora ! "
    I never heard such sweet forbearing kindness expressed in avoice, as
 she expressed in making this reply. I t was as if I had seen her admir-
ingly and tenderly embracing Dora, and tacitly reproving me, by her con-
 siderate protection, for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart. I t was
as if I had seen Dora, in all her fascinating artlessness, caressing Agnes,
and thanking her, and coaxingly appealing against me, and loving me with
all her childish innocence.
    I felt so grateful to Agnes, and admired her so ! I saw those two
together, in a bright perspective, such well-associated friends, each adorning
the other so much !
    " What ought I to do then, Agnes ? " I inquired, after looking at the
fire a little while. "What would it be right to do?"
    " I think," said Agnes, " that the honourable course to take, would be

to write to those two ladies. Don't you think that any secret course is
an unworthy one ? "
    "Yes. If you think so," said I.
    " I am poorly qualified to judge of such matters," replied Agnes, with
 a modest hesitation, "but I certainly feel-in short, I feel that your
being secret and clandestine, is not being like yourself,"
    " Like myself, in the too high opinion you have of me, Agnes, I am
afraid," said I.
    "Like yourself in the candour of your nature," she returned; "and
therefore I would write to those two ladies. I would relate, as plainly
and as openly as possible, all that has taken place ; and I would ask their
permission to visit sometimes, at their house. Considering that you are
young, and striving for a place in life, I think it would be well to say that
you would readily abide by any conditions they might impose upon you.
I would entreat them not to dismiss your request, without a reference to
Dora ; and to discuss it with her when they should think the time suitable.
I would not be too vehement," said Agnes, gently, " or propose too much.
I would trust to my fidelity and perseverance-and to Dora."
   "But if they were to frighten Dora again, Agnes, by speaking to her,"
said I. " And if Dora were to cry, and say nothing about me ! "
   " I s that likely ? " inquired Agnes, with the same sweet consideration in
her face.
   " God bless her, she is as easily scared as a bird," said I. I t might
                                                                   '$

be ! Or if the two Miss Spenlows (elderly ladies of that sort are odd
characters sometimes) should not be likely persons to address in that
way ! "
   " I don't think, Trotwood," returned Agnes, raising her soft eyes to

mine, " I would consider that. Perhaps it would be better only to con-
sider whether it is right to do this; and, if it is, to do it."
   I had no longer any doubt on the subject. With a lightened heart,
though with a profound sense of the weighty importance of my task, I
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

  devoted the whole afternoon to the composition of the draft of this
 letter; for which great purpose, Agnes relinquished her desk to me. But
  first I went down stairs to see Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep.
      I found Uriah in possession of a new, plaster-smelling office, built out in
 the garden; looking extraordinarily mean, in the midst of a quantity of
 books and papers. He received me in his usual fawning way, and pre-
 tended not to have heard of my arrival from Mr. Micawber ; a pretence
 I took the liberty of disbelieving. He accompanied me into Mr.
 Wickfield's room, which was the shadow of its former self-having been
 divested of a variety of conveniences, for the accommodation of the
 new partner-and        stood before the fire, warming his back, and shaving
 his chin with his bony hand, while Mr. Wickfield and I exchanged
 greetings.
      " You stay with us, Trotwood, while you remain in Canterbury? " said
 Mr. Wickfield, not without a glance at Uriah for his approval.
      " I s there room for me ? " said I.

      " I am sure, Master Copperfield-I     should say Mister, but the other
 comes so natural," said Uriah,--" I would turn out of your old room with
 pleasure, if it would be agreeable."
      " No, no," said Mr. Wickfield. " Why should you be inconvenienced ?
 There 's another room. There's another room."
      " Oh, but you know," returned Uriah, with a grin, "I should really be
delighted ! "
     To cut the matter short, I said I would have the other room or none at
 all ; so it was settled that I should have the other room : and, taking my
leave of the firm until dinner, I went up stairs again.
     I had hoped, to have no other companion than Agnes. But Mrs. Heep
had asked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the h e , in that
room ; on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable for her rheu-
matics, as the wind then was, than the drawing-room or dining-parlour.
Though I could almost have consigned her to the mercies of the wind on
 the topmost pinnacle of the Cathedral, without remorse, I made a virtue of
 necessity, and gave her a friendly salutation.
      "I'm umbly thankful to you, sir," said Mrs. Heep, in acknowledgment of
 my inquiries concerning her health, " but I 'm only pretty well. I haven't
 much to boast of. If I could see my Uriah well settled in life, I couldn't
 expect much more I think. How do you think my Ury looking, sir ?"
      I thought him looking as villanous as ever, and I replied that I saw no
 change in him.
      " Oh, don't you think he's changed? " said Mrs. Heep.           " There I
 must umbly beg leave to differ from you. Don't you see a thinness
in him ? "
      "Not more than usual," I replied.
     " Don't you though ! " said Mrs. Heep.      "But you don't take notice
of him with a mother's eye ! "
     His mother's eye was an evil eye to the rest of the world, I thought as
it met mine, howsoever affectionate to him; and I believe she and her son
were devoted to one another. I t passed me, and went on to Agnes.
     '< Don't you see a wasting and a wearing in him, Miss Wickfield? "
inquired Mrs. Heep.
                                                              D D 2
404            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  " No," said Agnes, quietly pursuing the work on which she was engaged.
" You are too solicitous about him. He is very well."
   Mrs. Heep, with a prodigious sniff, resumed her knitting.
   She never left off, or left us for a moment. I had arrived early in the day,
and we had still three or four hours before dinner; but she sat there,
plying her knitting-needles as monotonously as an hour-glass might have
poured out its sands, She sat on one side of the fire ; I sat at the desk in
front of it ; a little beyond me, on the other side, sat Agnes. Whensoever,
slowly pondering over my letter, I lifted up my eyes, and meeting the
thoughtful face of Agnes, saw it clear, and beam encouragement upon
me, with its own angelic expression, I was conscious presently of the
evil eye passing me, and going on to her, and coming back to me again, and
dropping furtively upon the knitting. What the knitting was, I don't
know, not being learned in that art ; but it looked like a net ; and as
she worked away with those Chinese chopsticks of knitting-needles, she
showed in the firelight like an ill-looking enchantress, baulked as yet by the
radiant goodness opposite, but getting ready for a cast of her net by-and-by.
   At dinner she maintained her watch, with the same unwinking eyes.
After dinner, her son took his turn; and when Mr. Wickfield, himself, and
I were left alone together, leered at me, and writhed until I could hardly
bear it. I n the drawing-room, there was the mother knitting and watch-
ing again. All the time that Agnes sang and played, the mother sat at the
piano. Once she asked for a particular ballad, which she said her Ury
(who was yawning in a great chair) doted on; and at intervals she looked
round at him, and reported to Agnes that he was in raptures with the
music. But she hardly ever spoke-I question if she ever did-without
making some mention of him. I t was evident to me that this was the
duty assigned to her.
   This lasted until bedtime. To have seen the mother and son, like two
great bats hanging over the whole house, and darkening it with their ugly
forms, made me so uncomfortable, that I would rather have remained
down stairs, knitting and all, than gone to bed. I hardly got any sleep.
Next day the knitting and watching began again, and lasted all day.
   I had not an opportunity of speaking to Agnes, for ten minutes. I
could barely show her my letter. I proposed to her to walk out with
mp; but Mrs. Reep repeatedly complaining that she was worse, Agnes
charitably remained within, to bear her company. Towards the twilight
I went out by myself, musing on what I ought to do, and whether I was
justified in withholding from Agnes, any longer, what Uriah Heep had
told me in London; for that began to trouble me again, very much.
   I had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town, upon
the Ramsgate road, where there was a good path, when I was hailed,
through the dusk, by somebody behind me. The shambling figure, and
the scanty great coat, were not to be mistaken. I stopped, and Uriah
Heep came up.
   " Well ? " said I.
   "How fast you walk! " said he. "My legs are pretty long, but
you've given 'em quite a job."
   "Where are you going? " said I.
   " I am coming with you, Master Copperfield, if you'll allow me the
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            405
pleasure of a walk with an old acquaintance." Saying this, with a jerk of
his body, which might have been either propitiatory or derisive, he fell
into step beside me.
    " Uriah ! " said I, as civilly as I could, after a silence.

    " Master Copperfield ! " said Uriah.

    " To tell you the truth (at which you will not be offended), I came out
to walk alone, because I have had so much company."
    He looked at me sideways, and said with his hardest grin, " You mean
mother ? "
    " Why yes, I do," said I.

    "Ah ! But you know we're so very umble," he returned. "And
having such a knowledge of our own umbleness, we must really take care
that we 're not pushed to the wall by them as isn't umble. All stratagems
are fair in love, sir."
    Raising his great hands until they touched his chin, he rubbed them
softly, and softly chuckled ; looking as like a malevolent baboon, I thought,
as anything human could look.
    " You see," he said, still hugging himself in that unpleasant way, and
shaking his head at me, "you 're quite a dangerous rival, Master Copper-
field. You always was, you know."
    " Do you set a watch upon Miss Wickfield, and make her home no

home, because of me ? " said I.
    " Oh ! Master Copperfield ! Those are very arsh words," he replied.

    " Put my meaning into any words you like," said I.          "You know what
it is, Uriah, as well as I do."
    " Oh no ! You must put it into words," he said. " Oh, really ! 'I
couldn't myself."
    " Do you suppose," said I, constraining myself to be very temperate

and quiet with him, on account of Agnes, " that I regard Miss Wickfield
otherwise than as a very dear sister? "
    " Well, Master Copperfield," he replied, "you perceive I am not bound
to answer that question. You may not, you know. But then, you see,
you may ! "
    Anything to equal the low cunning of his visage, and of his shadowless
 eyes without the ghost of an eyelash, I never saw.
    " Come, then ! " said I.      " For the sake of Miss Wickfield --"

    " My Agnes ! " he exclaimed, with a sickly, angular contortion of him-

 self. " Would you be so good as call her Agnes, Master Copperfield ! "
    " For the sake of Agnes Wickfield-Heaven bless her ! "
    " Thank you for that blessing, Master Copperfield ! " he interposed.
    "I will tell you what I should, under any other circumstances, as soon
 have thought of telling to-Jack Ketch."
    " To who, sir? " said Uriah, stretching out his neck, and shading his

 ear with his hand.
    " To the hangman," I returned.         " The most unlikely person I could
 think of,"-though      his own face had suggested the allusion quite as a
 natural sequence. " I am engaged to another young lady. I hope that
 contents you."
    " Upon your soul? " said Uriah.

    I was about indignantly to give my assertion the confirmation he
 required, when he caught hold of my hand, and gave it a squeeze.
406           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Oh, Master Copperfield ! " he said. " If you had only had the con-
descension to return my confidence when I poured out the fulness of my
art, the night I put you so much out of the way by sleeping before your
sitting-room fire, I never should have doubted you. As it is, I' m sure
I'll take off mother directly, and only too appy. I know you '11 excuse
the precautions of affection, won't you? What a pity, Master Copper-
field, that you didn't condescend to return my confidence ! I ' m sure
I gave you every opportunity. But you never have condescended to
me, as much as I could have wished. I know you have never liked me, as
I have liked you ! "
    All this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishey fingers,
while I made every effort I decently could to get it away. But I was
quite unsuccessful. He drew it under the sleeve of his mulberry-
colored great coat, and I walked on, almost upon compulsion, arm in
arm with him.
    " Shall we turn? " said Uriah, by-and-by wheeling me face about

towards the town, on which the early moon was now shining, silvering
the distant windows.
    " Before we leave the subject, you ought to understand," said I,
breaking a pretty long silence, " that I believe Agnes Wickfield to be as
far above you, and as far removed from all your aspirations, as that moon
herself! "
    " Peaceful !    Ain't she ! " said Uriah. " Very ! Now confess, Master
 Copperfield,that you havn't liked me quite as I have liked you. All along
you've thought me too umble now, I shouldn't wonder ? "
    " I am not fond of professions of humility," I returned, " or professions
 of anything else."
    " There now ! " said Uriah, looking flabby and lead-coloured in the

moonlight. " Didn't I know it! But how little you think of the
rightful umbleness of a person in my station, Master Copperfield ! Father
and me was both brought up at a foundation school for boys ; and mother,
she was likewise brought up at a public, sort of charitable, establishment.
They taught us all a deal of umbleness-not much else that I know of,
from morning to night. We was to be umble to this person, and umble
to that; and to pull off our caps here, and to make bows there; and
alwavs to know our dace. and abase ourselves before our betters. And
we <ad such a lot of betiers ! Father got the monitor-medal by being
umble. So did I. Father got made a sexton by being umble. He had
the character, among the gentlefolks, of being such a well-behaved man,
that they were determined to bring him in. ' Be umble, Uriah,' says
father to me, ' and you '11 get on. I t was what was always being dinned
into you and me at school; it's what goes down best. Be umble,' says
father, ' and you '11 do ! ' And really it ain't done bad ! "
    I t was the first time it had ever occurred to me, that this detestable
cant of false humility might have originated out of the Heep family.
 I had seen the harvest, but had never thought of the seed.
    " When I was quite a young boy," said Uriah, " I got to know what
 umbleness did, and I took to it. I ate umble pie with an appetite.
 I stopped at the umble point of my learning, and says I, 'Hold hard ! '
 When you offered to teach me latin, I knew better. 'People like to
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         407
be above you,' says father, ' keep yourself down.' I am very umble to
the present moment, Master Copperfield, but I've got a little power ! "
   And he said all this-I knew, as I saw his face in the moonlight-
that I might understand he was resolved to recompense himself by using
his power. I had never doubted his meanness, his craft and malice ; but
I fully comprehended now, for the first time, what a base, unrelenting, and
revengeful spirit, must have been engendered by this early, and this long,
suppression.
   His account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable result,
that it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he might have another
hug of himself under the chin. Once apart from him, I was determined
to keep apart; and we walked back, side by side, saying very little more
by the way.
   Whether his spirits were elevated by the communication I had made
to him, or by his having indulged in this retrospect, I don't know; but
they were raised by some influence. He talked more at dinner than was
usual with him; asked his mother (off duty, from the moment of our
re-entering the house), whether he was not growing too old for a bachelor;
and once looked at Agnes so, that I would have given all I had, for leave
to knock him down.
   When we three males were left alone after dinner, he got into a more
adventnrous state. He had taken little or no wine; and I presume it was
the mere insolence of triumph that was upon him, flushed perhaps by the
temptation my presence furnished to its exhibition.
   I had observed yesterday, that he tried to entice Mr. Wickfield to drink;
and, interpreting the look which Agnes had given me as she went out, had
limited myself to one glass, and then proposed that we should follow her.
I would have done so again to-day ; but Uriah was too quick for me.
   "We seldom see our present visitor, sir," he said, addressing Mr.
Wickfield, sitting, such a contrast to him, at the end of the table, " and I
should propose to give him welcome in another glass or two of wine, if
you have no objections. Mr. Copperfield, your elth and appiness ! "
   I was obliged to make a show of taking the hand he stretched across to
me ; and then, with very different emotions, I took the hand of the broken
 gentleman, his partner.
   " Come, fellow partner,"  said Uriah, " if I may take the liberty,-now,
 suppose you give us something or another appropriate to Copperfield ! "
   I pass over Mr. Wickfield's proposing my aunt, his proposing Mr. Dick,
his proposing Doctor's Commons, his proposing Uriah, his drinking every-
thing twice ; his consciousness of his own weakness, the ineffectual effort
that he made against it ; the struggle between his shame in Uriah's de-
portment, and his desire to conciliate him ; the manifest exultation with
which Uriah twisted and turned, and held him up before me. I t made
me sick at heart to see, and my hand recoils from writing it.
   " Come, fellow partner ! " said Uriah, at last, " I'll give you another
one, and I umbly ask for bumpers, seeing I intend to make it the divinest
of her sex."
   Her father had his empty glass in his hand. I saw him set it down,
look at the picture she was so like, put his hand to his forehead, and
shrink back in his elbow chair.
408            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    '<I'm an umble individual to give you her elth," proceeded Uriah,
 "but I admire-adore her."
    No physical pain that her father's grey head could have borne, I think
could have been more terrible to me, than the mental endurance I saw
compressed now within both his hands.
    "Agnes," said Uriah, either not regarding him, or not knowing what
the nature of his action was, "Agnes Wickfield is, I am safe to say, the
divinest of her sex. May I speak out, among friends ? To be her father
is a proud distinction, but to be her usband-"
    Spare me from ever again hearing such a cry, as that with which her
father rose up from the table !
    "What's the matter ? " said Uriah, turning of a deadly colour. ('Yon
are not gone mad, after all, Mr. Wickfield, I hope ? If I say, I 've an
ambition to make your Agnes my Agnes, I have as good a right to it as
another man. I have a better right to it than any other man!"
    I had my arms round Mr. Wickfield, imploring him by everything that
I could think of, oftenest of all by his love for Agnes, to calm himself a
little. He was mad for the moment ; tearing out his hair, beating his
head, trying to force me from him and to force himself from me, not
answering a word, not looking at or seeing any one; blindly striving
for he knew not what, his face all staring and distorted-a frightful
spectacle.
    I conjured him, incoherently, but in the most impassioned manner, not
to abandon himself to this wildness, but to hear me. I besought him to
think of Agnes, to connect me with Agnes, to recollect how Agnes and I
had grown up together, how I honored her and loved her, how she was
his pride and joy. I tried to bring her idea before him in any form ; I even
reproached him with not having firmness to spare her the knowledge of such
a scene as this. I may have effected something, or his wildness may have
spent itself; but by degrees he struggled less, and began to looli at me-
strangely at first, then with recognition in his eyes. At length he said, "I
know, Trotwood ! My darling child and you-I know ! But look at him ! "
    He pointed to Uriah, pale and glowering in a corner, evidently very
much out in his calculations, and taken by surprise.
    " Look at my torturer," he replied.       " Before him I have step by step
abandoned name and reputation, peace and quiet, house and home."
    " I have kept your name and reputation for you, and your peace and
quiet, and your house and home too," said Uriah, with a sulky, hurried,
defeated air of compromise. " Don't be foolish, Mr. Wickfield. If I have
gone a little beyond what you were prepared for, I can go back I suppose ?
There's no harm done."
    " I looked for single motives in every one," said Mr. Wickfield, " and I

was satisfied I had bound him to me by motives of interest. But see what
he is-oh, see what he is ! "
    " You had better stop him, Copperfield, if you can,"            cried Uriah,
with his long fore-finger pointing towards me. " He 1' 1 say something
presently-mind you !-he '11 be sorry to have said afterwards, and you '11
be sorry to have heard ! "
    " I ' l l say anything ! " cried Mr. Wickfield, with a desperate air. "Why
should I not be in all the world's power if I am in yours ! "
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          409
    " Mind ! I tell you ! " said Uriah, continuing to warn me.      " If you
don't stop his mouth, you 're not his friend ! Why shouldn't you be in
all the world's power, Mr. Wickfield? Because you have got a daughter.
You and me know what we know, don't we? Let sleeping dogs lie-
who wants to rouse 'em? I don't. Can't you see I am as umble as
I can be ? I tell you, if I've gone too far, I ' m sorry. What would you
have, sir ? "
    "Oh, Trotwood, Trotwood! " exclaimed Mr. Wickfield, wringing his
hands. "What I have come down to be, since I first saw yon in this
house ! I was on my downward way then, but the dreary, dreary, road I have
tra~ersedsince ! Weak indulgence has ruined me. Indulgence in remem-
brance, and indulgence in forgetfulness. My natural grief for my child's
mother turned to disease ; my natural love for my child turned to disease.
I have infected everything I touched. I have brought misery on what
I dearly love, I know-You know! I thought it possible that I could
truly love one creature in the world, and not love the rest; I thought
it possible that I could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the world,
and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned. Thus the lessons
of my life have been perverted ! I have preyed on my own morbid coward
heart, and it has preyed on me. Sordid in my grief, sordid in my love,
sordid in my miserable escape from the darker side of both, oh see the ruin
I am, and hate me, shun me ! "
    He dropped into a chair, and weakly sobbed. The excitement into
which he had been roused was leaving him. Uriah came out of his
corner.
    " I don't know all I have done, in my fatuity,"     said Mr. Wickfield,
putting out his hands, as if to deprecate my condemnation. "He knows
best," meaning Uriah Heep, " for he has always been at my elbow, whisper-
ing me. You see the millstone that he is about my neck. You find him
in my house, you find him in my business. You heard him, but a little
time ago. What need have I to say more ! "
    "You haven't need to say so much, nor half so much, nor anything at
all," observed Uriah, half defiant, and half fawning. " You wouldn't have
took it up so, if it hadn't been for the wine. You 1' 1 think better of it
 to-morrow, sir. If I have said too much, or more than I meant, what of
 it P I haven't stood by it ! "
     The door opened, and Agnes, gliding in, without a vestige of colour in
 her face, put her arm round his neck, and steadily said, " Papa, you are
 not well. Come with me ! " EIe laid his head upon her shoulder, as if
 he were oppressed with heavy shame, and went out with her. Her eyes
 met mine for but an instant, yet I saw how much she knew of what
had passed.
     "I didn't expect he'd cut up so rough, Master Copperfield," said
Uriah. "But it 's nothing. I '11 be friends with him to-morrow. It's
for his good. I'm umbly anxious for his good."
     I gave him no answer, and went upstairs into the quiet room where
Agnes had so often sat beside me at my books. Nobody came near me until
late at night. I took up a book, and tried to read. I heard the clocks
 strike twelve, and was still reading, without knowing what I read, when
Agnes touched me.
410              T H E PERSONAL HISTORY AND E X P E R I E N C E

     "You will be going early in the morning, Trotwood. Let us say
 good bye, now ! "
    She had been weeping, but her face then was so calm and beautiful !
    '< Heaven bless you ! " she said, giving me her hand.
    "Dearest Agnes! " I returned, " I see you ask me not to speak of
 to-night-but is there nothing to be done? "
    " There is God to trust in ! " she replied.

    " Can I do nothing--& who come to you with my poor sorrows ? "

    " And make mine so much lighter," she replied. " Dear Trotwood, no ! "

    "Dear Agnes," I said, "it is presumptuous for me, who am so poor
 in all in which you are so rich-goodness, resolation, all noble qualities-
 to doubt or direct you; but you know how much I love you, and how
 much I owe you. You will never sacrifice yourself to a mistaken sense
 of duty, Agnes ? "
    More agitated for a moment than I had ever seen her, she took her
 hand from me, and moved a step back.
    " Say you have no such thought, dear Agnes ! Much more than sister !

 Think of the priceless gift of such a heart as yours, of such a love
as yours ! "
    Oh ! long, long afterwards, I saw that face rise up before me, with its
momentary look, not wondering, not accusing, not regretting. Oh, long,
long afterwards, I saw that look subside, as it did now, into the lovely
smile, with which she told me she had no fear for herself-I need have
none for her-and parted from me by the name of Brother, and was
gone !
   I t was dark in the morning, when I got upon the coach at the inn
door. The day was just breaking when we were about to start, and then,
as I sat thinking of her, came struggling up the coach side, through the
mingled day and night, Uriah's head.
    " Copperfield ! " said he, in a croaking whisper, as he hung by the
iron on the roof, " I thought you'd be glad to hear before you went
off, that there are no squares broke between us. I've been into his room
already, and we 've made it all smooth. Why, though I ' m umble, I ' m
useful to him, you know; and he understands his interest when he isn't
in liquor ! What an agreeable man he is, after all, Master Copperfield !"
   I obliged myself to say that I was glad he had made his apology.
   " Oh, to be sure !" said Uriah. "When a person's umble, you know,
what's an apology ? So easy ! I say ! I suppose," with a jerk, " 71)u
have sometimes plucked a pear before it was ripe, Master Copperfield?
   " I suppose I have," I replied.
   "I did that last night," said Uriah ; "but it 'I1 ripen yet ! I t only
wants attending to. I can wait ! "
   Profuse in his farewells, he got down again as the coachman got up.
For anything I know, he was eating something to keep the raw morning
air out; but, he made motions with his mouth as if the pear were ripe
already, and he were smacking his lips over it.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.




                             CHAPTER XL.
                              THE WANDERER.

    WE had a very serious conversation in Buckingham Street that night,
about the domestic occurrences I have detailed in the last chapter. My
aunt was deeply interested in them, and walked up and down the room
with her arms folded, for more than two hours afterwards. Whenever she
was particularly discomposed, she always performed one of these pedes-
trian feats; and the amount of her discomposure might always be
estimated by the duration of her walk. On this occasion she was so
much disturbed in mind as to find it necessary to open the bed-room
door, and make a course for herself, comprising the full extent of the
bed-rooms from wall to wall; and while Mr. Dick and I sat quietly by
the fire, she kept passing in and out, along this measured track, at an
unchanging pace, with the regularity of a clock-pendulum.
    When my aunt and I were left to ourselves by Mr. Dick's going out to
bed, I sat down to write my letter to the two old ladies. By that time
she was tired of walking, and sat by the fire with her dress tucked up as
usual. But instead of sitting in her usual manner, holding her glass upon
her knee, she suffered it to stand neglected on the chimney-piece; and,
resting her left elbow on her right arm, and her chin on her left hand,
looked thoughtfully at me. As often as I raised my eyes from what
I was about, I met hers. " I am in the lovingest of tempers, my
dear," she would assure me with a nod, " but I am fidgetted and
sorry !"
   I had been too busy to observe, until after she uras gone to bed, that
she had left her night-mixture, as she always called it, untasted on the
 chimney-piece. She came to her door, with even more than her usual
 affection of manner, when I knocked to acquaint her with this discovery;
 but only said, " I have not the heart to take it, Trot, to-night," and shook
 her head, and went in again.
    She read my letter to the two old ladies, in the morning, and approved
 of it. I posted it, and had nothing to do then, but wait, as patiently as
 I could, for the reply. I was still in this state of expectation, and had
 been, for nearly a week; when I left the Doctor's one snowy night, to
walk home.
    I t had been a bitter day, and a cutting north-east wind had blown for
 some time. The wind had gone down with the light, and so the snow
 had come on. I t was a heavy, settled fall, I recollect, in great flakes ; and
it lay thick. The noise of wheels and tread of people were as hushed, as
if the streets had been strewn that depth with feathers.
    My shortest way home,-and I naturally took the shortest way on such
 a night-was     through Saint Martin's Lane. Now, the church which
 gives its name to the lane, stood in a less free situation at that time ;
 there being no open space before it, and the lane winding down to the
412           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

Strand. As I passed the steps of the portico, I encountered, at the
corner, a woman's face. I t looked in mine, passed across the narrow
lane, and disappeared. I knew it. I had seen it somewhere. But I could
not remember where. I had some association with it, that struck upon
my heart directly; but I was thinking of anything else when it came
upon me, and was confused.
     On the steps of the church, there was the stooping figure of a man,
who had put down some burden on the smooth snow, to adjust i t ; my
seeing the face, and my seeing him, were simultaneous. I don't think
I had stopped in my surprise; but, in any case, as I went on, he rose,
turned, and came down towards me. I stood face to face with Mr.
Peggotty !
     Then I remembered the woman. I t was Martha, to whom Emily had
given the money that night in the kitchen. Martha Endell-side by side
with whom, he would not have seen his dear niece, Ham had told me, for
all the treasures wrecked in the sea.
     We shook hands heartily. At first neither of us could speak a word.
     " Rlas'r Davy ! " he said, griping me tight," it do my art good to see

you, sir. Well met, well met ! "
     "Well met, my dear old friend ! " said I.
     " I had my thowts 0' coming to makeinquiration for you, sir, to-night,"
he said, " but knowing as your aunt was living along wi' you-for I've
been down yonder-Yarmouth              way-I was afeerd it was too late. I
should have come early in the morning, sir, afore going away."
     " Again ? " said I.
     ' ' Y ~ S , sir," he replied, patiently shaking his head, " I ' m away
to-morrow."
     " Where were you going now ?" I asked.
     "Well ! " he replied, shaking the snow out of his long hair, " I was
a going to turn in somewheers."
     I n those days there was a side-entrance to the stable-yard of the Golden
Cross, the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his misfortune, nearly
opposite to where we stood. I pointed out the gateway, put my arm
through his, and we went across. Two or three public-rooms opened out
of the stable-yard; and looking into one of them, and finding it empty,
and a good fire burning, I took him in there.
     When I saw him in the light, I observed, not only that his hair was
long and ragged, but that his face was burnt dark by the sun. He was
greyer, the lines in his face and forehead were deeper, and he had every
appearance of having toiled and wandered through all varieties of weather;
but he looked very strong, and like a man upheld by stedfastness of
purpose, whom nothing could tire out. H e shook the snow from his hat
and clothes, and brushed it away from his face, while I was inwardly
making these remarks. As he sate down opposite to me at a table, with
his back to the door by which we had entered, he put out his rough hand
again, and grasped mine warmly.
     " I ' l l tell you, Mas'r Davy," he said,--" wheer all I've been, and
 what-all we 've heerd. I've been fur, and we 've heerd little; but
 I '11 tell you ! "
     I rang the bell for something hot to drink. He would have nothing
 younger than ale ; and while it was being brought, and being warmed at

the fire, he sat thinking. There was a fine, massive gravity in his face, I
did not venture to disturb.
    " When she was a child," he said, lifting up his head soon after we

wereleft alone, " sheused to talk to me a deal about the sea, and about
them coasts where the sea got to be dark blue, and to lay a shining and
 a shining in the sun. I thowt, odd times, as her father being drownded
 made her think on it so much. I doen't know, you see, but maybe she
 believed-or hoped-he had drifted out to them parts, where the flowers
 is always a blowing, and the country bright."
     " I t is likely to have been a childish fancy," I replied.
     " When she was-lost," said Mr. Peggotty, "I know'd in my mind, as
 he would take her to them countries. I know'd in my mind, as he'd
 have told her wonders of 'em, and how she was to be a lady theer, and how
 he got her listen to him first, along o'sech like. When we see his
 mother, I know'd quite well as I was right. I went across-channel to
 Prance, and landed theer, as if I 'd fell down from the sky."
     I saw the door move, and the snow drift in. I saw it move a little
 more, and a hand softly interpose to keep it open.
     " I found out a English gentleman as was in authority," said Mr.
 Peggotty, " and told him I was a going to seek my niece. He got me them
 papers as I wanted fur to carry me through-I doen't rightly know how
 they 're called-and he would have give me money, but that I was thankful
 to have no need on. I thank him kind, for all he done, I 'm sure ! ' I 've
 wrote afore you,' he says to me, 'and I shall speak to many as will come
 that way, and many will know you, fur distant from here, when you 're a
 travelling alone.' I told him, best as I was able, what my gratitoode was,
 and went away through Prance."
     " Alone, and on foot ? " said I.

     " AXostly a-foot," he rejoined ; " sometimes in carts along with people
  going to market ; sometimes in empty coaches. Many mile a day a-foot,
  and often with some poor soldier or another, travelling to see his friends.
  I couldn't talk to him," said Mr. Peggoty, "nor he to me ; but we was
  company for one another, too, along the dusty roads."
     I should have known that by his friendly tone.
     "When I come to any town," he pursued, " I found the inn, and waited
  about the yard till some one turned up (some one mostly did) as know'd
  English. Then I told how that I was on my way to seek my niece, and
  they told me what manner of gentlefolks was in the house, and I waited to
  see any as seemed like her, going in or out. When it warn't Em'ly, I went
  on agen. By little andlittle, when I come to a new village or that, among
  the poor people, I found they know'd about me. They would set me down
  at their cottage doors, and give me what-not fur to eat and drink, and
  show me where to sleep; and many a woman, llas'r Davy, as has had a
  daughter of about Em'ly's age, I've found a-waiting for me, at Our
  Saviour's Cross outside the village, fur to do me sim'lar kindnesses.
  Some has had daughters as was dead. And God only knows how good
  them mothers was to me ! "
     I t was Martha at the door. I saw her haggard, listening face dis-
  tinctly. My dread was lest he should turn his head, and see her too.
      "They would often put their children-partic'lar their little girls,"
  said lb.Peggotty, "upon my knee ; and many a time you might have seen
414           THE PERSONAL HISTORY          AND EXPERIEKCE

me sitting at their doors, when night was coming on, a'most as if they'd
been my Darling's children. Oh, my Darling! "
   Overpowered by sudden grief, he sobbed aloud. I laid my trembling
hand upon the hand he put before his face. " Thankee, sir," he said,
" don't take no notice."
   I n a very little while he took his hand away and put it in his breast,
and went on with his story.
   " They often walked with me," he said, " in the morning, maybe a
mile or two upon my road ; and when we parted, and I said, ' I'm very
thankful to you! God bless you ! ' they always seemed to understand,
and answered pleasant. At last I come to the sea. I t warn't hard, you
may suppose, for a seafaring man like me to work his way over to Italy.
When I got theer, I wandered on as I had done afore. The people was
just as good to me, and I should have gone from town to town, maybe
the country through, but that I got news of her being seen among them
Swiss mountains yonder. One as know'd his servant see 'em there, all
three, and told me how they travelled, and where they was. I made for
them mountains, Mas'r Davy, day and night. Ever so fur as I went, ever
so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me. But I come up with
'em, and I crossed 'em. When I got nigh the place as I had been told of, I
began to think within my own self, 'What shall I do when I see her ? ' "
   The listening face, insensible to the inclement night, still drooped at the
door, and the hands begged me-prayed me-not to cast it forth.
   " I never doubted her," said Mr. Peggotty.         " No ! not a bit ! On'y
let her see my face-on'y       let her heer my voice-on'y let my stanning
still afore her bring to her thoughts the home she had fled away from,
and the child she had been-and if she had growed to be a royal lady, she'd
have fell down at my feet ! I Itnow'd it well ! Many a time in my sleep had
I heerd her cry out, ' Uncle ! ' and seen her fall like death afore me. Many
a time in my sleep had I raised her up, and whispered to her,' Em'ly my
dear, I am come fur to bring forgiveness, and to take you home ! ' "
   He stopped and shook his head, and went on with a sigh.
    "He was nowt to me now. Em'ly was all. I bought a country dress to
put upon her ; and I know'd that, once found, she would walk beside me over
them stony roads, go where I would, and never, never, leave me more. To
put that dress upon her, and to cast off what she wore-to take her on
my arm again, and wander towards home-to stop sometimes upon the
road, and heal her bruised feet and her worse-bruised heart-was all
that I thowt of now. I doen't believe I should have done so much as
look at him. But, Mas'r Davy, it warn't to be-not yet! I was too
late, and they was gone. Wheer, I couldn't learn. Some said heer, some
said theer. I travelled heer, and I travelled theer, but I found no Em'ly,
and I travelled home."
   " How long ago ? " I asked.
   " A matter o' fower days," said Mr. Peggotty. " I sighted the old boat
arter dark, and the light a shining in the winder. When I come nigh and
looked in through the glass, I see the faithful creetur Missis Gummidge
sittin' by the fire, as we had fixed upon, alone. I called out, 'Doen't be
 afeerd! I t ' s Dan'l! ' and I went in. I never could have thowt the
 old boat would have been so strange ! "
    From some pocket in his breast, he took out, with a very careful hand,
                           O F DAVID COPPERFIELD.

a small paper bundle containing two or three letters or little packets, which
he laid upon the table.
   "This first one come," he said, selecting it from the rest, " afore I
had been gone a week. A fifty pound Bank note, in a sheet of paper,
directed to me, and put underneath the door in the night. She tried to
hide her writing, but she couldn't hide it from Me ! "
   He folded up the note again, with great patience and care, in exactly the
same form, and laid it on one side.
   " This come to Missis Gummidge," he said, opening another, " two or

three months ago." After looking at it for some moments, he gave it to
me, and added in a low voice, "Be so good as read it, sir."
   I read as follows :
     " Oh what will you feel when you see this writing, and know it comes from my
  wicked hand ! But try, try-not for my sake, but for uncle's goodness, try to
  let your heart soften to me, only for a little little time ! Try, pray do, to relent
  towards a miserable girl, and write down on a bit of paper whether he is well,
  and what he said about me before you left off ever naming me among yourselves
  -and whether, of a night, when it is my old time of coming home, you ever see
  him look as if he thought of one he used to love so dear. Oh, my heart is breaking
  when I think about it ! I am kneeling down to yon, begging and praying younot
  to be as hard with me as I deserve -as I well, well, know I deserve - but to
  be so gentle and so good, as to write down something of him, and to send it to
  me. You need not call me Little, you need not call me by the name I have dis-
  graced ; but oh, listen to my agony, and have mercy on me so far as to write me
  some word of uncle, never, never to be seen in this world by my eyes again !
     " Dear, if your heart is hard towards me-justly hard, I know-but, Listen, if
  it is hard, dear, ask him I have wronged the most-him whose wife I was to have
  been-before you quite decide against my poor poor prayer ! If he should be so
  compassionate a s to say that yon might write something for me to read-I think
  he would, oh, I think he would, if you would only ask him, for he always was so
  brave and so forgiving-tell him then (but not else), that when I hear the wind
  blowing at night, I feel as if it was passing angrily from seeing him and uncle,
  and was going up to God against me. Tell him that if I was to die to-morrow
  (and oh, if I was fit, I would be so glad to die !) I would bless him and uncle with
  my last words, and pray for his happy home with my last breath !"
   Some money was inclosed in this letter also. Five pounds. I t was
untouched like the previous sum, and he refolded it in the same way.
Detailed instructions were added relative to the address of a reply, which,
although they betrayed the intervention of several hands, and made it
difficult to arrive at any very probable conclusion in reference to her place
of concealment, made it at least not unlikely that she had written from
that spot where she was stated to have been seen.
   "What answer was sent ? " I inquired of Mr. Peggotty.
   " Missis Gummidge," he returned, "not being a good scholar, sir, Ham
kindly drawed it out, and she made a copy on it. They told her I was
gone to seek her, and what my parting words was."
   " I s that another letter in your hand ? " said I.
   " I t ' s money, sir," said Mr. Pe~gotty,unfolding it a little way. " Ten
pound, you see. And wrote inslde, 'Prom a true friend,' like the first.
But the first was put underneath the door, and this come by the post, day
afore yesterday. I 'm a going to seek her at the post-mark."
   He showed it to me. I t was a town on the Upper Rhine. H e had
416            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  found out, at Yarmouth, some foreign dealers who knew that country, and
  they had drawn him a rude map on paper, which he could very well under-
  stand. He laid it between us on the table ; and, with his chin resting
  on one hand, tracked his course upon it with the other.
     I asked him how Ham was? He shook his head.
     "He works," he said, " as bold as a man can. His name's as good, in
  all that part, as any man's is, anywheres in the wureld. Anyone's hand is
 ready to help him, you understand, and his is ready to help them. He's
 never been heerd fur to complain. But my sister's belief is ('twixt ourselves)
  as it has cut him deep."
     " Poor fellow, I can believe it ! "
     " H e ain't no care, Mas'r Davy," said Mr. Peggotty in a solemn whisper

 -" keinder no care no-how for his life. When a man's wanted for rough
  service in rough weather, he's theer. When there 's hard duty to be
 done with danger in it, he steps forward afore all his mates. And yet he 's
 as gentle as any child. There ain't a child in Yarmouth that doen't know
 him."
     He gathered up the letters thoughtfully, smoothing them with his hand;
 put them into their little bundle; and placed it tenderly in his breast
 again. The face was gone from the door. I still saw the snow drifting
 in ; but nothing else was there.
     " Well ! " he said, looking to his bag, " having seen you to-night, Mas'r
 Davy (and that doos me good!) I shall away betimes to-morrow morn-
ing. You have seen what I've got heer;" putting his hand on where
 the little packet lay ; "all that troubles me is, to think that any harm might
 come to me, afore that money was give back. If I was to die, and it was
lost, or stole, or elseways made away with, and it was never knowed
by him but what I ' d took it, I believe the t'other wureld wouldn't hold
 me ! I believe I must come back! "
     He rose, and I rose too; we grasped each other by the hand again,
 before going out.
     " I ' d go ten thousand mile," he said, " I ' d go till I dropped dead, to

lay that money down afore him. If I do that, and find my Em'ly, I ' m
content. If I doen't find her, maybe she '11 come to hear, sometime, as her
loving uncle only ended his search for her when he ended his life; and if
I know her, even that will turn her home at last ! "
    As we went out into the rigorous night, I saw the lonely figure flit
away before us. I turned him hastily on some pretence, and held him in
conversation until it was gone.
    He spoke of a traveller's house on the Dover road, where he knew he
could find a clean, plain lodging for the night. I went with him over
Westminster Bridge, and parted from him on the Surrey shore. Every-
thing seemed, to my imagination, to be hushed in reverence for him, as
he resumed his solitary journey through the snow.
    I returned to the inn yard, and, impressed by my remembrance of the
face, looked awfully around for it. I t was not there. The snow had
covered our late footprints ; my new track was the only one to be seen;
and even that began to die away (it snowed so fast) as I looked back over
my shoulder.

               MESSRS. N I C O L L ' S W A R E R O O M S ,
       Through the purchase of adjoining premises, now extend over a space hitherto occupied by four
       large Establishments, viz., 114, 116, 118, and 120, REGENT STREET, thus forming, with their
       several suites of Show Rooms on the First Floor, not only the largest, but also the most elegant,
       Magazine for Gentlemen's Clothing to be met with in Europe.
          The Entrance to the WHOLESALE AND SHIPPING DEPAlETMENTS, for the sale
       of Woollen Cloths, &c., will, for the f~iture,be in Warwick-street, No.41 (immediately at the
       rear of the Retail Warerooms in Regentstreet), where the counting-house is also placed, and to
       which address all applications for agencies, &c., are referred, as also those who may desire inter-
      views with the Principals, or Heads of Departments ; but Manufacturers, or others, having
      novelties to submit to the above firm, are requested to make an appointment by writing.
         Those who are desirous of becoming Messrs. NICOLL'S Agents for the sale of their Patented
      and other Goods, in such towns of the United Kingdom or Colonies, where Messrs. N. are at
      present uurepresented, are informed that the Goods in question may be sold by them at the same
      price as they are retailed in Regent-street ; at the same time affording to the Agent a better
      profit than if attempts be made to copy, or otherwise pirate, the several articles.
         Merchants, Shippers, and others, will find the class of goods sold by Messrs. NICOLL
      peculiarly well adapted, through their excellence of quality and finish, for the wants of the now
      numerous respectable residents in the Colonies, as the Goods are such as are required by the
      wealthy and middle classes of the Mother Country. Indeed, a safer or niore profitable venture
      cannot be made by Shippers, seeing that the Market has been hitherto almost exclusively supplied
      with garments calculated, in material and appearance, for the use of labourers, &c., only.

      THE NlCOLL PALETOT, OR PATENT COAT,
      As also the original Invention, the REGISTERED PALETOT (6 and 7 Vic., Cap. 65), and
      NICOLL'S MORSING COAT, adapted for Spring and Summer Wear, and, notwithstanding all
      the recent Improvements, making these Garments not only the most Gentlemanly, but also the
      most durable and inexpensive articles of Dress extant, the prices for the above seasons will yet
      remain at ONE and TWO GUINEAS each.
                        114,116, 118,120, REGENT STREET, and 22, Cornhill.

                                114, R E G E N T S T R E E T .
        The above will, as heretofore, form the principal entrance to NICOLL'S PALETOT WARE-
      ROOMS, as also where Gentlemen are respectfully invited to inspect all the NOVELTIES, a s
      well as all the established articles of Costume, that capital can collect, or skill can form.

                                116, R E G E N T S T R E E T .
        Much ingenuity of design may be here witnessed in Embroidered and other materials intended
      for WAISTCOATS, in WEDDING, BALL, or MORNING WEAR, all moderate in cost.
        UNIFORMS, either DIPLOMATIC, NAVAL, or MILITARY, are produced at fair prices.
      Clever and efficient persons are employed by Messrs. NICOLL to attend to each department.

                                118, R E G E N T S T R E E T .
        ROBES, whether intended for the PEER, the CLERGYMAN, the BARRISTER, or YOUTH
      AT COLLEGE, may be here obtained at the same moderate scale of prices as have served t o
      distinguish NICOLL'S PALETOT.

      an adjunct to Messrs. NICOLL'S Trade, but, increased space now affording the convenience, the

      same moderate prices and excellence will be here developed, as may be observed in the
      Paletot, &c.
        Parents and Guardians are respcctfully invited to inspect the cost of the COLLEGE CAP and
 1    GOWN, with all other Items necessary for the Universities, Public and Private Schools, &c.

 I      This is the address of Messrs. NICOLL'S CITY ESTABLISHMENT, where the PALETOT,
      with Materials and skill, a$ in Regent-street, are submitted for inspection and use.
        Many of late have used the word "Paletot," but H. J. and D. NlCOLL are the Sole Proprietors

   r'Tlie Horse Guards proves to be a work written evidently by an officer, and which contains a vast amount of
practical knowledge, sound sense, and truisms not edsily refuted. Severe and satirical in its tone. elegant and
terse in its arrangement; and profoundly convincing in the arguments, based upon correct data.' No military
man can arise from a perusal without acknowledging that in this volume he has found a graphic detail of the
grievances of the profession, and a just animadversion upon the many wrongs perpetrated upon officers.
The book itself must be purchased by subalterns a s well as general oficers, and carefully read."-British Avmy

   '*' The Two Mounted Sentries' is the taking title of a capital satire upon the mismanagement of the Horse
 Guards. I t embraces a wide field of commentary upon all the existing army abuses. We hope t o have a

A Monthly Supplement to " Household Words,"
                        CONDUCTED BY

        CHARLES DICKENS.

W E t a b this opportunity of announcing a design closely
     associated with our Household Words, which we have now
matured, and which we hope will be acceptable to our readers.
   W e propose publishing, at the end of each month, as a Sup-
plementary Number to the monthly part of Household Words,
a comprehensive Abstract or History of all the occurrences of
that month, native and foreign, under the title of THE HOUSE-
HOLD NARRATIVE     OF CURRENT   EVENTS.
   The size and price of each of these numbers will be the same
as the size and price of a single number of "HOUSEHOLD
WORDS." Twelve numbers will necessarily be published in
the course of the year-one for each month-and on the com-
pletion of the Annual Volume, a copious Index will appear,
and a title-page for the volume; which will then be called THE
HOUSEHOLD     NARRATIVE   of such a year. I t will form a complete
Chronicle of all that year's events, carefully compiled, thoroughly
digested, and systematically arranged for easy reference ; pre-
senting a vast mass of information that must be interesting to
all, at a price that will render i t accessible to the humblest pur-
chasers of books, arid at which only our existing machinery in
 4              THE HOUSEHOLD NARRATIVE.

 connexion with our Weekly Miscellany would enable us to
 produce it.
    The first number of THE HOUSEHOLD       NARRATIVE   will appear
 as a Supplement to the first monthly part of "Household
 Words," published at the end of the present month of APRIL.
 As the Volume for 1850 would be incomplete (in consequence
 of our not having commenced this publication at the beginning
of a year) without a backward reference to the three months of
 JANUARY,   FEBRUARY,   and MARCH,a similar number of THE
 HOUSEHOLD    NARRATIVE   for each of those months will be pub-
lished before the year is out.
   I t is scarcely necessary to explain that it is not proposed to
render the purchase of THE HOUSEHOLD        NARRATIVE  compulsory
on the purchasers of Household Words ; and that the Supple-
mentary Number, though always published at the same time as
our Monthly Part, will therefore be detached from it, and
published separately.
   Nor is i t necessary for us, we believe, to expatiate on our
leading reasons for adding this new undertaking to our present
enterprise. The intimate connexion between the facts and
realities of the time, and the means by which we aim, in
"HOUSEHOLD WORDS," to soften what is hard in them, to
exalt what is held in little consideration, and to show the latent
hope there is in what may seem unpromising, needs not to be
pointed out. All that we sought to express in our Preliminary
Word, in reference to this work, applies, we think, to its pro-
posed companion. As another humble means of enabling those
who accept us for their friend, to bear the world's rough-cast
events to the anvil of courageous duty, and there beat them into
a shape, we enter on the project, and confide in its success.

                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.




                              CHAPTER XLI.


   AT last, an answer came from the two old ladies. They presented
their compliments to Mr. Copperfield, and informed him that they had given
his letter their best consideration, "with a view to the happiness of both
parties "-which I thought rather an alarming expression, not only because
of the use they had made of it in relation to the family difference before-
mentioned, but because I had (and have all my life) observed that conven-
tional phrases are a sort of fireworks, easily let off, and liable to take a great
variety of shapes and colors not at all suggested by their original form. The
Misses Spenlow added that they begged to forbear expressing, "through
the medium of correspondence," an opinion on the subject of Mr. Cop-
perfiela's communication ; but that if Mr. Copperfield would do them the
favor to call, upon a certain day, (accompanied, if he thought proper, by
a confidential friend), they would be happy to hold some conversation on
the subject.
   To this favor, Mr. Copperfield immediately replied, with his respectful
compliments, that he would have the honor of waiting on the Misses
Spenlow, at the time appointed; accompanied, in accordance with their
kind permission, by his friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple.
13aving dispatched which missive, Mr. Copperfield fell into a condition of
strong nervous agitation ; and so remained until the day arrived.
   It was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved, at this
eventful crisis, of the inestimable services of Miss Mills. But Mr. Mills,
who was always doing something or other to annoy me-or I felt as if he
were, which was the same thing-had brought his conduct to a climax,
by taking it into his head that he would go to India. Why should he go
to India, except to harass me? To be sure he had nothing to do with
any other part of the world, and had a good deal to do with that part;
being entirely in the India trade, whatever that was (I had floating
dreams myself concerning golden shawls and elephant's teeth) ; having
been at Cdcutta in his youth; and designing now to go out there
again, in the capacity of resident partner. But this was nothing to me.
However, it was so much to him that for India he was bound, and
Julia with him; and Julia went into the country to take leave of her
relations ; and the house .was pnt into a perfect suit of bills, announcing
that it was to be let or sold, and that the furniture (Mangle and all) was
to be taken at a valuation. So, here was another earthquake of which I
became the sport, before I had recovered from the shock of its predecessor !
   I was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day;
being divided between my desire to appear to advantage, and my appre-
hensions of putting on anything that might impair my severely practical
character in the eyes of the Misses Spenlow. I endeavoured to hit a
happy medium between these two extremes ; my aunt approved the result ;
                                                                 E E
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

and Mr. Dick threw one of his shoes after Traddles and me, for luck, as
we went down-stairs.
   Excellent fellow as I knew Traddles to be, and warmly attached to him
as I was, I could not help wishing, on that delicate occasion, that he had
never contracted the habit of brushi~lghis hair so very upright. I t gave
him a surprised look-not       to say a hearth-broomy kind of expression
-which, my apprehensions whispered, might be fatal to us.
   I took the liberty of mentioning it to Traddles, as we were walking
to Putney ; and saying that if he would smooth it down a little-
   " My dear Copperfield," said Traddles, lifting off his hat, and rubbing
his hair all kinds of ways, "nothing would give me greater pleasure. But
it won't."
   "Won't be smoothed down? " said I.
   "No," said Traddles. " Nothing will induce it. If I was to carry a
half-hundred-weight upon it, all the way to Putney, it would be up again
the moment the weight was taken off. You have no idea what obstinate
hair mine is, Copperfield. I am quite a fretful porcupine."
   I was a little disappointed, I must confess, but thoroughly charmed by
his good-nature too. I told him how I esteemed his good-nature; and
said that his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character,
for he had none.
   " Oh! " returned Traddles, laughing, "I assure you, it's quite an old
story, my unfortunate hair. My uncle's wife couldn't bear it. She said
it exasperated her. It stood very much in my way, too, when I first fell
in love with Sopliy. Very much ! "
   "Did she object to it ? "
   " She didn't," rejoined Traddles ; " but her eldest sister-the one that 's
the Beauty-quite made game of it, I understand. I n fact, all the sisters
laugh at it."
   "Agreeable ! " said I.
    "Yes," returned Traddles with perfect innocence, "it 's a joke for
us. They pretend that Sophy has a lock of it in her desk, and is obliged
to shut it in a clasped book, to keep it down. We laugh about it."
   " By-the-bye, my dear 'Traddles," said I, "your experience may suggest

something to me. When you became engaged to the young lady whom
you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family ?
Was there anything like-what we are going through to-day, for instance ? "
I added, nervously.
   "Why," replied Traddles, on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade
had stolen, " i t was rather a painful transaction, Copperfield, in my case.
You see, Sophy being of so much use in the family, none of them could
endure the thought of her ever being married. Indeed, they had quite
settled among tliernselves that she never was to be married, and they
called her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, with the
greatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler-"
   " The mamma? "said I.

   " The mamma,"      said Traddles-" Reverend Horace Crewler-when I
mentioned it with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect
upon her was such that she gave a scream and became insensible. I
couldn't approach the subject again, for months."

    "You did at last? " said I.
    " Well, the Reverend Horace did," said Traddles. " He is an excellent
man, most exemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she
ought, as a Christian, to reconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it
was so uncertain), and to bear no uncliaritable feeling towards me. As
to myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey
towards the family."
    "The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?"
    "Why, I can't say they did," he returned. "When we had compara-
tively reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You
recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter
with her spine ? "
    " Perfectly ! "

    " She clenched both her hands," said Traddles, looking at me in
dismay ; " shut her eyes ; turned lead-color ; became perfectly stiff; and
took nothing for two days, but toast-and-water administered with a
teaspoon."
    "What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles ! " I remarked.
    " Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield ! " said Traddles.        " She is a
 very charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling. I11 fact, they all
have. Sophy told me afterwards, that the self-reproach she underwent
 while shc was in attendance upon Sarah, no words could describe. I
 know it must have been severe, by my own feelings, Copperfield; which
 were like a criminal's. dfter Sarah was restored, we still had to break it
to the other eight; and it produced various effects upon them of a most
pathetic nature. The two little ones, whom Soplly educates, have only
just left off de-testing me."
    " At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope? " said I.

    " Ye-yes, I should say they were, on the whole, resigned to it," said
Traddles, doubtfully. "The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject ;
and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great con-
solation to them. There will be a deplorable scene, whenever we are
married. I t will be much more like a funeral, than a wedding. And
they '11 all hate me for taking her away! "
    His honest face, as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his head,
impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality, for I
was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation and wandering of
mind, as to be quite unable to fix my attention on anything. On our
approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived, I was at such a
discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of mind, that
Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass of ale. This
having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, he conducted
me, with tottering steps, to the hlisses Spenlow's door.
    I had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid
opened it ; and of wavering, sotnehow, across a hall with a weather-glass in
it, into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding a neat
garden. Also of sitting down here, on a sofa, and seeing Traddles's hair
 start up, now his hat was removed, l ~ k eone of those obtrusive little
 figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitious snuff-boxes when the lid
 is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned clock ticking away on the
                                                            E E 2
420           THE PERSONAL I-IISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time to the jerking of my
heart,-which it wouldn't. Also of looking round the room for any sign
of Dora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that Jip once barked in the
distance, and was instantly choked by somebody. Ultimately I found
myself backing Traddles into the fire-place, and bowing in great confusion
to two dry little elderly ladies, dressed in black, and each looking wonder-
fully like a preparation in chip or tan of the late Mr. Spenlolv.
   '' Pray," said one of the two little ladies, "be seated."
   When I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something
which was not a cat-my first seat was-I so far recovered my sight, as
to perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the
family; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the two
sisters; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the con-
ference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand-so familiar as it
looked to me, and yet so odd!-and was referring to it through an eye-
glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress with a more
youthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more frill, or tucker,
or brooch, or bracelet, or some little thing of that kind, which made her
look more lively. They were both upright in their carriage, formal, pre-
cise, composed, and quiet. The sister who had not my letter, had her
arms crossed on her breast, and resting on each other, like an Idol.
   c' Mr. Copperfield, I believe," said the sister who had got my letter,
addressing herself to Traddles.
   This was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was
Mr. Copperfield, and I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest
themselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield,
and altogether we were in a nice condition. To improve it, we all distinctly
heard Jip give two short barks, and receive another choke.
   " Mr. Copperfield ! " said the sister with the letter.
   I did something-bowed, I suppose-and was d l attention, when the
other sister struck in.
   " My sister Lavinia," said she, "being conversant with matters of this

nature, will state what we consider most calculated to promote the happi-
ness of both parties."
   I discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an anthority in affairs
of the heart, by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr.
Pidger, who played short whist, and was supposed to have been enamoured
of her. My private opinion is, that this was entirely a gratuitous assump-
tion, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such sentiments-to
which he had never given any sort of expression that I could ever hear of.
Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissn had a superstition, however, that
he would have declared his passion, if he had not been cut short in
his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking his constitution, and over-
doing an attempt to set it right again by swilling Bath water. They
had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of secret love ; though I must
say there was a picture of him in the house with a damask nose, which
concealment did not appear to have ever preyed upon.
   "We will not," said Miss Lavinia, "enter on the past history of this
matter. Our poor brother Francis's death has cancelled that."
   "We had not," said Miss Clarissa, "been in the habit of frequent
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           421
association with our brother Francis ;but there was no decided division or
disunion between us. Francis took his road ; we took ours. We consi-
dered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should be so.
And it was SO."
   Each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak, shook her head after
speaking, and became upright again when silent. Miss Clarissa never
moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon them with her fingers
-minuets and marches I should think-but never moved them.
   " Our niece's position, or supposed position, is much changed by our

brother Francis's death," said Miss Lavinia ; "and therefore we consider
our brother's opinions as regarded her position as being changed too. We
have no reason to doubt, Mr. Copperfield, that you are a young gentleman
possessed of good qualities and honorable character ; or that you have an
affection-or are fully persuaded that you have an affection-for our niece."
   I replied, as I usually did whenever I had a chance, that nobody had
ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance
with a confirmatory murmur.
   Xiss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder, when Miss Clarissa,
who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother
Prancis, struck in again :
   "If Dora's mamma," she said, "when she married our brother
Francis, had at once said that there was not room for the family at the
dinner-table, it would have been better for the happiness of all parties."
   " Sister Clarissa," said Miss Lavinia. " Perhaps we needn't mind
that now."
   " Sister Lavinia,"    said Miss Clarissa, "it belongs to the subject.
With your branch of the subject, on which alone you are competent to
speak, I should not think of interfering. On this branch of the subject I
have a voice and an opinion. It would have been better for the happiness
of all parties, if Dora's mamma, when she married our brother Prancis,
had mentioned plainly what her intentions were. We should then have
known what we had to expect. We should have said 'pray do not invite
us, at any time ;' and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been
avoided."
   When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed:
again referring to my letter through her eye-glass. They both had little
bright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds' eyes.
They were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden
manner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like canaries.
   Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed :
   " You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield,
to visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece."
   " If our brother Francis," said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again,
if I may call anything so calm a breaking out, "wished to surround
himself with an atmosphere of Doctors' Commons, and of Doctors'
Commons only, what right or desire had nre lo object ? None, I am sure.
We have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on any one.
But why not say so? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their
society. Let my sister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can
find it for ourselves, I hope ! "
422            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles aiid me, both Traddles and
I made some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed,
myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don't in the
least know what I meant.
    " Sister Lavinia," said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind,

" you can go on, my dear."

    Miss Lavinia proceeded :
    " Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful
indeed in considering this letter ; aiid we hale not considered it without
finally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We have
no doubt that you think you like her very much."
    " Think, ma'am," I rapturonsly began, " oh !-"

    But Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as
requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon.
    " Affection," said Miss Zavinia, glancing at her sister for corroboration,
which she gave in the form of a little nod to every clause, " mature
affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express itself. Its voice is
low. I t is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush, waits and waits.
Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away, and finds it still
ripening in the shade."
    Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her
supposed experience of the stricken Pidger ; but I saw, from the gravity
 with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached
to these words.
    "The light-for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the
 light-inclinations of very young people," pursued Miss Lavinia, " are
 dust, compared to rocks. I t is owing to the difficulty of knowing
 whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation, that my
 sister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act,
 Mr. Copperfield, and Mr. --"
    " Traddles," said my friend, fillding himself looked at.

    " I beg pardon. Of the Inner Temple, I believe ? ;' said Miss Clarissa,
 again glancing at my letter.
    Traddles said, " Exactly so," and became pretty red in the face.
    Now, although I had not received any express encouragement as yet, I
 fancied that I saw in the two little sisters, and particularly in Miss Lavinia,
 an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of domestic
interest, a settling down to make the most of it, a disposition to pet it, in
which there was a good bright ray of hope. I thought I perceived that
Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in superintending two
young lovers, like Dora and me; and that Miss Clarissa would have
hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend us, and in chiming
in with her own particular department of the subject whenever that
impulse was strong upon her. This gave me courage to protest
most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or any
one believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt,
Agnes, Traddles, every one who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how
earriest my love had made me. For the truth of this, I appealed to
Traddles. And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a
Parliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly : confirming me in good
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIE1,D.                            423
round terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently made
a favorable impression.
    " I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little

experience of such things," said Traddles, " being myself engaged to a
young lady-one of ten, dowri in Devorishire-and seeing no probability,
at present, of our engagement coming to a termination."
    " You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,"

observed Miss Lavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, " of the
affection that is modest and retiring ; that waits and waits ? "
    " Entirely, ma'am,"    said Traddles.
    Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely.
Miss Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh.
    " Sister Lavinia," said Miss Clarissa, " take my smelling-bottle."

    Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic vinegar-
Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while ; and then went
on to say, rather faintly:
    " My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what

course we ought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary likings,
of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield, and our niece."
    " Our brother Francis's child," remarked Miss Clarissa. " If our brother

Francis's wife had found it convenient in her life-time (though she had an
unquestionable right to act as she thought best) to invite the family to
her dinner-table, we might have known our brother Francis's child bctter
at the present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed."
    Miss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards
herself, and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking notes
she had made on that part of it.
    " I t seems to us," said she, " prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these feel-

ings to the test of our own observation. At present we know nothing of
them, and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there may be
in them. Therefore wc are inclined so far to accede to Mr. Copperfield's
proposal, as to admit his visits here."
    " I shall never, dear ladies," I exclaimed, relieved of an immense load

of apprehension, " forget your kindness ! "
    "But," pursued Miss Lavinia,-" but, we would prefer to regard those
visits, Mr. Traddles, as made, at present, to us. We must guard ourselves
from reeognising any positive engagement between Mr. Copperfield and
 our niece, until we have had an opportunity-"
    " Until you have had an opportunity, sister Lavinia," said Miss Clarissa.
    " Be it so," assented Miss Lavinia, with a sigh,-"       until I have had an
opportunity of observing them."
    " Copperfield," said Traddles, turning to me, "you feel, I am sure, that
nothing could be more reasonable or considerate."
    " Nothing ! " cried I.    " I am deeply sensible of it."
    " I n this position of affairs," said Miss Lavinia, again referring to her

 notes, "and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we must
 require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assnrance, on 111s word of honor,
 that no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our
 niece without our knowledge. That no project whatever shall be enter-
 tained with regard to our niece, without being first submitted to us -"
424            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " To you, sister Lavinia," Miss Clarissa interposed.
    "Be it so, Clarissa ! " assented Miss Lavinia resignedly-" to me-and
receiving our concurrence. We must make this a most express and serious
 stipulation, not to be broken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield
 to be accompanied by some confidential friend to-day," with an inclination
of her head towards Traddles, who bowed, "in order that there might
be no doubt or misconception on this subject. If Mr. Copperfield, or if
you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving this promise, I beg you
to take time to consider it."
    I exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervor, that not a moment's
consideration could be necessary. I bound myself by the required promise,
in a most impassioned manner ; called upon Traddles to witness it ; and
denounced myself as the most atrocious of cllaracters if I ever swerved
from it in the least degree.
    " Stay ! " said Miss Lavinia, l~oldingup her hand ; " we resolved, before
we had the pleasure of receiving you two gentlemen, to leave you alone for
a quarter of an hour, to consider this point. You will allow us to retire."
    It was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary. They
persisted in withdrawing for the specified .time. Accordingly, these little
birds hopped out with great dignity; leaving me to receive the congra-
tulations of Traddles, and to feel as if I were translated to regions of
exquisite happiness. Exactly at the expiration of the quarter of an hour,
they reappeared with no less dignity than they had disappeared. They
had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumn-
leaves : and they came rustling back, in like manner.
    I then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions.
    " Sister Clarissa," said Miss Lavinia, "the rest is with you."
    Miss Clarissa, unfolding her arms for the first time, took the notes and
glanced at them.
    " We shall be happy," said Miss Clarissa, "to see Mr. Copperfield to
dinner, every Sunday, if it should suit his convenience. Our hour is three."
    1bowed.
    " I n the course of the week," said Miss Clarissa, "we shall be happy

to see Mr. Copperfield to tea. Our hour is half-past six."
    I bowed again.
    "Twice in the week," said Miss Clarissa, "but, as a rule, not oftener."
    I bowed again.
    " Miss Trotwood," said Miss Clarissa, "mentioned in Mr. Copperficld's

letter, will perhaps call upon us. When visiting is better for the happiness
of all parties, we are glad to receive visits, and return them. When it is
better for the l~appinessof all parties that no visiting should take place, (as
in the case of our brother Francis, and his establishment) that is quite
different."
    I intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their
acquaintance ; though I must say I was not quite sure of their getting on
very satisfactorily together. Tlie conditions being now closed, 1 ex-
pressed my acknowledgments in the warmest manner; and, taking the
hand, first of Miss Clarissa, and then of Miss Lavinia, pressed it, in each
case, to my lips.
    Miss Lavinia then arose, and begging Mr. Traddles to excuse us for a
                        OF DAVID COPPERFLELD.                           425
 minute, requested me to follow her. I obeyed, all in a tremble, and was
 conducted into another room. There, I found my blessed darling stopping
her ears behind the door, with her dear little face against the wall ; and
 Jip in the plate-warmer with his head tied up in a towel.
    Oh ! How beautiful she was in her black frock, and how she sobbed
 and cried at first, and wouldn't come out from behind the door ! How
 fond we were of one another, when she did come out at last ; and what
 a state of bliss I was in, when we took Jip out of the plate-warmer, and
 restored him to the light, sneezing very much, and were all three reunited !
     " My dearest Dora ! Now, indeed, my own for ever ! "
     " Oh DON'T ! " pleaded Dora.    " Please ! "

    "Are you not my own for ever, Dora?"
    " Oh yes, of course I am ! " cried Dora, " but I am so frightened !"

     " Frightened, my own ? "

    " Oh yes ! I don't like him," said Dora.     "Why don't he go ? "
    " Who, my life ? "
    "Your friend," said Dora. " I t isn't any business of his. What a
 stupid he must be ! "
    " My love ! " (There never was anything so coaxing as her childish
 ways.) " He is the best creature ! '"
    " Oh, but we don't want any best creatures ! " pouted Dora.

    "My dear," I argued, "you will soon know him well, and like him of
 all things. And here is my aunt coming soon; and you '11 like her of all
things too, when you know her."
    " No, please don't bring her ! " said Dora, giving me a horrified little
kiss, and folding her hands. "Don't. I know she 's a naughty, mischief-
making old thing! Don't let her come here, Doady! " which mas a
corruption of David.
    Remonstrance was of no use, then ; so I laughed, and admired, and was
very much in love and very happy; and she showed me Jip's new trick of
standing on his hind legs in a corner-which he did for about the space
of a flash of lightning, and then fell down-and I don't know how long I
should have stayed there, oblivious of Traddles, if Miss Lavinia had not
come in to take me away. Miss Lavinia was very fond of Dora (she told
me Dora was exactly like what she had been herself at her age- she must
have altered a good deal), and she treated Dora just as if she had been a
toy. I wanted to persuade Dora to come and see Traddles, but on my
proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in; so I went
to Traddles without her, and walked away with him on air.
    "Nothing could be more satisfactory," said Traddles ; " and they are
very agreeable old ladies, I am sure. I shouldn't be at all surprised if
yon were to be married years before me, Copperfield."
    " Does your Sophy play on any instrument, Traddles? " I enquired, in

the pride of my heart.
    " She knows enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters," said

Traddles.
    " Does she sing at all ? " I asked.

    "Why, she sings ballads, sometimes, to freshen up the others a little
when they 're out of spirits," said Traddles. " Nothing scientific."
   " She doesn't sing to the guitar? " said I.
426           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  " Oh dear no ! " said Traddles.
  " Paint at all? "
   " Not at all," said Traddles.
   I promised Traddles that he should hear Dora sing, and see some of
her flower-painting. H e said he should like it very much, and we went
home arm in arm in great good humour and delight. I encouraged him to
talk about Sophy, on the way; which he did with a loving reliance on her
that I very much admired. I compared her in my mind with Dora, with
considerable inward satisfaction; but I candidly admitted to myself that
she seemed to be an excellent kind of girl for Traddles, too.
   Of course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful
issue of the conference, and with all that had been said and done in the
course of it. She was happy to see me so happy, and promised to call
on Dora's aunts without loss of time. But she took such a long walk up
and down our rooms that night, while I was writing to Agnes, that I began
to think she meant to walk till morning.
   My letter to Agnes was a fervent and grateful one, narrating all the
good effects that had resulted from my following her advice. She wrote,
by return of post, to me. Her letter was hopeful, earnest, and cheerful.
She was always cheerful from that time.
   I had my hands more full than ever, now. My daily journies to High-
gate considered, Putney was a long way off; and I naturally wanted to go
there as often as I could. The proposed tea-drinkings being quite
impracticable, I compounded with Miss Lavinia for permission to visit
every Saturday afternoon, without detriment to my privileged Sundays.
90, the close of every week was a delicious time for me; and I got through
the rest of the week by looking forward to it.
   I was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and Dora's aunts
rubbed on, all things considered, much more smoothly than I could have
expected. My aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the
conference; and within a few more days, Dora's aunts called upon
her, in due state and form. Similar but more friendly exchanges took
place afterwards, usually at intervals of three or four weeks. I know that
my aunt distressed Dora's aunts very much, by utterly setting at naught
the dignity of fly-conveyance, and walking out to Putney at extraordinary
times, as shortly after breakfast or just before tea; liltewise by wearing
her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her head,
without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilisation on that subject.
But Dora's aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and
somewhat masculine lady, with a strong understanding; and although my
aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora's aunts, by expressing
heretical opinions on various points of ceremony, she loved me too well
not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony.
   The only member of our small society, who positively refused to adapt
himself to circumstances, was Jip. H e never saw my aunt without
immediately displaying every tooth in his head, retiring under a chair, and
growling incessantly: with now and then a doleful bowl, as if she really
were too much for his feelings. All kinds of treatment were tried with
him, coaxing, scolding, slapping, bringing him to Buckingham Street
(where he instantly dashed at the two cats, to the terror of all beholders) ;
                        OF DAVID COPPERPIELD.                           427
but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunt's society. H e
would sometimes think he had got the better of his objection, and be
amiable for a few minutes ; and then would put up his snub nose, and
howl to that extent, that there was nothing for it but to blind him and
put him in the plate-warmer. At length, Dora regularly muffled him
in a towel and shut him up there, whenever my aunt was reported at
the door.
    One thing troubled me much, after we had fallen into this quiet train.
I t was, that Dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy
or plaything. My aunt, with whom she gradually became familiar,
always called her Little Blossom; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia's life
was to wait upon her, curl her hair, make ornaments for her, and treat
her like a pet child. What Miss Lavinia did, her sister did as a matter of
course. It was very odd to me ; but they all seemed to treat Dora, in her
degree, much as Dora treated Jip in his.
    I made up my mind to speak to Dora about this; and one day when
we were out walking (for we were licensed by Miss Lavinia, after a while,
to go out walking by ourselves), 1said to her that I wished she could get
them to behave towards her differently.
    " Because you know, my darling," I remonstrated, " you are not

a child."
    <' There ! " said Dora. " Now you 're going to be cross ! "
    " Cross, my love ? "

    " I am sure they 're very kind to me," said Dora, " and I am very

happy."
    <' Well ! But my dearest life ! " said I, " you might be very happy, and
yet be treated rationally."
    Dora gave me a reproachful look-the prettiest look !-and then began
to sob, saying if I didn't like her, why had I ever wanted so much to be
engaged to her? And why didn't I go away, now, if I couldn't
bear her ?
    What could I do, but kiss away her tears, and tell her how I doted
on her, after that !
    c r I am sure I am very affectionate," said Dora; " you oughtn't to
be cruel to me, Doady ! "
    " Cruel, my precious love ! As if I would-or     could-be cruel to you,
for the world ! "
    " Then don't find fault with me," said Dora, making a rosebud of her
mouth ; " and I '11 be good."
    I was charmed by her presently asking me, of her own accord, to give
her that cookery-book I had once spoken of, and to show her how to
keep accounts as I had once promised I would. I brought the volume with
me on my next visit (I got it prettily bound, first, to make it look less dry
and more inviting) ; and as we strolled about the Common, I showed hey
an old housekeeping-book of my aunt's, and gave her a set of tablets,
and a pretty little pencil case and box of leads, to practise house-
keeping with.
    But the cookery-book made Dora's head ache, and the figures made
her cry. They wouldn't add up, she said. So she rubbed them out, and
drew little nosegays, and likenesses of me and Jip, d l over the tablets.
              THE PERSON&       HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters, as we
 walked about on a Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, for example, when
we passed a butcher's shop, I would say:
   " Now suppose, my pet, that we were married, and you were going to

buy a shoulder of mutton for dinner, would you know how to buy i t ? "
   My pretty little Dora's face would fall, and she would make her mouth
into a bud again, as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with
a kiss.
   " Would you know how to buy it, my darling?" I would repeat,
perhaps, if I were very inflexible.
   Dora would think a little, and then reply, perhaps, with great triumph :
   " Why, the butcher would know how to sell it, and what need I know?

Oh, you silly boy! "
   So, when I once asked Dora, with an eye to the cookery-book, what she
would do, if we were married, and I were to say I should like a nice Irish
stew, she replied that she would tell the servant to make i t ; and then
clapped her little hands together across my arm, and laughed in such a
charming manner that she was more delightful than ever.
   Consequently, the principal use to which the cookery-book was
devoted, was being put down in the corner for Jip to stand upon. But
Dora was so pleased, when she had trained him to stand upon it without
offering to come oE, and at the same time to hold the pencil case in his
mouth, that I was very glad I had bought it.
   And we fell back on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the songs
about never leaving off dancing, Ta ra la ! and were as happy as the week
was long. I occasionally wished I could venture to hint to Miss Lavinia,
that she treated the darling of my heart a little too much like a plaything ;
and I sometimes awoke, as it were, wondering to find that I had fallen into
the general fault, and treated her like a plaything too-but not often.




                          CHAPTER SLII.
                                DfISCHIEF.

   I FEEL as if it were not for me to record, even though this manuscript
is intended for no eyes but mine, how hard I worked at that tremendous
short-hand, and all improvement appertaining to it, in my sense of
responsibility to Dora and her aunts. I will only add, to what I have
already written of my perseverance at this time of my life, and of a
patient and continuous energy which then began to be matured within
me, and which I know to be the strong part of my character, if it have
any strength at all, that there, on looking back, I find the source of my
success. I have been very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have
worked much harder, and not succeeded half so well; but I never could
have done what I have done, without the habits of punetualily, order, and
diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one object
at a time, no matter how quickly its successor should come upon its heels,
which I then formed. Heaven knows I write this, in no spirit of self-
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         429
laudation. The man who reviews his own life, as I do mine, in going on
here, from page to page, had need to have been a good man indeed, if he
would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected, many
opportunities wasted, many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at
war within his breast, and defeating him. I do not hold one natural gift,
I dare say, that I have not abused. My meaning simply is, that whatever
I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do well; that
whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely ;
that, in great aims and in small, I have always been thoroughly in earnest.
I have never believed it possible that any natural or improved ability can
 claim immunity from the companionship of the steady, plain, hard-
 working qualities, and hope to gain its end. There is no such thing as
 such fulfilment on this earth. Some happy talent, and some fortunate
 opportunity, may form the two sides of the ladder on which some men
 mount, but the rounds of that ladder must be made of stuff to stand
 wear and tear; and there is no substitute for thorough-going, ardent,
 and sincere earnestness. Never to put one hand to anything, on which
 I could throw my whole self; and never to affect depreciation of my work,
 whatever it was ; I find, now, to have been my golden rules.
    How much of the practice I have just reduced to precept, I owe to
 Agnes, I will not repeat here. My narrative proceeds to Agnes, with a
 thankful love.
    She came on a visit of a fortnight to the Doctor's. Mr. Wickfield was
 the Doctor's old friend, and the Doctor wished to talk with him, and do him
 good. I t had been matter of conversation with Agnes when she was last
 in town, and this visit was the result. She and her father came together.
 I was not much surprised to hear from her that she had engaged to find a
 lodging in the neighbourhood for Mrs. Heep, whose rheumatic complaint
 required change of air, and who would be charmed to have it in such
 company. Neither was I surprised when, on the very next day, Uriah,
 like a dutiful son, brought his worthy mother to take possession.
    " You see, Master Copperfield," said he, as he forced himself upon my
 company for a turn in the Doctor's garden, " where a person loves, a
 person is a little jealous-leastways,    anxious to keep an eye on the
 beloved one."
    " Of whom are you jealous, now? " said I.

    "Thanks to you, Master Copperfield," he returned, " of no one in
 particular just at present-no male person, at least."
    " Do you mean that you are jealous of a female person ? "
    H e gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes, and laughed.
    "Really, Master Copperfield," he said, "-I should say Mister, but I
 know you '11 excuse the abit I 've got into-you 're so insinuating, that
 you draw me like a corkscrew ! Well, I don't mind telling you," putting
 his fish-like hand on mine, "I 'm not a lady's man in general, sir, and I
 never was, with Mrs. Strong."
    His eyes looked green now, as they watched mine with a rascally
 cunning.
    "What do you mean? " said I.
    "Why, though I am a lawyer, Master Copperfield," he replied, with a
 dry grin, "I mean, just at present, what I say."
430             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  " And what do you mean by your look? " I retorted, quietly.
  " By my look ? Dear me, Copperfield, that 's sharp practice ! What
do I mean by my look ? "
    " Yes," said I.   "By your look."
    He seemed very much amused, and laughed as heartily as it was in his
nature to laugh. After some scraping of his chin with his hand, he went
on to say, with his eyes cast downward-still scraping, very slowly:
    "When I was but a numble clerk, she always looked down upon me.
She was for ever having my Agnes backwards and forwards at her ouse,
and she was for ever being a friend to you, Master Copperfield ;but I was
too far beneath her, myself, to be noticed."
    " We11 ? " said I ; " suppose you were ! "
   "-And      beneath him, too," pursued TJriah, very distinctly, and in a
meditative tone of voice, as he continued to scrape his chin.
    "Don't you know the Doctor better," said I, "than to suppose him
conscious of your existence, when you were not before him ? "
   R e directed his eyes at me in that sidelong glance again, and he made
his face very lantern-jawed, for the greater convenience of scraping, as he
answered :
    "Oh dear, I am not referring to the Doctor ! Oh no, poor man ! I
mean Mr. Maldon ! "
    My heart quite died within me. All my old doubts and apprehensions
on that subject, all the Doctor's happiness and peace, all the mingled possi-
bilities of innocence and compromise, that I could not unravel, I saw, in a
moment, at the mercy of this fellow's twisting.
    " He never could come into the office, without ordering and shoving me

about," said Uriah. " One of your fine gentlemen he was ! I was very
meek and umble-and I am. But I didn't like that sort of thing-and I
don't ! "
    He left off scraping his chin, and sucked in his cheeks until they seemed
 to meet inside ; keeping his sidelong glance upon me all the while.
    " She is one of your lovely women, she is," he pursued, when he had
slowly restored his face to its natural form ; " and ready to be no friend to
such as me, I know. She's just the person as would put my Agnes up
to higher sort of game. Now, I ain't one of your lady's men, Master
Copperfield; but I've had eyes in my ed, a pretty long time back. We
umble ones have got eyes, nlostly speaking-and we look out of 'em."
    I endeavoured to appear unconscious and not disquieted, but, I saw in
his face, with poor success.
    " Now, I 'm not a going to let myself be run down, Copperfield," he
continued, raising that part of his countenance where his red eyebrows
would have been if he had had any, with malignant triumph, "and I
shall do what I can to put a stop to this friendship. I don't approve of
it. I don't mind acknowledging to you that I 've got rather a grudging
disposition, and want to keep off all intruders. I ain't a going, if I know it,
to run the risk of being plotted against."
   "You are always plotting, and delude yourself into the belief that
everybody else is doing the like, I think," said I.
   "Perhaps so, Master Copperfield," he replied.            "But I've got a
motive, as my fellow-partner used to say; and I go at it tooth and nail. I

mustn't be put upon, as a numble person, too much. I can't allow
people in my way. Really they must come out of the cart, Master
Copperfield ! "
    " I don't understand you," said I.
    "Don't you, though?" he returned, with one of his jerks. " I ' m
astonished at that, Master Copperfield, you being usually so quick ! 1 I'll
try to be plainer, another time.-Is that Mr. Maldon a-norseback, ringing
at the gate, sir?"
    " I t looks like him," I replied, as carelessly as I could.

   Uriah stopped short, put his hands between his great knobs of knees,
and doubled himself up with laughter. With perfectly silent laughter.
Not a sound escaped from him. I was so repelled by his odious beha-
viour, particularly by this concluding instance, that I turned away without
any ceremony; and left him doubled up in the middle of the garden, like
a scarecrow in want of support.
    I t was not on that evening; but, as I well remember, on the next
evening but one, which was a Saturday; that I took Agnes to see Dora.
I had arranged the visit, beforehand, with Miss Lavinia; and Agnes was
 expected to tea.
    I was in a flutter of pride and anxiety ; pride in my dear little betrothed,
 and anxiety that Agnes should like her. All the way to Putney, Agnes
being inside the stage-coach, and I outside, I pictured Dora to myself in
every one of the pretty looks I knew so well; now making up my mind
that I should like her to look exactly as she looked at such a time, and
then doubting whether I should not prefer her looking as she looked at
such another time ; and almost worrying myself into a fever about it.
   I was troubled by no doubt of her being very pretty, in any case; but
it fell out that I had never seen her look so well. She was not in the
drawing-room when I presented Agnes to her little aunts, but was shyly
keeping out of the way. I knew where to look for her, now; and sure
enough I found her stopping her ears again, behind the same dull old
door.
   ,4t first she wouldn't come at all ; and then she pleaded for five minutes
by my watch. When at length she pui, her arm through mine, to be taken
to the drawing-room, her charming little face was flushed, and had never
been so pretty. But, when we went into the room, and it turned pale, she
was ten thousand times prettier j7et.
   Dora was afraid of Agnes. She had told me that she knew Agnes was
"too clever." But when she saw her looking at once so cheerful and so
earnest, and so thoughtful, and so good, she gave a faint little cry of
pleased surprise, and just put her affectionate arms round Agnes's neck,
and laid her innocent cheek against her face.
   I never was so happy. 1never was so pleased as when I saw those two
sit down together, side by side. As when I saw my little darling looking
up so naturally to those cordial eyes. As when I saw the tender, beautiful
regard which Agnes cast upon her.
   Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa partook, in their way, of my joy. It
was the pleasantest tea-table in the world. Miss Clarissa presided. I cut
and handed the sweet seed-cake-the little sisters had a bird-like fondness
for picking up seeds and pecking at sugar ; Niss Lavinia looked on with
432          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

benignant patronage, as if our happy love were all her work ; and we were
perfectly contented with ourselves and one another.
   The gentle cheerfulness of Agnes went to all their hearts. Her q~liet
interest in everything that interested Dora; her manner of making
acquaintance with Jip (who responded instantly) ; her pleasant way, when
Dora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me; her modest
grace and ease, eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence
from Dora ; seemed to make our circle quite complete.
   " I am so glad," said Dora, after tea, "that you like me. I didn't
think you would; and I want, more than ever, to be liked, now Julia
Mills is gone."
   I have omitted to mention it, by-the-bye. Miss Mills had sailed, and
Dora and I had gone aboard a great East Indiaman at Gravesend to see
her; and we had had preserved ginger, and guava, and other delicacies
of that sort for lunch; and mc had left Miss Mills weeping on a camp-
stool on the quarter-deck, with a large new diary under her arm, in which
the original reflections awakened by the contemplation of Ocean were to be
recorded under lock and key.
   Agnes said, she was afraid I must have given her an unpromising cha-
racter; but Dora corrected that directly.
   " Oh no ! " she said, shaking her curls at me; " i t was all praise. H e
thinks so much of your opinion, that I was quite afraid of it."
   " My good opinion cannot strengthen his attachment to some people
whom he knows," said Agnes, with a smile ; "it is not worth their having."
   " But please let me have it," said Dora, in her coaxing way, "if you

can ! "
   We made merry about Dora's wanting to be liked, and Dora said I was
a goose, and she didn't like me at any rate, and the short evening flew
away on gossamer-wings. The time was at hand when the coach was to
call for us. I was standing alone before the fire, when Dora came
stealing softly in, to give me that usual precious little kiss before I
went.
   "Don't you think, if I had had her for a friend a long time ago,
Doady," said Dora, her bright eyes shining very brightly, and her little
right hand idly busying itself with one of the buttons of my coat, " I
mighi have been more clever perhaps? "
   '< My love ! " said I, " what nonsense ! "
   "Do you think it is nonsense?" returned Dora, without looking at
me. "Are you sure it is ? "
   " Of course I am ! "

   c r I have forgotten,'' said Dora, still turning the button round and round,
" what relation Agnes is to you, you dear bad boy."
   " No blood-relation," I replied ; " but we were brought up together,
like brother and sister."
   "I wonder why you ever fell in love with me? " said Dora, beginning
on another button of my coat.
   "Perhaps because I couldn't see you, and not love you, Dora ! "
   " Suppose you had never seen me at all," said Dora, going to another
button.
   " Suppose we had never been born ! " said I, gaily.

   I wondered what she was thinking about, as I glanced in admiring
silence at the little soft hand travelling up the row of buttons on my coat,
and at the clustering hair that lay against my breast, and at t,he lashes of
her downcast eyes, slightly rising as they followed her idle fingers. At
length her eyes were lifted up to mine, and she stood on tiptoe to give
me, more thoughtfully than usual, that precious little kiss-once, twice,
three times-and went out of the room.
   They all came back together within five minutes afterwards, and Dora's
unusual thoughtfulness was quite gone then. She was laughingly resolved
to put Jip through the whole of his performances, before the coach came.
They took some time (not so much on account of their variety, as Jip's
reluctance), and were still unfinished when it was heard at the door. There
was a hurried but affectionate parting between Agnes and herself; and
Dora was to write to Agnes (who was not to mind her letters being foolish,
she said), and Agnes was to write to Dora; and they had a second parting
at the coach-door, and a third when Dora, in spite of the remonstrances of
Miss Lavinia, would come running out once more to remind Agnes at the
coach-window about writing, and to shake her curls at me on the box.
    The stage-coach was to put us down near Covent Garden, where we
 mere to take another stage-coach for Highgate. I was impatient for the
 short walk in the interval, that Agnes might praise Dora to me. Ah!
 what praise it was ! How lovingly and fervently did it commend the
pretty creature I had won, with all her artless graces best displayed, to
my most gentle care ! I-Iow thoughtfully remind me, yet with 110 pretence
 of doing so, of the trust in which I held the orphan child !
    Never, never, had I loved Dora so deeply and truly, as I loved her that
night. When we had again alighted, and were walking in the starlight
along the quiet road that led to the Doctor's house, I told Agnes it was
her doing.
    "When you were sitting by her," said I, "you seemed to be no less
fzer guardian angel than mine ; and you seem so now, Agnes."
     " A poor angel," she returned, " but faithful."

    'Che clear tone of her voice, going straight to my heart, made it natural
 to me to say :
     "The cheerfulness that belongs to you, Agnes (and to no one else that
 ever I have seen), is so restored, 1 have observed to-day, that I have begun
 to hope you are happier at home ? "
     " I am happier in myself," she said ; " I am quite cheerful and light-

 hearted."
     I glanced at the serene face looking upward, and thought it was the
 stars that made it seem so noble.
     " There has been no change at home," said Agnes, after a few moments.
     " No fresh reference," said I, " to-I wouldn't distress you, Agnes, but
 I cannot help asking-to what we spoke of, when we parted last? "
     '' NO, none," she answered.
     "I have thought so much about it."
     " You must think less about it.    Remember that I confide in simple love
 and truth at last. Have no apprehensions for me, Trotwood," she added,
 after a moment; "the step you dread my taking, I shall never take."
    Although I think I had never really feared it, in any season of cool
                                                               B F

 reflection, it was an unspeakable relief to me to have this assurance from
 her own truthful lips. 1told her so, earnestly.
    "And when this visit is over," said I,-" for we may not be alone
 another time,--how long is it likely to be, my dear Agnes, before you come
to London again? "
    " Probably a long time,"   she replied; " I think it will be best-for
papa's sake-to remain at home. We are not likely to meet often, for
some time to come; but I shall be a good correspondent of Dora's, and
we shall frequently hear of one another that way."
    We were now within the little court-yard of the Doctor's cottage.
I t was growing late. There was a light in the window of Mrs. Strong's
chamber, and Agnes, pointing to it, bade me good night.
    "Do not be troubled," she said, giving me her hand, "by our mis-
fortunes and anxieties. I can be happier in nothing than in your happi-
ness. If you can ever give me help, rely upon it I will ask you for it. God
bless yon always ! "
    In her beaming smile, and in these last tones of her cheerful voice, I
seemed again to see and hear my little Dora in her company. I stood
awhile, looking through the porch at the stars, with a heart full of love and
gratitude, and then walked slowly forth. I had engaged a bed at a decent
alehouse close by, and was going out at the gate, when, happening to turn
my head, I saw a light in the Doctor's study. A half-reproachful fancy
came into my mind, that he had been working at the Dictionary without
my help. With the view of seeing if this were so, and, in any case, of
bidding him good night, if he were yet sitting among his books, I turned
back, and going softly across the hall, and gently opening the door,
looked in.
    The first person whom I saw, to my surprise, by the sober light of the
shaded lamp, was Uriah. He was standing close beside it, with one of
his skeleton hands over his mouth, and the other resting on the Doctor's
table. The Doctor sat in his study chair, covering his face with his
hands. Mr. Wickfield, sorely troubled and distressed, was leaning
forward, irresolutely touching the Doctor's arm.
    For an instant, I supposed that the Doctor was ill. I hastily advanced
a step under that impression, when I met Uriah's eye, and saw what was
the matter. I wonld have withdrawn, but the Doctor made a gesture to
detain me, and I remained.
    "At any rate," observed Uriah, with a writhe of his ungainly person,
"we may keep the door shut. We needn't make it known to a m the
town."
    Saying which, he went on his toes to the door, which I had left open,
and carefully closed it. I l e then came back, and took up his former
position. There was an obtrusive show of compassionate zeal in his
voice and manner, more intolerable-at least to me-than any demeanour
he could have assumed.
    " I have felt it incumbent upon me, Master Copperfield,"     said Uriah,
"to point out to Doctor Strong what you and me have already talked
about. You didn't exactly understand me, though ? "
    1 gave him a look, but no other answer; and, going to my good old
master, said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort and encou-
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            436
ragement. H e put his hand upon my shoulder, as it had been his custom
to do when I was quite a little fellow, but did not lift his grey head.
   "As you didn't understand me, Master Copperfield," resumed Uriah
in the same officious manner, " I may take the liberty of umbly men-
tioning, being among friends, that I have called Doctor Strong's attention
to the goings-on of Mrs. Strong. I t ' s much against the grain with me,
T assure you, Copperfield, to be concerned in anything so unpleasant;
but really, as it is, we 're all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't
to be. That was what my meaning was, sir, when you didn't under-
stand me."
    I wonder now, when I recall his leer, that I did not collar him, and try
to shake the breath out of his body.
    " I dare say I didn't malie myself very clear," he went on, " nor you
neither. Naturally, we was both of us inclined to give such a subject a
wide berth. EIows'ever, at last I have made up my mind to speak plain;
and I have mentioned to Doctor Strong that-did you speak, sir ? "
    This mas to the Doctor, who had moaned. The sound might have
touched any heart, I thought, but it had no effect upon Uriah's.
    "-    mentioned to Doctor Strong," he proceeded, "that any one
 may see that Mr. Maldon, and the lovely and agreeable lady as is Doctor
 Strong's wife, are too sweet on one another. Really the time is come
 (we being at present all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn't to be),
 when Doctor Strong must be told that this was full as plain to everybody
 as the sun, before Jlr. Maldon went to India; that 1Mr. Maldon made
 excuses to come back, for nothing else; and that he's always here, for
 nothing else. When you come in, sir, I was jnst putting it to my fellow-
partner," towards whom he turned, " to say to Doctor Strong upon his
word and honor, whether he 'd ever been of this opinion long ago, or not.
 Come, Mr. Wiclcfield, sir! Would you be so good  -       as tell u s ? Yes or
 no, sir ? Come, partner ! "
    "Por God's salce, my dear Doctor," said Mr. Wickfield, again laying
 his irresolute hand upon the Doctor's arm, "don't attach too much
 weight to any suspicions I may have entertained."
    "There ! " cried Uriah, shaking his head. "What a melancholy
 confirmation : ain't i t ? Him ! Such an old friend ! Bless your soul,
 when I was nothing but a clerk in his office, Copperfield, I've seen
 him twenty times, if I've seen him once, quite in a taking about it-
 quite put out, you know (and very proper in him as a father; I ' m sure I
 can't blame him), to think that Miss Agnes was mixing herself up with
 what oughtn't to be."
    " My dear Strong," said Mr. Wickfield in a tremulous voice, "my
 good friend, I needn't tell you that it has been my vice to look for some
 one master motive in everybody, and to try all actions by one narrow test.
 I may have fallen into such doubts as I have had, through this mistake."
     "Yon have had doubts, Wickfield," said the Doctor, without lifting up
 his head. "You have had doubts."
     " Speak up, fellonr-partner," urged Uriah.

     " I had, at one time, certainly," said Mr. Wiclifield. " I-God forgive
 me-I thought you had."
     '(No, no, no ! " returned the Doctor, in a tone of most pathetic grief.

     " I thought, at one time," said Mr. Wickfield, "that you wished to
 send Maldon abroad to effect a desirable separation."
     " No, no, no ! " returned the Doctor. " To give Annie pleasure, by
 making some provision for the companion of her childhood. Nothing
 else."
     "So I found," said Mr. Wickfield. " I couldn't doubt it, when you
 told me so. But I thought-1 implore you to remember the narrow con-
 struction which has been my besetting sin-that, in a case where there was
 so much disparity in point of years-"
     " That's the way to put it, you see, Master Copperfield ! " observed

 Uriah, with fawning and offensive pity.
     " - a lady of such youth, and such attractions, however real her

 respect for you, might have been influenced in marrying, by ~vorldlycon-
 siderations only. I made no allowance for innumerable feelings and
 circumstances that may have all tended to good. For Heaven's sake
remember that ! "
     " FIow kind he puts it ! " said Uriah, shaking his head.

     " Always observing her from one point of view," said Mr. Wickfield ;
 "but by all that is dear to you, my old friend, I entreat you to consider
 what it was ; I am forced to confess now, having no escape-"
     "No ! There's no way out of it, Mr. Wickfield, sir," observed Uriah,
 "when it's got to this."
     " - that I did," said Mr. Vickfield, glancing helplessly and distractedly

 at his partner, "that I did doubt her, and think her wanting in her duty
 to you; and that I did sometimes, if I must say all, feel averse to Agnes
 being in such a familiar relation towards her, as to see what I saw, or
 in my diseased theory fancied that I saw. I never mentioned this to any
 one. I never meant it to be known to any one. And though it is terrible
 to you to hear," said Mr. Wickfield, quite subdued, "if you knew how
 terrible it is to me to tell, you would feel compassion for me ! "
     The Doctor, in the perfect goodness of his nature, put out his hand.
 Mr. Wickfield held it for a little while in his, with his head bowed
 down.
     " I am sure," said Uriah, writhing himself into the silence like a
 Conger-eel, "that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to everybody.
 But since we have got so far, I ought to take the liberty of mentioning
 that Copperfield has noticed it too."
     I turned upon him, and asked him how he dared refer to me !
     " Oh ! it's very kind of you, Copperfield," returned Uriah, undulating

all over, "and we all know what an amiable character yours is ; but you
know that the moment I spoke to you the other night, you knew what I
meant. You know you knew what I meant, Copperfield. Don't deny
i t ! You deny it with the best intentions; but don't do it, Copper-
field
--    !"
  . ...
     -


   I saw the mild eye of the good old Doctor turned upon me for a
moment, and I felt that the confession of my old misgivings and remem-
brances was too plainly written in my face to be overlooked. I t was of no
use raging. I could not undo that. Say what I would, I could not
unsay it.
   We were silent again, and remained so, until the Doctor rose and
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         437
walked twice or thrice across the room. Presently he returned to where
his chair stood ; and, leaning on the back of it, and occasionally putting
his handkerchief to his eyes, with a simple honesty that did him more
honor, to my thinking, than any disguise he could have affected, said :
   "I have been much to blame. I believe I have been very much to
blame. I have exposed one whom I hold in my heart, to trials and
aspersions-I     call them aspersions, even to have been conceived in
anybody's inmost mind-of which she never, but for me, could have been
the object."
   Uriah EIeep gave a kind of snivel. I think to express sympathy.
   "Of which my Annie," said the Doctor, "never, but for me, could
have been the object. Gentlemen, I am old now, as you know; I do
not feel, to-night, that I have much to live for. But my life-my Life-
upon the truth and honor of the dear lady who has been the subject of
this conversation ! "
   I do not think that the best embodiment of chivalry, the realisation
of the handsomest and most romantic figure ever imagined by painter,
could have said this, with a more impressive and affecting dignity than
the plain old Doctor did.
    "But I am not prepared," he went on, "to deny-perhaps I may
have been, without knowing it, in some degree prepared to admit-that
I may have unwittingly ensnared that lady into an unhappy marriage.
I am a man quite unaccustomed to observe ; and I cannot but believe
that the observation of several people, of different ages and positions, all
too plainly tending in one direction (and that so natural), is better than
mine."
   I had often admired, as I have elsewhere described, his benignant
manner towards his youthful wife ; but the respectful tenderness he
manifested in every reference to her on this occasion, and the almost
reverential manner in which he put away from him the lightest doubt
of her integrity, exalted him, in my eyes, beyond description.
   " I married that lady," said the Doctor, "when she was extremely
young. I took her to myself when her character was scarcely formed.
So far as it was developed, it had been my happiness to form it. I knew
her father well. I knew her well. I had taught her what I could, for
the love of all her beautiful and virtuous qualities. If I did her wrong ;
as I fear I did, in taking advantage (but I never meant it) of her
 gratitude and her affection ; I ask pardon of that lady, in my heart !"
    H e walked across the room, and came back to the same place; holding
the chair with a grasp that trembled, like his subdued voice, in its
earnestness.
    " I regarded myself     as a refuge, for her, from the dangers and
 vicissitudes of life. I persuaded myself that, unequal though we were in
 years, she would live tranquilly and contentedly with me. I did not shut
 out of my consideration the time when I should leave her free, and still
 young and still beautiful, but with her judgment more matured-no,
 gentlemen-upon my truth ! "
    His homely figure seemed to be lightened up by his fidelity and
 generosity. Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could
 have imparted to it.
438           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   " My life with this lady has been very happy.      Until to-night, I have
had uninterrupted occasion to bless the day on which I did her great
injustice."
   His voice, more and more faltering in the utterance of these words,
stopped for a few moments; then he went on :
   " Once awakened from my dream-I        have been a poor dreamer, in one
way or other, all my life-I     see how natural it is that she should have
some regretful feeling towards her old companion and her equal. That
she does regard him with some innocent regret, with some blameless
thoughts of what might have been, but for me, is, I fear, too true.
Much that I have seen, but not noted, has come back upon me with new
meaning, during this last trying hour. But, beyond this, gentlemen, the
dear lady's name never must be coupled with a word, a breath, of doubt."
   For a little while, his eye kindled and his voice was firm ; for a little
while he was again silent. Presently, he proceeded as before :
   " I t only remains for me, to bear the knowledge of the unhappiness

I have occasioned, as submissively as I can. It is she who should
reproach ; not I. To save her from misconstruction, cruel miscon-
struction, that even my friends have not been able to avoid, becomes my
duty. The more retired we live, the better I shall discharge it. And
when the time comes-may it come soon, if it be His merciful pleasure!-
when my death shall release her from constraint, I shall close my eyes
upon her honored face, with ~xnboundedconfidence and love; and leave
her, wit11 no sorrow then, to happier and brighter days.
   I could not see him for the tears which his earnestness and goodness,
 so adorned by, and so adorning, the perfect simplicity of his manner,
brought into my eyes. He had moved to the door, when he added :
   " Gentlemen, I have shown you my heart.       I am sure you will respect
it. What we have said to-night is never to be said more. Wickfield,
give me an old friend's arm up-stairs ! "
   Mr. Wickfield hastened to him. Without interchanging a word they
went slowly out of the room together, Uriah looking after them.
   "Well, Master Copperfield ! " said Uriah, meekly turning to me. " The
thing hasn't took quite the turn that might have been expected, for the old
Scholar-what an excellent man !-is as blind as a brickbat; but this
family's out of the cart, I think ! '"
   I needed bnt the sonnd of his voice to be so madly enraged as I never
was before, and never have been since.
   " You ~lllain," said I, "what do you mean by entrapping me into your

schemes? How dare you appeal to me just now, you false rascal, as if we
had been in discussion together ? :'
   As we stood, front to front, I saw so plainly, in the stealthy exultation
of his face, what I already so plainly knew; I mean that he forced his
confidence upon me, expressly to make me miserable, and had set a
deliberate trap for me in this very matter; that I couldn't bear it. The
whole of his lank cheek was invitingly before me, and I struck it with my
open hand with that force that my Sngers tingled as if I had burnt
them.
   Me caught the hand in his, and we stood, in that connexion, looking
at each other. R e stood so, a long time; long enough for me to see the
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          439
white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek, and leave
it a deeper red.
   " Copperfield," he said at length, in a breathless voice, "have you
taken leave of your senses?
    " I have taken leave of you," said I, wresting my hand away.       " You
dog, I'll know no more of you."
    " Won't you ? " said he, constrained by the pain of his cheek to put
his hand there. "Perhaps you won't be able to help it. Isn't this
ungrateful of you, now ? "
    " I have shown you often enough," said I, " that I despise you. I have
shown yon now, more plainly, that I do. Why should I dread your
doing your worst to all about you? What else do you ever do?"
   He perfectly understood this allusion to the considerations that had
hitherto restrained me in my communications with him. I rather think
that neither the blow, nor the allusion, would have escaped me, but for
the assurance I had had from Agnes that night. I t is no matter.
   There was another long pause. His eyes, as he looked at me, seemed
to take every shade of color .that could make eyes ugly.
      Copperfield," he said, removing his hand from his cheek, " you have
always gone against me. I know you always used to be against me at
Mr. Wlckfield's."
    " You may think what you like," said I, still in a towering rage. r' If
it is not true, so much the worthier you."
    " And yet I always liked you, Copperfield !" he rejoined.

   I deigned to make him no reply; and, taking up my hat, was going out
to bed, when he came between me and the door.
    " Copperfield," he said, " there must be two parties to a quarrel.
1won't be one."
    " You may go to the devil ! " said I.
   '< Don't say that ! " he replied.   " I know you 1' 1 be sorry afterwards.
How can you make yourself so inferior to me, as to show such a bad spirit ?
But I forgive you."
    " You forgive me ! " I repeated disdainfully.

   " I do, and yon can't help yourself," replied Uriah. "To think of
your going and attacking me, that have always been a friend to you! But
there can't be a quarrel without two parties, and I won't be one. I will
be a friend to you, in spite of you. So now you know what you've got to
expect ."
   The necessity of carrying on this dialogue (his part in which was very
slow; mine very quick) in a low tone, that the house might not be dis-
turbed at an unseasonable hour, did not improve my temper ; though my
passion was cooling down. nixerely telling him that I should expect from
him what I always had expected, and had never yet been disappointed in,
I opened the door upon him, as if he had been a great walnut put there
to be cracked, and went out of the house. But he slept out of the house
too, at his mother's lodging; and before I had gone many hundred yards,
came up with me.
   " You know, Copperfield," he said, in my ear (I did not turn my

head), " you're in quite a wrong position ;" which I felt to be true,
and that made me chafe the more ; " you can't make this a brave thing,
440            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  and you can't help being forgiven. I don't intend to mention it to mother,
 nor to any living soul. I ' m determined to forgive you. But I do wonder
 that you should lift your hand against a person that you knew to be so
 umble ! "
    I felt only less mean than he. He knew me better than I knew myself.
 If he had retorted, or openly exasperated me, it would have been a relief
 and a justification; but he had put me on a slow fire, on which I lay
 tormented half the night.
    I n the morning, when I came out, the early church bell was ringing,
 and he was walking up and down with his mother. H e addressed me as
 if nothing had happened, and I could do no less than reply. I had struck
 him hard enough to give him the toothache, I suppose. At all events his
 face was tied up in a black silk handkerchief, which, with his hat perched
 on the top of it, was far from improving his appearance. I heard that he
 went to a dentist's in London on the Monday morning, and had a tooth
 out. I hope it was a double one.
    The Doctor gave out that he was not quite well; and remained alone,
 for a considerable part of every day, during the remainder of the visit.
 Agnes and her father had been gone a week, before we resumed our usual
work. On the day preceding its resumption, the Doctor gave me with his
 own hands a folded note not sealed. I t was addressed to myself; and
laid an injunction on me, in a few affectionate words, never to refer to
 the subject of that evening. I had confided it to my aunt, but to no one
 else. I t was not a subject I could discuss with Agnes, and Agnes cer-
 tainly had not the least suspicion of what had passed.
    Neither, I felt convinced, had Mrs. Strong then. Several weeks elapsed
 before I saw the least change in her. I t came on slowly, like a cloud when
 there is no wind. At first, she seemed to wonder at the gentle compassion
 with which the Doctor spoke to her, and at his wish that she should have
 her mother with her, to relieve the dull monotony of her life. Often, when we
were at work, and she was sitting by, I would see her pausing and looking
 at him with that memorable face. Afterwards, I sometimes observed her
 rise, with her eyes full of tears, and go out of the room. Gradually,
 an unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty, and deepened every day. Mrs.
 Markleham was a regular inmate of the cottage then ; but she talked and
talked, and saw nothing.
    As this change stole on Annie, once like sunshine in the Doctor's house,
the Doctor became older in appearance, and more grave ; but the sweetness
of his temper, the placid kindness of his manner, and his benevolent
solicitude for her, if they were capable of any increase, were increased.
I saw him once, early on the morning of her birthday, when she came to
sit in the window while we were at work (which she had always done, but
now began to do with a timid and uncertain air that I thought very
touching), take her forehead between his hands, kiss it, and go hurriedly
away, too much moved to remain. I saw her stand where he had left
her, like a statue; and then bend down her head, and clasp her hands,
and weep, I cannot say how sorrowfully.
    Sometimes, after that, I fancied that she tried to speak even to me, in
intervals when we were left alone. But she never uttered word. The
Doctor always had some new project for her participating in amusements
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          441
away from home, with her mother ; and Mrs. hlarkleham, who was very
fond of amusements, and very easily dissatisfied with anything else, en-
tered into them with great good will, and was loud in her commenda-
tions. But Annie, in a spiritless unhappy way, only went whither she
was led, and seemed to have no care for anything.
   I did not know what to think. Neither did my aunt; who must have
walked, at various times, a hundred miles in her uncertainty. What was
strangest of all was, that the only real relief which seemed to make its way
into the secret region of this domestic unhappiness, made its way there in
the person of Mr. Dick.
   What his thoughts were on the subject, or what his observation was,
I am as unable to explain, as I dare say he would have been to assist me
in the task. But, as I have recorded in the narrative of my school days,
his veneration for the Doctor was unbounded; and there is a subtlety of
perception in real attachment, even when it is borne towards man by one
of the lower animals, which leaves the highest intellect behind. To this
mind of the heart, if I may call it so, in Mr. Dick, some bright ray of the
truth shot straight.
    ITe had proudly resumed his privilege, in many of his spare hours, of
walking up and down the garden with the Doctor; as he had been accus-
tomed to pace up and down The Doctor's Walk at Canterbury. But
matters were no sooner in this state, than he devoted all his spare time
(and got up earlier to make it more) to these perambulations. If he had
never been so happy as when the Doctor read that mavellous performance,
the Dictionary, to him ; he was now quite miserable unless the Doctor
pulled it out of his pocket, and began. When the Doctor and I were
engaged, he now fell into the custom of walking up and down with
Mrs. Strong, and helping her to trim her favorite flowers, or weed the
beds. I dare say he rarely spolie a dozen wordsin an hour: but his quiet
interest, and his wistful face, found immediate response in both their
breasts ; each knew that the other liked him, and that he loved both; and
he became what no one else could be-a link between them.
    When I think of him, with his impenetrably wise face, walking up and
 down with the Doctor, delighted to be battered by the hard words in the
Dictionary ; when I think of him carrying huge watering-pots after Annie ;
kneeling down, in very paws of gloves, at patient microscopic work among
the little leaves ; expressing as no philosopher could have expressed, in
 every thing he did, a delicate desire to be her friend ; showering sympathy,
trustfulness, and affection, out of every hole in the watering-pot ; when I
think of him never wandering in that better mind of his to which unhap-
piness addressed itself, never bringing the unfortunate King Charles
into the garden, never wavering in his grateful service, never diverted
 from his knowledge that there was something wrong, or from his wish
 to set it right-I really feel almost ashamed of having known that he was
 not quite in his wits, taking account of the utmost I have done with
 mine.
    " Nobody but myself, Trot, knows what that man is !" my aunt would
~ r o u d l vremark, when we conversed about it. "Dick will distinguish -
Limsel? yet ! " -
    I must refer to one other topic before I close this chapter. While the
44 2           THE PERSONAL HISTOHS AND EXPERIESCE

visit at the Doctor's was still in progress, I observed that the postman
brought two or three letters every morning for Uriah EIeep, who remained
at Highgate until the rest went back, it being a leisure time ; and that these
were always directed in a business-like manner by Mr. Micawber, who now
assumed a round legal hand. I was glad to infer, from these slight
premises, that Mi.. nllicawber was doing well; and consequently was
much surprised to receive, about this time, the follorving letter from his
amiable wife.
                                             " CANTERBURY,
                                                        Idonday .Evening.

             " You will doubtless be surprised, my dear Mr. Copperfield, to
 receive this communication. Still more so, by its contents. Still more so,
 by the stipulation of implicit confidence which I beg to impose. But
 my feelings as a wife and mother require relief; and as I do not wish to
 consult my family (already obnoxious to the feelings of Mr. Micawber), I
 know no one of whom I can better asli advice than my friend and former
 lodger.
    " You may be avrare, my dear Mr. Copperfield, that between myself and
Mr. Micawber (whom I will never desert), there has always been preserved
 a spirit of mutual confidence. Mr. Micawber may have occasionally given a
 bill without consulting me, or he may have misled me as to the period
 when that obligation would become due. This has actually happened. But,
 in general, Mr. Micarvber has had no secrets from the bosom of affection-
 I allude to his wife-and has invariably, on our retirement to rest, recalled
 the events of the day.
    "You will picture to yourself, my dear Mr. Copperfield, what the
 poignancy of my feelings must be, when 4: inform you that Mr. Micawber
 is entirely changed. He is reserved. He is secret. His life is a mystery
 to the partner of his joys and sorrows-I again allude to his wife-and if
 I should assure you that beyond knowing that it is passed from morning to
 night at the office, I now know less of it than I do of the man in the south,
 connected with whose mouth the thoughtless children repeat an idle tale
 respecting cold plum porridge, I should adopt a popular fallacy to express
 an actual fact.
    " But this is not all. Mr. 3Iicawber is morose. H e is severe. He is
 estranged from our eldest son and daughter, he has no pride in his twins,
 he looks with an eye of coldness even on the unoffending stranger who
last became a member of our circle. The pecuniary means of meeting
 our expenses, kept down to the utmost farthing, are obtained from him
with great difficulty, and even under fearful threats that he will Settle
himself (the exact expression); and he inexorably refuses to give any
exolanation whatever of this distracting ~olicv.
   $' This is hard to bear. This is huek-t-bieaking. If you will advise
me, knowing my feeble powers such as they are, how you think it will be
best to exert them in a dilemma so unwonted, you will add another friendly
obligation to the many you have already rendered me. With loves from
the children, and a smile from the happily-unconscious stranger, I remain,
dear Mr. Copperfield,
                                            " Your afflicted

   I did not feel justified in giving a wife of Mrs. Micawber's experience
any other recommendation, than that she should try to reclaim Mr. Micaw-
ber by patience and kindness (as I knew she would in any case); but the
letter set me thinking about him very much.

                          ANOTHER RETROSPECT.

    ONCEagain, let me pause upon a memorable period of my life. Let me
stand aside, to see the phantoms of those days go by me, accompanying
the shadow of myself, in dim procession.
    Weeks, months, seasons, pass along. They seem little more than a
summer day and a winter evening. Now, the Common where I walk with
Dora is all in bloom, a field of bright gold ; and now the unseen heather
lies in mounds and bunches underneath a covering of snow. I n a breath,
the river that flows through our Sunday walks is sparkling in the summer
sun, is ruffled by the winter wind, or thickened with drifting heaps of ice.
Faster than ever river ran towards the sea, it flashes, darkens, and
rolls away.
   Not a thread changes, in the house of the two little bird-like ladies.
The clock ticks over the fire-place, the weather-glass hangs in the hall.
Neither clock nor weather-glass is ever right; but we believe in both,
devoutly.
   I have come legally to man's estate. I have attained the dignity of
twmty-one. But this is a sort of dignity that may be thrust upon one.
Let me think what I have achieved.
    I have tamed that savage stenographic mystery. I make a respectable
income by it. I am in high repute for my accomplishment in all pertaining
to the art, and am joined with eleven others in reporting the debates in
Parliament for a Morning Newspaper. Night after night, I record predic-
tions that never come to pass, professions that are never fulfilled, explana-
tions that are only meant to mystify. I wallow in words. Britannia, that
unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed fowl: skewered
through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and foot with red
tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of polltical
life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted.
    My dear old Traddles has tried his hand at the same pursuit, but it is
not in Traddles's way. He is perfectly good-humoured respecting his
failure, and reminds me that he always did consider himself slow. H e
has occasional employment on the same newspaper, in getting up the facts
of dry subjects, to be written about and embellished by more fertile minds.
We is called to the bar; and with admirable industry and self-denial has
scraped another hundred pounds together, to fee a Conveyancer whose
chambers he attends. A great deal of very hot port wine was consumed
444           THE PERSONAL HISTORY lLUD EXPERIENCE

 at his call; and, considering the figure, I should think the Inner Temple
 must have made a profit by it.
     I have come out in another way. I have taken with fear and trembling
 to authorship. I wrote a little something, in secret, and sent it to a
 magazine, and it was published in the magazine. Since then, I have taken
 heart to write a good many trifling pieces. Now, I am regularly paid
 for them. Altogether, I am well off; when I tell my income on the
 fingers of my left hand, I pass the third finger and take in the fourth to
 the middle joint.
    We have removed, from Buckingham Street, to a pleasant little cottage
 very near the one I looked at, when my enthusiasm first came on. My
 aunt, however (who has sold the house at Dover, to good advantage), is
 not going to remain here, but intends removing herself to a still more
 tiny cottage close at hand. What does this portend? My marriage?
 Yes !
    Yes! I am going to be married to Dora! Miss Lavinia and Miss
 Clarissa have given their consent; and if ever canary birds were in a flutter,
they are. Miss Lavinia, self-charged with the superintendence of my
darling's wardrobe, is constantly cutting out brown-paper cuirasses, and
differing in opinion from a highly respectable young man, with a long
bundle, and a yardmeasureunder his arm. A dressmaker, always stabbed
in the breast with a needle and thread, boards and lodges in the house;
and seems to me, eating, drinking, or sleeping, never to take her thimble
off. They make a lay-figure of my dear. They are always sending for
her to come and try something on. We can't be happy together for five
minutes in the evening, but some intrusive female knocks at the door, and
 says, " Oh, if you please, Miss Dora, would you step up-stairs ! "
    Miss Clarissa and my aunt roam all over London, to find out articles of
furniture for Dora and me to look at. I t would be better for them to buy
the goods at once, without this ceremony of inspection ; for, when we go to
see a kitchen fender and meat-screen, Dora sees a Chinese house for Jip,
with little bells on the top, and prefers that. And it takes a long time to
accustom Jip to his new residence, after we have bought i t ; whenever
he goes in or out, he makes all the little bells ring, and is horribly
frightened.
    Yeggotty comes up to make herself useful, and falls to work imme-
diately. Her department appears to be, to clean everything over and over
again. She rubs everything that can be rubbed, until it shines, like her
own honest forehead, with perpetual friction. And now it is, that I begin
to see her solitary brother passing through the dark streets at night, and
looking, as he goes, among the wandering faces. I never speak to him at
such an hour. I know too well, as his grave figure passes onward, what
he seeks, and what he dreads.
    Why does Traddles look so important when he calls upon me this
afternoon in the Commons-where I still occasionally attend, for form's
sake, when I have time? The realisation of my boyish day-dreams is at
hand. I am going to take out the license.
    I t is a little document to do so much; and Traddles contemplates it, as
it lies upon my desk, half in admiration, half in awe. There are the names,
in the sweet old visionary connexion, David Copperfield and Dora Spenlow ;
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           4.45
 and there, in the corner, is that Parental Institution, the Stamp Office,
 which is so benignantly interested in the various transactions of human
 life, looking down upon our Union ; and there is the Archbishop of Can-
 terbury invoking a blessing on us in print, and doing it as cheap as could
 possibly be expected.
    Nevertheless, I am in a dream, a flustered, happy, hurried dream. I
 can't believe that it is going to be; and yet I can't believe but that every-
 one I pass in the street, must have some kind of perception, that I am to
 be married the day after to-morrow. The Surrogate knows me, when I go
 down to be sworn ; and disposes of me easily, as if there were a Masonic
 understanding between us. Traddles is not at all wanted, but is in attend-
 ance as my general backer.
    " I hope the next time you come here, my dear fellow," I say to
Traddles, it will be on the same errand for yourself. And I hope it will
be soon."
    <' Thank you for your good wishes, my dear Copperfield," he replies.
"I hope so too. I t 's a satisfaction to know that she 1' 1 wait for me any
length of time, and that she really is the dearest girl-"
    " When are you to meet her at the coach ? " I ask.
    "At seven," says Traddles, looking at his plain old silver watch-the
very watch he once took a wheel out of, at school, to make a water-mill.
 " That is about Miss Wickfield's time, is it not? "
    " A little earlier. Her time is half-past eight."
    " I assure you, my dear boy," says Traddles, "I am almost as pleased
as if I were going to be married myself, to think that this event is coming to
such a happy termination. And really the great friendship and considera-
tion of personally associating Sophy with the joyful occasion, and inviting
her to be a bridesmaid in conjunction with Miss Wickfield, demands my
warmest thanks. I am extremely sensible of it."
    I hear him, and shake hands with him; and we talk, and walk, and
dine, and so on ; but I don't believe it. Nothing is real.
    Sophy arrives at the house of Dora's aunts, in due course. She has the
most agreeable of faces,-not       absolutely beautiful, but extraordinarily
pleasant,-and is one of the most genial, unaffected, frank, engaging
creatures I have ever seen. Traddles presents her to us with great pride ;
and rubs his hands for ten minutes by the clock, with every individual
hair upon his head standing on tiptoe, when I congratulate him in a
corner on his choice.
    I have brought Agnes from the Canterbury coach, and her cheerful
and beautiful face is among us for the second time. Agnes has a great
liking for Traddles, and it is capital to see them meet, and to observe
the glory of Traddles as he commends the dearest girl in the world to
her acquaintance.
    Still I don't believe it. We have a delightful evening, and are supremely
happy; but I don't believe it yet. I can't collect myself. I can't
check off my happiness as it takes place. I feel in a misty and unsettled
kind of state ; as if I had got up very early in the morning a week or two
ago, and had never been to bed since. I can't make out when yesterday
was. I seem to have been carrying the licence about, in my pocket,
many months.
446            THE PERSONIIL HISTORY AND EXPERIESCE

   Next day, too, when we all go in a flock to see the house-our house-
Dora's and mine-I am quite unable to regard myself as its master. I
seem to be there, by permission of somebody else. 1half expect the real
master to come home presently, and say he is glad to see me. Such a
beautiful little house as it is, with everything so bright and new; with the
flowers on the carpets looking as if freshly gathered, and the green leaves
on the paper as if they had just come out; with the spotless muslin
curtains, and the blushing rose-coloured furniture, and Dora's garden hat
with the blue ribbon-do I remember, now, how I loved her in such another
hat when I first knew her !-already hanging on its little peg; the guitar-
case quite at homc on its heels in a corner; and everybody tumbling over
Jip's Pagoda, which is much too big for the establishment.
   Another happy evening, quite as unreal as all the rest of it, and I steal
into the usual room before going away. Dora is not there. I suppose
they have not done trying on yet. Miss Lavinia peeps in, and tells me
mysteriously that she will not be long. She is rather long, notwith-
standing; but by-and-by I hear a rustling at the door, and some
one taps.
   I say, " Come in ! " but some one taps again.
   I go to the door, wondering who it is ; there, I meet a pair of bright eyes,
and a blushing face ; they are Dora's eyes and face, and Miss Lavinia has
dressed her in to-morrow's dress, bonnet and all, for me to see. I take
my little wife to my heart; and Miss Lavinia gives a little scream because
I tumble the bonnet, and Dora laughs and cries at once, because I am so
pleased; and I believe it less than ever.
   "Do you think it pretty, Doady ? " says Dora.
   Pretty ! I should rather think I did.
   " And are you sure you like me very much? " says Dora.
   The topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet, that Miss Lavinia
gives another little scream, and begs me to understand that Dora is only
to be looked at, and on no account to be touched. So Dora stands in a
delightful state of confusion for a minute or two, to be admired; and
then takes off her bonnet-looking so natural without it !-and runs away
with it in her hand; and comes dancing down again in her own familiar
dress, and asks Jip if I have got a beautiful little wife, and whether he '11
forgive her for being married, and kneels down to make him stand upon
the cookery-book, for the last time in her single life.
   I go home, more incredulous than ever, to a lodging that I have hard
by; and get up very early in the morning, to ride to the Highgate road
and fetch my aunt.
   I have never seen my aunt in such state. She is dressed in lavender-
colored silk, and has a white bonnet on, and is amazing. Janet has
dressed her, and is there to look at me. Peggotty is ready to go to church,
intending to behold the ceremony from the gallery. Mr. Dick, who is to
 give my darling to me at the altar, has had his hair curled. Traddles,
whom I have taken up by appointment at the turnpike, presents a dazzling
 combination of cream color and light blue ; and both he and Mr. Dick have
 a general effect about them of being all gloves.
    No doubt I see this, because I know it is so ; but I am astray, and
 seem to see nothing. Nor do I believe anything whatever. Still, as we
                         O F DAYID COPPERFIELD.                           447
drive along in an open carriage, this fairy marriage is real enough to fill
me with a sort of wondering pity for the unfortunate people who have no
part in it, but are sweeping out the shops, and going to their daily
occupations.
   My aunt sits with my hand in hers all the way. When we stop a little
way short of the church, to p ~ l tdown Peggotty, whom we have brought
on the box, she gives it a squeeze, and me a kiss.
   " God bless you, Trot !     My own boy never could be dearer. I think
of poor dear Baby this morning."
   " So do I.     And of all I owc to you, dear aunt."
   '( Tut, child ! " says my aunt ; and gives her hand in overflowing cor-
diality to Traddles, who then gives his to Mr. Dick, who then gives his
to meJ who then give mine to Traddles, and then we come to the church
door.
   The church is calm enough, I am sure ; but it might be a steam-
power loom in full action, for any sedative effect it has on me. I am too
far gone for that.
   The rest is all a more or less incoherent dream.
   A dream of their coming in with Dora; of the pew-opener arranging
us, like a drill-serjeant, before the altar rails ; of my wondering, even then,
why pew-openers must always be the most disagreeable females procurable,
and whether there is any religious dread of a disastrous infection of good-
humour which renders it indispensable to set those vessels of vinegar
upon the road to Heaven.
   Of the clergyman and clerk appearing; of a few boatmen and some
other people strolling in ; of an ancient mariner behind me, strongly
flavoring the church with rum ; of the service beginning in a deep voice,
and our all being very attentive.
   Of Miss Lavinia, who acts as a semi-auxiliary bridesmaid, being the
first to cry, and of her doing homage (as I take it) to the memory of
Pidger, in sobs ; of Miss Clarissa applying a smelling-bottle ; of Agnes
taking care of Dora; of my aunt endeavouring to represent herself as a
model of sternness, with tears rolling down her face; of little Dora
trembling very much, and making her responses in faint whispers.
    Of our kneeling down together, side by side ; of Dora's trembling less
and less, but always clasping Agnes by the hand ; of the service being got
through, quietly and gravely; of our all looking at each other in an April
state of smiles and tears, when it is over; of my young wife being
hysterical in the vestry, and crying for her poor papa, her dear papa.
    Of her soon cheering up again, and our signing the register all round.
Of my going into the gallery for Peggotty to bring her to sign i t ; of
Peggotty's hugging me in a corner, and telling me she saw my own dear
mother married ; of its being over, and our going away.
    Of my walking so proudly and lovingly down the aisle with my sweet
wife upon my arm, through a mist of half-seen people, pulpits, monu-
ments, pews, fonts, organs, and church windows, in which there flutter
faint airs of association with my childish church at home, so long ago.
    Of their whispering, as we pass, what a youthful couple we are, and
what a pretty little wife she is. Of our dl being so merry and
talkative in the carriage going back. Of Sophy telling us that when she
448           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

saw Traddles (whom I had entrusted with the licence) asked for it, she
almost fainted, having been convinced that he would contrive to lose it,
or to have his pocket picked. Of Agnes laughing gaily ; and of Dora
being so fond of Agnes that she will not be separated from her, but still
keeps her hand.
   Of there being a breakfast, with abundance of things, pretty and sub-
stantial, to eat and drink, whereof I partake, as I should do in any
other dream, without the least perception of their flavor; eating and
drinking, as I may say, nothing but love and marriage, and no more
believing in the viands than in anything else.
   Of my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion, without having
an idea of what I want to say, beyond such as may be compre-
hended in the full conviction that I haven't said it. Of our being very
sociably and simply happy (always in a dream though); and of Jip's
having wedding cake, and its not agreeing with him afterwards.
   Of the pair of hired post-horses being ready, and of Dora's going away to
change her dress. Of my aunt and Miss Clarissa remaining with us; and
our walking in the garden ; and my aunt, who has made quite a speech
at breakfast touching Dora's aunts, being mightily amused with herself,
but a little proud of it loo.
   Of Dora's being ready, and of Miss Lavinia's hovering about her, loth
to lose the pretty toy that has given her so much pleasant occupation. Of
Dora's making a long series of surprised discoveries that she has forgotten
all sorts of little things ; and of everybody's running everywhere to
fetch them.
   Of their all closing about Dora, when at last she begins to say good-
bye, loolting, with their bright colors and ribbons, like a bed of flowers.
Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers, and coming
out, laughing and crying both together, to my jealous arms.
   Of my wanting to carry Jip (who is to go along with us), and Dora's
saying no, that she must carry him, or else he'll think she don't like him
any more, now she is married, and will break his heart. Of our going,
arm in arm, and Dora stopping and looking back, and saying, " If I have
ever been cross or ungrateful to anybody, don't remember it ! " and
bursting into tears.
   Of her waving her little hand, and our going away once more. Of her
once more stopping, and looking back, and hurrying to Agnes, and giving
Agnes, above all the others, her last kisses and farewells.
   We drive away together, and I awake from the dream. I believe it at
last. I t is my dear, dear, little wife beside me, whom I love so well !
  Gc Are you happy now, you foolish boy? " says Dora, "and sure you
don't repent ? "

  I have stood aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me.
They are gone, and I resume the journey of my story.
      THE POWDERED-HEADED GENTLEMAN.

  I S C A R C E need tell, what ev'ry one must know,             The cloth was elegant, the style "all right''
  That powder'd heads wt3rcone time "all the go: "                (To use the homely phrase of Mr. Whltej)
  Such wa9 Ihc case: and not to have a snuw head                 And so delighted was the powder'd man
  Was almost tantamount to having no head.                        Wlth garments made on such a first-rate plan,
  I n fact, a man without a dusty " n a b ''                     That he began to fear that powder'd haw
  Was scarce view'd higher than a ' I Dusty Bob."                Would be a most destructive thlng to wear.
  But heads no loneer are with oowder loaded.                    " Thls coat (thought he,) is far too good to spoll,
  The powder-box Las now, lank slnce, exploded.                  Suppose I change my powder Into 011."

     HY D R O P A T H I C E S T A B L I S H M E N T ,
                      SUDBROOK PARK, NEAR RICHMOND, SURREY.

    THISInstitution, which has been in full and successful operation for eight years, is conducted by JAMES
ELLIS,    M.D., who resides in the house, and has thus the opportunity of exercising a constant superintend-
ence of the treatment.
   His own experience during a practice of eight years, part of which he was a coadjutor of Dr. Weiss,
enables him confidently to assert, that all diseases curable, and many incurable by any previoosly known
means, can be safely and successfully treated by a proper application of the Water Cure alone.
   Sudbrook Park adjoins Richmond Park on its southern and sheltered side, and contains upwards of a
hundred acres. I t is richly wooded, and the pleasure grounds are extensive and beautiful, containing
many appliances for the recreation and exercise of the patients. I t is also within five minutes' walk of
the most beautiful part of the river Thames, which is accessible for the amusements of boating and fishing.
   B y special permission of the Queen, there is also a private access to the Royal Park of Richmond.
    The air is celebrated for its purity, and the soil heing composed of gravel, is peculiarly dry and healthy,
allowing the exercise of walking at all seasons.
    The Mansion is admirably adapted for the purpose, the rooms being lofty and spacious. I t was formerly
the residence of the Dukes of Argyll and Buccleuch.
    The domestic arrangements, superintended by Mrs. ELLIS,are on a complete and liberal scale.
    The house is abundantly supplied with the purest water, including, among otber sources, the celebrated
 Silver spring which takes its rise in Richmond Park," and the Plunge Baths, Douches, &c., are fitted up
in the most complete manner.
    I t is believed that the improvements made during the past winter have rendered this Establishment one
 of the most comulete in Europe.
    Strangers desirous of inspecting the Mansion, Baths, Douches, Pleasure Grounds, Park, &c., are
 admitted on Wednesdays, from 10 till 4 o'clock, by cards only, which may he obtained of Mr. TRELAWNEY

W E take this opportunity of announcing a design closely associated with our Household Words, which we have
      now matured, and which we hope will be acceptable to o m readers.
      W e propose publishing, a t the end of each month, as a Supplementary Number to the monthly part of
 "HOUSEHOLD WORDS," a comprehensive Abstract or History of all the occurrences of that month, native and
 foreign, under the title of THEHOUSEHOLD         NARRATIVE  OR CURRENT   EVENTS.
      The size and price of each of these numbers will be the same as the size and price of a single number of
 "HOUSEHOLD WORDS:'               Twelve nombers will necessarily be published in the course of the year--one for
 each month-and on the completion of the Annual Volume, a copious Index will appear and a title-page for the
 volume, which will then be called THE HOUSEHOLD          NARRATIVE   of such a year. I t will form a complete Chronicle
 of all that year's events carefully compiled thoroughly digested, and systematically arranged for easy reference
 presenting a vast mass df information that g u s t be interesting to all, a t a price that will render i t accessible td
 the humblest purchasers of books, a t which only our existing machineryin connexion with our Weekly Miscella~ly
would enable us to produce it.
      The first number of THE HOUSEHOLD           NARRATNE   will appear as a Supplement to the first monthly part of
 "HOUSEHOLD WORDS,'' published a t the end of the present month of APRIL. AS the Volume for 1850
wolild be incomplete (in consequence of our not having commenced this publication a t the beginning of a year)
without a backwa1.d reference to the three months of JANUARY          FEBRUARY,   and MAR~H,    a similar number of THE
I I o u s e ~ NARRATIVE
               o~~         for each of those months will be published before the year is out.
     I t is scarcely necessary to explain that ii is not proposed to render the purchase of THE HOUSEHOLD
NARKATIVE     compulsory on the purchasers of IIOUSEHOLD WORDS;" and that the Supplen~entaryNumber,
though always published a t the same time as obr Monthly Part, will therefore be detached from it, and published
separately.
     Nor is it necessary for us we believe to expatiate on our leading reasons for adding this new undertaking to
our present enterprise. ~ h e ' i n t i m a t ecdnnexion between the facts and realities of the time, and the means by
which we aim in "HOUSEHOLD WORDS," to soften what is hard in them, to exalt what i s held in little
consideration, 'and to show the latent hope there is in what may seem unpromising, needs not be pointed out.
All that we songht to express in our Preliminary Word, in reference to this work, applies, we think, to its
proposed companion. As another humble means of enabling those who accept us for their friend, to bear the
world's rough-cast events to the anvil of courageous duty, and there beat them into a shape, we enter on the
project, and confide in its success.

                           CHAPTER XLIV.
                           OUR HOUSEKEEPING.

    ITwas a strange condition of things, the honey-moon being over, and
 the bridesmaids gone home, when I found myself sitting down in my own
 small house with Dora; quite thrown out of employment, as I may say,
 in respect of the delicious old occupation of malting love.
    I t seemed such an extraordinary thing to have Dora always there. I t
 was so unaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her, not to have
 any occasion to be tormenting myself about her, not to have to write to
 her, not to be scheming and devising opportunities of being alone with her.
 Sometimes of an evening, when I looked up from my writing, and saw
her seated opposite, I would lean back in my chair, and think how queer
it was that there we were, alone together as a matter of conrse-nobody's
busiriens any more-all the romance of our engagement put away upon a
 shelf, to rust-no one to please but one another-one another to please,
for life.
    When there was a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so
strange to me, as I was walking home, to think that Dora mas at home !
I t was such a wonderful thing, at first, to have her coming softly down to
talk to me as I ate my supper. I t was such a stupendous thing to know
for certain that she put her hair in papers. It was altogether such an
astonishing event to see her do it !
    I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping
house, than I and my pretty Dora did. Mre had a servant, of course. She
kept house for us. I have still a latent belief that she must have been
Mrs. Crupp's daughter in disguise, we had such an awful time of it with
Mary Anne.
    Her name was Paragon. Her nature was represented to us, when we
engaged her, as being feebly expressed in her name. She had a written
character, as large as a proclamation; and, according to this document,
could do cvcrything of a domestic nature that ever I heard of, and a great
many things that I never did hear of. She was a woman in the prime of
life ; of a severe countenance ; and subject (particularly in the arms) to a
sort of perpetual measles or fiery rash. She had a cousin in the Life
Guards, with such long legs that he looked like the afternoon shadow of
somebody else. His shell-jacket was as much too little for him as he was
too big for the premises. He made the cottage smaller than it need have
been, by being so very much out of proportion to it. Besides which, the
walls were not thick, and whenever he passed the evening at our house,
n7e always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen.
    Our treasure was warranted sober and honest. I am therefore willing
to believe that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler; and
that the deficient teaspoons were attributable to the dustman.
   But she p r e ~ e dupon our minds dreadfully. We felt our inexperience,

450           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 and were unable to help ourselves. We should have been at her mercy,
if she had had any ; but she was a remorseless woman, and had none. She
 was the cause of our first little quarrel.
    "My dearest life," I said one day to Dora, "do you think Mary Anne
has any idea of time ? "
    "Why, Doady? " inquired Dora, looking up, innocently, from her
drawing.
      My love, because it's five, and we were to have dined at four."
   Dora glanced wistfully at the clock, and hinted that she thought it was
too fast.
   " On the contrary, my love," said I, referring to my watch, " it 's a few
minutes too slow."
   My little wife came and sat upon my knee, to coax me to be quiet,
and drew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose; but I
couldn't dine off that, thongh it was very agreeable.
   "Don't you think, my dear," said I, " i t would be better for you to
remonstrate with Mary Anne ? "
   " Oh no, please ! I couldn't, Doady ! "said Dora.

   " Why not, my love ? " I gently asked.

   " Oh, because I am such a little goose," said Dora, " and she knows

I am!"
   I thought this sentiment so incompatible wit11 the establishment of any
system of check on Mary Anne, that I frowned a little.
   " Oh, what ugly wrinkles in my bad boy's forehead ! " said Dora, and
still being on my knee, she traced them with her pencil; putting it to her
rosy lips to make it mark blacker, and working at my forehead with a
quaint little mockery of being industrious, that quite delighted me in
spite of myself.
   " There 's a good child," said Dora, " it makes its face so much prettier

to laugh."
   " But, my love," said I.
   " No, no ! please ! " cried Dora, with a kiss, " don't be a naughty Blue
Beard ! Don't be serious !"
   " My precious wife," said I, " we must be serious sometimes.       Come !
Sit down on this chair, close beside me ! Give me the pencil ! There !
Now let us talk sensibly. You know, dear;" what a little hand it was to
hold, and what a tiny wedding-ring it was to see! "You know, my lore,
it is not exactly comfortable to have to go out without one's dinner.
Now, is it ? "
   " N-n-no      ! " replied Dora, faintly.
   " My love, how you tremble ! "

   "Because I KNOW you're going to scold me," exclaimed Dora, in a
piteous voice.
   " My sweet, I am only going to reason."
   " Oh, but reasoning is worse than scolding ! " exclaimed Dora, in
despair. " I didn't marry to be reasoned with. If you meant to reason
with such a poor little thing as I am, you ought to have told me so, you
cruel boy ! "
   I tried to pacify Dora, but she turned away her face, and shook her
curls from side to side, and said "You cruel, cruel boy ! " so many times,
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            451
that I really did not exactly know what to do: so I took a few turns
up and down the room in my uncertainty, and came back again.
   " Dora, my darling ! "
   "No, I am not your darling. Because you ?nust be sorry that you
married me, or else you wouldn't reason with me ! " returned Dora.
   I felt so injured by the inconsequential nature of this charge, that it
gave me courage to be grave.
   "Now, my own Dora," said I, "you are very childish, and are talking
nonsense. You must remember, I am sure, that I was obliged to go out
yesterday when dinner was half over; and that, the day before, I was
made quite unwell by being obliged to eat underdone veal in a hurry;
to-day, I don't dine at all-and I am afraid to say how long we waited for
breakfast-and      then the water didn't boil. I don't mean to reproach
you, my dear, but this is not comfortable."
   " Oh, you cruel, cruel boy, to say I am a disagreeable wife ! " criedDora.
   "Now my dear Dora, you must know that I never said that ! "
   " You said I wasn't comfortable ! " said Dora.
   " I said the housekeeping was not comfortable."
   " It's exactly the same thing ! " cried Dora. And she evidently
thought so, for she wept most grievously.
   I took another turn across the room, full of love for my pretty wife,
and distracted by self-accusatory inclinations to knock my head against
the door. I sat down again, and said :
   " I am not blaming you, Dora. We have both a great deal to learn.
I am only trying to show you, my dear, that you must-you really must"
(I was resolved not to give this up)-"accustom yourself to look after
Mary Anne. Likewise to act a little for yourself, and me."
   " I wonder, I do, at your making such ungrateful speeches," sobbed

Dora. "When you know that the other day, when you said you would
like a little bit of fish, I went out myself, miles and miles, and ordered it,
to surprise yon."
   "And it was very kind of you, my own darling," said I. " I felt it so
much that I wouldn't on any account have even mentioned that you
bought a Salmon-which was too much for two. Or that it cost one pound
six-which was more than we can afford."
   "You enjoyed it very much," sobbed Dora. "And you said I was
a Mouse."
   "And I'll say so again, my love," I returned, " a thousand times ! "
   But I had wounded Dora's soft little heart, and she was not to be
comforted. She was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing, that I felt
as if I had said I don't know what to hurt her. I was obliged to hurry
away; I was kept out late ; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as
made me miserable. I had the conscience of an assassin, and was haunted
by a vague sense of enormous wickedness.
   I t was two or three hours past midnight when I got home. I found
my aunt, in our house, sitting up for me.
   " I s anything the matter, aunt ? " said I, alarmed.

   " Nothing, Trot," she replied. " Sit down, sit down. Little Blossom
 has been rather out of spirits, and I have been keeping her company.
That's all."
452           THE PE~LSONALHISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   I leaned my head upon my hand; and felt niore sorry and downcast, as
I sat looking at the fire, than I could have supposed possible so soon
after the fulfilment of my brightest hopes. As I sat thinking, I happened
to meet my aunt's eyes, which were resting on my face. There ~vasan
anxious expression in them, but it cleared directly.
   " I assure you, aunt," said I, " I have been quite unhappy myself all
night, to think of Dora's being so. But I had no other intention than to
speak to her tenderly and lovingly about our home-affairs."
   My aunt nodded encouragement.
   " You must have patience, Trot," said she.

   " Of course. Heaven knows I don't mean to be unreasonable, aunt ! "
   "No, no," said my aunt. " But Little Blossom is a very tender little
blossom, and the wind must be gentle with her."
   I thanked my good aunt, in my heart, for her tenderness towards my
wife ; and I was sure that she knew I did.
   "Don't you think, aunt," said I, after some further contemplation of
the fire, " that you could advise and counsel Dora a little, for our mutual
advantage, now and then ? "
   " Trot," returned my aunt, with some emotion, " no ! Don't ask me
such a thing ! "
   Her tone was so very earnest that I raised my eyes in surprise.
   " I look back on my life, child," said my aunt, " and I think of some

who are in their graves, with whom I might have been on kinder terms.
If I judged harshly of other people's mistakes in marriage, it may have
been because I had bitter reason to judge harshly of my own. Let that
 pass. I have been a grumpy, frumpy, wayward sort of a woman, a good
many years. I am still, and I always shall be. But you and I have done
 one another some good, Trot,-at all events, you have done me good, my
 dear; and division must not come between us, at this time of day."
   " Division between us !"   cried I.
   " Child, child ! " said my aunt, smoothing her dress, "how soon it
might come between us, or how unhappy I might make our Little Blossom,
if I meddled in anything, a prophet couldn't say. I want our pet to
like me, and be as gay as a butterfly. Remember your own home, in
that second marriage ; and never do both me and her the injury you have
hinted at ! "
   I comprehended, at once, that my aunt was right ; and I comprehended
the f ~ d extent
          l      of her generous feeling towards my dear wife.
   " These are early days, Trot," she pursued, " and Rome was not built
in a day, nor in a year. You have chosen freely for yourself;" a cloud
passed over her face for a moment, I thought; " and you have chosen a
very pretty and a very affectionate creature. I t will be your duty, and it
will be your pleasure too-of course I know that; I am not delivering a
lecture-to estimate her (as yon chose her) by the qualities she has, and
not by the qualities she may not have. The latter you must develop in
her, if you can. And if you cannot, child," here my aunt rubbed her nose,
"you must just accustom yourself to do without 'em. But remember,
my dear, your future is between yon two. No one can assist you; you
are to work it out for yourselves. This is marriage, Trot; and Heaven
bless you both, in it, for a pair of babes in the wood as you are ! "
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          463
    My aunt said this in a sprightly way, and gave me a kiss to ratify the
blessing.
    "Now," said she, " light my little lantern, and see me into my band-
box by the garden path;" for there was a communication between our
cottages in that direction. " Give Betsey Trotwood's love to Blossom,
when you come back; and whatever you do, Trot, never dream of setting
Betsey up as a scarecrow, for if I ever saw her in the glass, she's quite
grim enough and gaunt enough in her private capacity ! "
    TiVitli this my aunt tied her head up in a handkerchief, with which she
was accustomed to make a bundle of it on such occasions ; and I escorted
her home. ils she stood in her garden, holding up her little lantern to
light me back, I thought her observation of me had an anxious air again;
but I was too much occupied in pondering on what she had said, and
too much impressed-for the first time, in reality-by the conviction that
Dora and I had indeed to work out our future for ourselves, and that no
one could assist us, to take much notice of it.
    Dora came stealing down in her little slippers, to meet me, now that
I was alone; and cried upon my shoulder, and said I had been hard-
hearted and she had been naughty; and I said much the same thing in
effect, I believe; and we made it up, and agreed that our first little
difference was to be our last, and that we were never to have another if
we lived a hundred years.
    The next domestic trial we went through, was the Ordeal of Servants.
Mary Anne's cousin deserted into our coal-hole, and was brought out, to
our great amazement, by a piquet of his companions in arms, who took
him away handcuffed in a procession that covered our front-garden with
ignominy. This nerved me to get rid of Mary Anne, who went so mildly,
on receipt of wages, that I was surprised, until I found out about the
tea-spoons, and also about the little sums she had borrowed in my
name of the tradespeople without authority. After an interval of Mrs.
Kidgerbury-the oldest inhabitant of Kentish Town, 1believe, who went
O L L ~charing, but was too feeble to execute her conceptions of that art-we
found another treasure, who was one of the most amiable of women, but
who generally made a point of falling either up or down the kitchen stairs
with the tray, and almost always plunged into the parlor, as into a bath,
with the tea-things. The ravages committed by this unfortunate, render-
ing her dismissalnecessary, she was succeeded (withintervals of Mrs. Kid-
gerbury) by a long line of Incapables; terminating in a young person of
genteel appearance, who went to Greenwich Fair in Dora's bonnet. After
whom I remember nothing but an average equality of failure.
    Everybody we had anything to do with seemed to cheat us. Our
appearance in a shop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought
out immediately. If we bought a lobster, it was full of water. All our
meat turned out to be tough, and there was hardly any crust to our
loaves. I n search of the principle on which joints ought to be roasted, to
be roasted enough, and not too much, I myself referred to the Cookery
Book, and found it there established as the allowance of a quarter of an
hour to every pound, and say a quarter over. But the principle always
failed us by some curious fatality, and we never could hit any medium
 between redness and cinders.
454            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     I had reason to believe that in accomplishing these failures we incurred
 a far greater expense than if we had achieved a series of triumphs. I t
 appeared to me, on looking over the tradesmen's books, as if we inight
 have kept the basement story paved with butter, such was the extensive
 scale of our consumption of that article. I don't know whether the
Excise returns of the period may have exhibited any increase in the demand
for pepper ; but if our performances did not affect the market, I should say
several families must have left off' using it. And the most wonderful fact
of all was, that we never had anything in the house.
     As to the washerwoman pawning the clothes, and coming in a state of
penitent intoxication to apologise, I suppose that might have happened
several times to anybody. Also the chimney on fire, the parish engine, and
perjury on the part of the Beadle. But I apprehend that we were personally
unfortunate in engaging a servant with a taste for cordials, who swelled
our running account for porter at the public-house by such inexplica-
ble items as " quartern rum shrnb (Mrs. C.)" " Half-quartern gin and
cloves (Mrs. C.)" " Glass rum and peppermint (Mrs. C.)"-the             paren-
thesis alwaj~s referring to Dora, who was supposed, it appeared on
explanation, to have imbibed the whole of these refreshments.
     One of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little dinner to
Traddles. I met him in town, and asked him to walk out with me that
afternoon. 13e readily consenting, I wrote to Dora, saying I would
bring him home. I t was pleasant weather, and on the road we made my
domestic happiness the theme of conversation. Traddles was very full of
i t ; and said, that, picturing himself with such a home, and Sophy waiting
and preparing for him, he could think of nothing wanting to complete
his bliss.
     I could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the opposite end of
the table, but I certainly could have wished, when we sate down, for a
little more room. I did not know how it was, but though there were
only two of us, we were at once always cramped for room, and yet had
always room enough to lose everything in. I suspect it may have been
because nothing had a place of its own, except Jip's pagoda, which
invariably blocked up the main thoroughfare. On the present occasion,
Traddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda and the gnitar-case, and
Dora's flover-painting, and my writing-table, that I had serious doubts of
the possibility of his using his knife and fork ; but he protested, with his
own good-humour, " Oceans of room, Copperfield ! I assure you,
Oceans ! "
    There was another thing I could have wished, namely, that Jip had
never been encouraged to walk about the table-cloth during dinner. I
began to think there was something disorderly in his being there at all,
even if he had not been in the habit of putting his foot in the salt or the
melted butter. On this occasion he seemed to think he was introduced
expressly to keep Traddles at bay ; and he barked at my old friend, and
made short runs at his plate, with such undaunted pertinacity, that he
may be said to have engrossed the conversation.
    However, as I knew how tender-hearted my dear Dora was, and how
sensitive she would be to any slight upon her favorite, I hinted no
objection. For similar reasons I made no allusion to the skirmishing
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          455
 plates upon the floor; or to the disreputable appearance of the castors,
 which were all at sixes and sevens, and looked drunk ; or to the further
 blockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs. I could
 not help wondering in my own mind, as I contemplated the boiled leg of
 mutton before me, previous to carving it, how it came to pass that our
 joints of meat were of such extraordinary shapes-and whether our butcher
 contracted for all the deformed sheep that came into the world ; but I kept
 my reflections to myself.
    " My love," said I to Dora, "what have you got in that dish? "

    I could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at
 me, as if she wanted to kiss me.
    " Oysters, dear," said Dora, timidly.
    " Was that yozcr thought ? " said I, delighted.
    " Ye-yes, Doady," said Dora.
    "There never was a happier one! " I exclaimed, laying down the
carving-knife and fork. " There is nothing Traddles likes so much ! "
    " Ye-yes, Doady," said Dora, " and so I bought a beautiful little barrel
of them, and the man said they were very good. But 1-1 am afraid
there 's something the matter with them. They don't seem right." Here
Dora shook her head, and diamonds twinkled in her eyes.
    " They are only opened in both shells," said I.   "Take the top one off,
my love."
    " But it won't come off," said Dora, trying very hard, and looking very
much distressed.
    " Do you know, Copperfield," said Traddles, cheerfully examining the

dish, " I think it is in consequelice-they are capital oysters, but I thilzk
it is in consequence-of their never having been opened."
   They never had been opened ; and we had no oyster-knives-and couldn't
have used them if we had ; so we looked at the oysters and ate the mutton.
At least we ate as much of it as was done, and made up with capers. If
I had permitted him, I am satisfied that Traddles would have made a
perfect savage of himself, and eaten a plateful of raw meat, to express
enjoyment of the repast; but I would hear of no such immolation on the
altar of friendship, and we had a course of bacon instead; there happening,
by good fortune, to be cold bacon in the larder.
   My poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought I should be
annoyed, and in such a state of joy when she found I was not, that the
discomfiture I had subdued, very soon vanished, and we passed a happy
evening; Dora sitting with her arm on my chair while Traddles and I
discussed a glass of wine, and taking every opportunity of whispering in
my ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel, cross old boy. By
and bye she made tea for us ; which it was so pretty to see her do, as if
she were busying herself with a set of doll's tea-things, that I was not
particular about the quality ofthe beverage. Then Traddles and I played
a game or two at cribbage ; and Dora singing to the guitar the while, it
seemed to me as if our courtship and marriage were a tender dream of
mine, and the night when I first listened to her voice were not yet
over.
   When Traddles went away, and I came back into the parlor from seeing
him out, my wife planted her chair close to mine, and sat down by my side.
456           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   "I am very sorry," she said. " Will you try to teach me, Doady ? "
   "I must teach myself first, Dora," said I. " I am as bad as you,
love."
   "Ah ! But you can learn," she returned ; " and you are a clever, clever
man ! "
   " Nonsense, mouse ! " said I.

   "I wish," resumed my wife, after a long silence, "that I could have
gone down into the country for a whole year, and lived with Agnes ! "
   Her hands were clasped upon my shoulder, and her chin rested on them,
and her blue eyes looked quietly into mine.
   " Why so ? " I asked.

   " I think she might have improved me, and I think I might have learnt
from her," said Dora.
   "All in good time, my love. Agnes has had her father to take care of
for these many years, you should remember. Even when she was quite a
child, she was the Agnes whom we know," said I.
   " Will you call me a name I want you to call me? " inquired Dora,

without moving.
   " What is i t ? " I asked with a smile.

   " I t ' s a stupid name," she said, shaking her curls for a moment.
" Child-wife."
   I laughingly asked my child-wife what her fancy was in desiring to be
so called? She answered without moving, otherwise than as the arm I
twined about her may have brought her blue eyes nearer to me :
   " I don't mean, you silly fellow, that you should use the name, instead

of Dora. I only mean that you should think of me that way. When you
are going to be angry with me, say to yourself, ' it's only my child-wife ! '
When I am very disappointing, say, ' I knew, a long time ago, that she
would make but a child-wife ! ' When you miss what I should like to be,
and I think can never be, say, ' still my foolish child-wife loves me !' For
indeed I do."
   I had not been serious with her ; having no idea, untilnow, that she was
serious herself. But her affectionate nature was so happy in what I now
said to her with my whole heart, that her face became a laughing one
before her glittering eyes were dry. She was soon my child-wife indeed;
sitting down on the floor outside the Chinese House, ringing all the little
bells one after another, to punish Jip for his recent bad behaviour ; while
Jip lay blinking in the doorway with his head out, even too lazy to be
teased.
   This appeal of Dora's made a strong impression on me. I look back on
the time I write of; I invoke the innocent figure that I dearly loved, to
come out from the mists and shadows of the past, and turn its gentle
head towards me once again; and I can still declare that this one little
speech was constantly in my memory. I may not have used it to the best
account ; I was young and inexperienced ; but I never turned a deaf ear
to its artless pleading.
   Dora told me, shortly afterwards, that she was going to be a wonderful
housekeeper. Accordingly, she polished the tablets, pointed the pencil,
bought an immense account-book, carefully stitched up with a needle and
thread all the leaves of the Cookery-Book which Jip had torn, and made
                        OF DAVID COPPEPFIELD.                          $57
 quite a desperate little attempt "to be good," as she called it. But the
 figures had the old obstinate propensity-they zoould lzot add up. When
she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book, Jip
would walk over the page, wagging his tail, and smear them all out. Her
own little right-hand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink ;
and I think that was the only decided result attained.
    Sometimes, of an evening, when I was at home and at work-for I
wrote a good deal now, and was beginning in a small way to be known as
a writer-I would lay down my pen, and watch my child-wife trying to be
good. First of all, she would bring out the immense account-book, and
lay it down upon the table, with a deep sigh. Then she would open it
at the place where Jip had made it illegible last night, and call Jip up, to
look at his misdeeds. This would occasion a diversion in Jip's favour,
and some inking of his nose, perhaps, as a penalty. Then she would tell
Jip to lie down on the table mstantly, "like a lion "-which was one of
his tricks, though I cannot say the likeness was striking-and, if he were
in an obedient humor, he would obey. Then she would take up a pen,
and begin to write, and find a hair in it. Then she would take up another
pen, and begin to write, and find that it spluttered. Then she would take
up another pen, and begin to write, and say in a low voice, " Oh, it's a
talking pen, and will disturb Doady ! " And then she would give it up as a
bad job, and put the account-book away, after pretending to crush the
lion with it.
    Or, if she were in a very sedate and serious state of mind, she w o ~ ~ l d
sit down with the tablets, and a little basket of bills and other documents,
which looked more like curl-papers than anything else, and endeavour to
get some result out of them. After severely comparing one with another,
and making entries on the tablets, and blotting them out, and counting all
the fingers of her left hand over and over again, backwards and forwards,
she would be so vexed and discouraged, and would look so unhappy, that
it gave me pain to see her bright face clouded-and for me!-and I
would go softly to her, and say:
    "What's the matter, Dora? "
    Dora would look up hopelessly, and reply, "They won't come right.
They make my head ache so. And they won't do anything I want ! "
    Then I would say, "Now let us try together. Let me show you,
Dora."
    Then I would commence a practical demonstration, to which Dora
would pay profound attention, perhaps for five minutes ; when she would
begin to be dreadfully tired, and would lighten the subject by curling my
hair, or trying the effect of my face with my shirt collar turned down.
If I tacitly checked this playfulness, and persisted, she would look so scared
and disconsolate, as she became more and more bewildered, that the
remembrance of her natural gaiety when I first strayed into her path, and
of her being my child-wife, would come reproachfully upon me ; and I
would lay the pencil down, and call for the guitar.
    I had a great deal of work to do, and had many anxieties, but the
same considerations made me keep them to myself. I am far from sure,
now, that it was right to do this, but I did it for my child-wife's
sake. I search my breast, and I commit its secrets, if I know them,
458           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

without any reservation to this paper. The old unhappy loss or want
of something had, I am conscious, some place in my heart; but
not to the embitterment of my life. When I walked alone in the fine
weather, and thought of the summer days when all the air had been
filled with my boyish enchantment, I did miss something of the reali-
sation of my dreams; but I thought it was a softened glory of the
Past, which nothing could have thrown upon the present time. I did feel,
sometimes, for a little while, that I could have wished my wife had been
my counsellor; had had more character and purpose, to sustain me and
improve me by; had been endowed with power to fill up the void which
somewhere seemed to be about me ; but I felt as if this were an unearthly
consummation of my happiness, that never had been meant to be, and
never could have been.
    I was a boyish husband as to years. I had known the softening
influence of no other sorrows or experiences than those recorded in
these leaves. If I did any wrong, as I may have done much, I did it in
mistaken love, and in my want of wisdom. I write the exact truth. I t
would avail me nothing to extenuate it now.
    Thus it was that I took upon myself the toils and cares of our life,
and had no partner in them. We lived much as before, in reference to
our scrambling household arrangements ; but I had got used to those,
and Dora I was pleased to see was seldom vexed now. She was bright
and cheerful in the old childish way, loved me dearly, and was happy with
her old trifles.
    When the debates were heavy-I mean as to length, not quality, for in
the last respect they were not often otherwise-and I went home late,
Dora would never rest when she heard my footsteps, but would always
come down stairs to meet me. When my evenings were unoccupied by
the pursuit for which I had qualified myself with so much pains, and 1
was engaged in writing at home, she would sit quietly near me, however
late the hour. and be so mute. that I would often think she had dronned
asleep. But generally, when I raised my head, I saw her blue eyes loo'k'ing
at me with the quiet attention of which I have already spoken.
    " Oh, what a weary boy ! " said Dora one night, when I met her eyes
as I was shutting up my desk.
    "What a weary girl ! " said I. " That's more to the purpose. You
must go to bed another time, my love. I t ' s far too late for you."
    "No, don't send me to bed ! " pleaded Dora, coming to my side
"Pray don't do that ! "
   "Dora ! "
   To my amazement she was sobbing on my neck.
   "Not well, my dear! not happy! "
   " Yes ! quite well, and very happy ! " said Dora. "But say you 'll
let me stop, and see you write."
   "Why, what a sight for such bright eyes at midnight ! " I replied.
   "Are they bright, though ? " returned Dora, laughing. " I 'm so glad
they 're bright."
   " Little Vanity ! " said I.

   But it was not vanity; it was only harmless delight in my admiration.
I knew that very well, before she told me so.
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   "If you think them pretty, say I may always stop, and see you write !"
said Dora. "Do you think them pretty ? "
   "Very pretty."
   "Then let me always stop and see you write."
   "I am afraid that won't improve their brightness, Dora."
   "Yes it will! Because, you clever boy, you'll not forget me then,
while you are full of silent fancies. Will you mind it, if I say something
very, very silly ?-more than usual? " inquired Dora, peeping over my
shoulder into my face.
   "What wonderful thing is that ? " said I.
   " Please let me hold the pens," said Dora. "1 want to have something
to do with all those many hours when you are so industrious. May
I hold the pens ? "
   The remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes, brings tears into
my eyes. The next time I sat down to write, and regularly afterwards, she
sat in her old place with a spare bundle of pens at her side. Her triumph in
this connexion with my work, and her delight when I wanted a new pen-
which I very often feigned to do-suggested to me a new way of pleasing
my child-wife. I occasionally made a pretence of wanting a page or two
of manuscript copied. Then Dora was in her glory. The preparations
she made for this great work, the aprons she put on, the bibs she bor-
rowed from the kitchen to keep off the ink, the time she took, the
innumerable stoppages she made to have a laugh with Jip as if he under-
stood it all, her conviction that her work was incomplete unless she
signed her name at the end, and the way in which she would bring it to
me, like a school-copy, and then, when I praised it, clasp me ronnd the
neck, are touching recollections to me, simple as they might appear to
other men.
   She took possession of the keys soon after this, and went jingling
about the house with the whole bunch in a little basket, tied to her
slender waist. I seldom found that the places to which they belonged
were locked, or that they were of any use except as a plaything for Jip-
but Dora was pleased, and that pleased me. She was quite satisfied that
a good deal was effected by this make-belief of housekeeping ; and was as
merry as if we had been keeping a baby-house, for a joke.
    So we went on. Dora was hardly less affectionate to my aunt than to
me, and often told her of the time when she was afraid she was " a cross
 old thing." I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone.
 She courted Jip, though Jip never responded; listened, day after day, to
the guitar, though I am afraid she had no taste for music ; never attacked
the Incapables, though the temptation must have been severe; went
 wonderful distances on foot to purchase, as surprises, any trifles that she
 found out Dora wanted; and never came in by the garden, and missed
 her from the room, but she would call out, at the foot of the stairs, in a
 voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house :
    "n'here's Little Blossom ! "
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                           CHAPTER XLV.
              MR. DICK FULFILS MY AUNT'S PREDICTION.

   IT was some time now, since I had left the Doctor. Living in his
neighbonrhood, I saw him frequently; and we all went to his house on
two or three occasions to dinner or tea. The Old Soldier was in perma-
nent quarters under the Doctor's roof. She was exactly the same as ever,
and the same immortal butterflies hovered over her cap.
   Like some other mothers, whom I have known in the course of my life,
Mrs. Markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was. She
required a great deal of amusement, and, like a deep old soldier, pretended,
in consulting her own inclinations, to be devoting herself to her child.
The Doctor's desire that Annie should be entertained, was therefore
particularly acceptable to this excellent parent ; who expressed unqualified
approval of his discretion.
   I have no doubt, indeed, that she probed the Doctor's wound with-
out knowing it. Meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and
selfishness, not always inseparable from full-blown years, I think she
confirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his young wife,
and that there was no congeniality of feeling between them, by so strongly
commending his design of lightening the load of her life.
   " &fy dear soul,'' she said to him one day when I was present, "you

know there is no doubt it would be a little pokey for Annie to be always
shut up here."
   The Doctor nodded his benevolent head.
   "When she comes to her mother's age," said Mrs. Marlrleham, with a
flourish of her fan, "then, it '11 be another thing. You might put M E
into a Jail, with genteel society and a rubber, and I should never care to
come out. But I am not Annie, you know ; and Annie is not her mother."
   " Surely, surely," said the Doctor.
   " You are the best of creatures-no, I beg your pardon ! " for the Doctor
made a gesture of depreciation, " I must say before your face, as I always
say behind your back, you are the best of creatures ; but of course you don't
-now do you ?-enter into the same pursuits and fancies as Annie ? "
   " No," said the Doctor, in a sorrowful tone.

   "No, of course not," retorted the Old Soldier. " Take your Dictionary
for example. What a useful worlr a Dictionary is ! What a necessary
work! The meanings of words ! Without Doctor Johnson, or somebody
of that sort, we might have been at this present moment calling an Italian-
iron a bedstead. But we can't expect a Dictionary-especially when it's
making-to interest Annie, can we? "
   The Doctor shoolr his head.
   " And that's why I so much approve," said Mrs. Markleham, tapping
him on the shoulder with her shut-up fan, "of your thoughtfulness. It
 shows that you don't expect, as many elderly people do expect, old
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         461
 heads on young shoulders. You have studied Annie's character, and
 you understand it. That's what I find so charming ! "
    Even the calm and patient face of Doctor Strong expressed some little
 sense of pain, I thought, under the infliction of these compliments.
    "Therefore, my dear Doctor," said the Soldier, giving him several
 affectionate taps, "you may command me, at all times and seasons. Now,
 do understand that I am entirely at your service. I am ready to go
 with Annie to operas, concerts, exhibitions, all kinds of places ; and you
 shall never find that I am tired. Duty, my dear Doctor, before every
 consideration in the universe ! "
    She was as good as her word. She was one of those people who can
 bear a great deal of pleasure, and she never flinched in her perseverance
 in the cause. She seldom got hold of the newspaper (which she settled
herself down in the softest chair in the house to read through an eye-
glass, every day, for two hours), but she found out something that she
was certain Annie would like to see. I t was in vain for Annie to protest
 that she was weary of such things. Her mother's remonstrance always
was, "Now, my dear Annie, I am sure you know better ; and I must tell
you, my love, that you are not making a proper return for the kindness of
Doctor Strong."
    This was usually said in the Doctor's presence, and appeared to me to
constitute Annie's principal inducement for withdrawing her objections
when she made any. But in general she resigned herself to her mother,
and went where the Old Soldier would.
    I t rarely happened now that Mr. Maldon accompanied them. Some-
times my aunt and Dora were invited to do so, and accepted the invi-
tation. Sometimes Dora only was asked. The time had been, when I
should have been uneasy in her going ; but reflection on what had passed
that former night in the Doctor's study, had made a change in my mistrust.
I believed that the Doctor was right, and I had no worse suspicions.
    My aunt rubbed her nose sometimes when she happened to be alone
with me, and said she couldn't make it out; she wished they were hap-
pier; she didn't think our military friend (so she always called the Old
Soldier) mended the matter at all. Xly aunt further expressed her opinion
"that if our military friend would cut off those butterflies, and give 'em
to the chimney-sweepers for May-day, it would look like the beginning of
something sensible on her part."
   But her abiding reliance was on Mr. Dick. That man had evidently an
idea in his head, she said; and if lie could only once pen it up into a
corner, which was his great difficulty, he would distinguish himself in
some extraordinary manner.
   Unconscious of this prediction, Mr. Dick continued to occupy precisely
the same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. Strong. He seemed
neither to advance nor to recede. He appeared to have settled into his
original foundation, like a building; and I must confess that my faith in
his ever moving, was not much greater than if he had been a building.
   BLI~one night, when I had been married some months, Mr. Dick put
his head into the parlor, where I was writing alone (Dora having gone
out with my aunt to take tea with the two little birds), and said, with a
significant cough :
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  " You couldn't speak to me without inconveniencing yourself, Trotwood,
I am afraid ? "
  " Certainly, Mr. Dick," said I ; "come in ! "
  " Trotwood," said Mr. Dick, laying his finger on the side of his nose,
after he had shaken hands with me. "Before I sit down, I wish to make
an observation. You know your aunt? "
    " A little," I replied.
    " She is the most wonderful woman in the world, sir ! "
   After the delivery of this communication, which he shot out of himself
as if he were loaded with it, Mr. Dick sat down with greater gravity than
usual, and looked at me.
    " Now, boy," said Mr. Dick, " I am going to put a question to you."
    "As many as you please," said I.
    " What do you consider me, sir? " asked Mr. Dick, folding his arms.
    " A dear old friend," said I.
   " Thank you, Trotwood," returned Mr. Dick, laughing, ancl reaching
across in high glee to shake hands with me. "But I mean,boy," resuming his
gravity, "what do you consider me in this respect ?" touching his forehead.
   I was puzzled how to answer, but he helped me with a word.
    " Weak ? " said Mr. Dick.
    "Well," I replied, dubiously. " Rather so."
    "Exactly ! " cried Mr. Dick, who seemed quite enchanted by my reply.
"That is, Trotwood, when they took some of the trouble out of you-know-
who's head, and put it you know where, there was a-"              Mr. Dick
made his two hands revolve very fast about each other a great number of
times, and then brought them into collision, and rolled them over and
over one another, to express confusion. "There was that sort of thing
done to me somehow ? E h ? "
    I nodded at him, and he nodded back again.
    " I n short, boy," said Mr. Dick, dropping his voice to a whisper, " I
am simple."
    I would have qualified that conclusion, but he stopped me.
    "Yes, I am ! She pretends I am not. She won't hear of it ; but I
am. I know I am. If she hadn't stood my friend, sir, I should have
been shnt up, to lead a dismal life these many years. But I'll provide
for her ! I never spend the copying money. I put it in a box. I have
made a will. I ' l l leave it all to her. She shall be rich-noble ! "
    Mr. Dick took out his pocket-handkerchief, aud wiped his eyes. H e
then folded it up with great care, pressed it smooth between his two
hands, put it in his pocket, and seemed to put my aunt away with it.
    "Now you are a scholar, Trotwood," said Mr. Dick. " Yon are a fine
scholar. You know what a learned man, what a great man, the Doctor is.
You know what honor he has always done me. Xot proud in his wisdom.
Ilumble, humble-condescending even to poor Dick, who is simple and
knows nothing. I have sent his name up, on a scrap of paper, to the
kite, along the string, when it has been in the sky, among the larks.
The kite has been glad to receive it, sir, and the sky has been brighter
with it."
    I delighted him by saying, most heartily, that the Doctor was deserving
 of our best respect and highest esteem.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          463
     And his beautiful wife is a star," said Mr. Dick. " A shining star.
 I have seen her shine, sir. Bat," bringing his chair nearer, and laying
  one hand upon my knee-" clouds, sir-clouds."
     I answered the solicitude which his face expressed, by conveying the
 same expression into my own, and shaking my head.
     " What clouds ? " said Mr. Dick.
     He looked so wistfully into my face, and was so anxious to understand,
 that I took great pains to answer him slolvly and distinctly, as I might
 have entered on an explanation to a child.
    " There is some unfortunate division between them," I replied. "Some
 unhappy cause of separation. A secret. I t may be inseparable from the
 discrepancy in their years. I t may have grown up out of almost
 nothing."
    !&.Dick, who told off every sentence with a thoughtful nod, paused
 when I had done, and sat considering, with his eyes upon my face, and
 his hand upon my knee.
    "Doctor not angry with her, Trotwood? " he said, after some time.
    " No. Devoted to her."
    "Then, I have got it, boy ! " said Mr. Dick.
    The sudden exultation with which he slapped me on the knee, and
leaned back in his chair, with his eyebrows lifted up as high as he could
possibly lift them, made me think him farther out of his wits than ever.
 He became as suddenly grave again, and leaning forward as before, said-
first respectfully taking out his pocket-handkerchief, as if it really did
represent my aunt :
    "Most wonderful woman in the world, Trotwood. Why has she done
nothing to set things right ? "
    " Too delicate and difficult a subject for such interference," I replied.
    "Fine scholar," said Mr. Dick, touching me with his finger. " Why
has he done nothing."
   "For the same reason," I returned.
   " Then, I have got it, boy ! " said Mr. Dick.      And he stood up before
me, more exultingly than before, nodding his head, and striking himself
repeatedly upon the breast, ~ m t i lone might have supposed that he had
nearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body.
   " A poor fellow with a craze, sir," said Mr. Dick, " a simpleton, a weak-

minded person-present       company, you know ! " striking himself again,
" may do what wonderful people may not do.          I'll bring them together,
boy. I'll try. They '11 not blame me. They '11 not object to me. They '11
not mind what I do, if it 's wrong. I 'm only Mr. Dick. And who minds
Dick? Dick's nobody ! Whoa! " He blew a slight, contemptuous
breath, as if he blew himself away.
   I t was fortunate he had proceeded so far with his mystery, for we heard
the coach stop at the little garden gate, which brought my aunt and Dora
home.
   " Not a word, boy ! " he pursued in a whisper ; " leave all the blame
with Dick-simple Dick-mad Dick. I have been thinking, sir, for Eome
time that I was getting it, and now I have got it. After what you have
said to me, I am sure I have got it. All right ! "
   Not another word did Mr. Dick utter on the subject; but he made a
464           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

very telegraph of himself for the next half-hour (to the great disturbance
of my aunt's mind), to enjoin inviolable secresy on me.
    To my surprise I heard no more about it for some two or three weeks,
though I was sufficiently interested in the result of his endeavours;
 descrying a strange gleam of good sense-I say nothing of good feeling,
for that he always exhibited-in the conclusion to which he had come. At
last I began to believe, that, in the flighty and unsettled state of his mind,
he had either forgotten his intention or abandoned it.
    One fair evening, when Dora was not inclined to go out, my aunt and I
strolled up to the Doctor's cottage. I t was autumn, when there were no
debates to vex the evening air; and I remember how the leaves snielt
like our garden at Blunderstone as we trod them under foot, and how the
old, unhappy feeling, seemed to go by, on the sighing wind.
   I t was twilight when we reached the cottage. Mrs. Strong was just
coming out of the garden, where Mr. Dick yet lingered, busy with his
knife, helping the gardener to point some stakes. The Doctor was engaged
with some one in his study; but the visitor would be gone directly, Mrs.
Strong said, and begged us to remain and see him. We went into the
drawing-room with her, and sat down by the darkening window. There
was never any ceremony about the visits of such old friends and neighbours
as we were.
   We had not sat here many minutes, when Mrs. Markleham, who usually
contrived to be in a fuss about something, came bustling in, with her
newspaper in her hand, and said, out of breath, " My goodness gracious,
Annie, why didn't you tell me there was some one in the Study! "
    " My dear mama," she quietly returned, " how could I know that you
desired the information ! "
    "Desired the information ! " said Mrs. Markleham, sinking on the sofa.
 " I never had such a turn in all my life ! "
    " Have you been to the Study then, mama ? " asked Annie.

    " Bee32 to the Study, my dear ! " she returned emphatically.     " Indeed
I have ! I came upon the amiable creature-if you'll imagine my feelings,
Miss Trotwood and David-in the act of making his will."
   Her daughter looked round from the window quickly.
   " I n the act, my dear Annie," repeated Mrs. Marlileham, spreading the
newspaper on her lap lilie a table-cloth, and patting her hands upon it,
"of making his last Will and Testament. The foresight and affection
of the dear! I must tell you how it was. I really must, in justice to the
darling-for heis nothing less !-tell you how it was. Perhaps you know,
Miss Trotwood, that there is never a candle lighted in this house, until
one's eyes are literally falling out of one's head with being stretched to
read the paper. And that there is not a chair in this house, in which a
paper can be what I call, read, except one in the Study. This took me
to the Study, where I saw a light. I opened the door. I n company with
the dear Doctor were two professional people, evidently connected with
the law, and they were all three standing at the table : the darling Doctor
penin hand. ' This simply expresses then,' said the Doctor-Annie, my
love, attend to the very words-'this simply expresses then, gentlemen,
the confidence I have in Mrs. Strong, and gives her all unconditionally ? '
One of the professional people replied, And gives her all unconditionally.'

Upon that, with the natural feelings of a mother, I said, ' Good God, I beg
your pardon ! ' fell over the door-step, and came away through the little
back passage where the pantry is."
   Mrs. Strong opened the window, and went out into the verandah, where
she stood leaning against a pillar.
   " But now isn't it, Miss Trotwood, isn't it, David, invigorating," said

Mrs. Markleham, mechanically following her with her eyes, " to find a
man at Doctor Strong's time of life, with the strength of mind to do this
kindofthing? I t only shows how right I was. I said to Annie, when
Doctor Strong paid a very flattering visit to myself, and made her the
subject of a declaration and an offer, I said, 'My dear, there is no doubt
whatever, in my opinion, with reference to a suitable provision for you,
that Doctor Strong will do more than he binds himself to do.' "
   Here the bell rang, and we heard the sound of the visitors' feet as they
went out.
   " It's all over, no doubt," said the Old Soldier, after listening; " the

dear creature has signed, sealed, and delivered, and his mind's at rest.
Well it may be ! What a mind ! Annie, my love, I am going to the Study
with my paper, for I am a poor creature without news. Miss Trotwood,
David, pray come and see the Doctor."
   I was conscious of Mr. Dick's standing in the shadow of the room,
shutting up his knife, when we accompanied her to tlie Study ; and of my
aunt's rubbing her nose violently, by the way, as a mild vent for her
intolerance of our military friend ; but who got first into the Study, or how
Mrs. Markleham settled herself in a moment in her easy chair, or how my
aunt and I came to be left together near the door (unless her eyes were
quicker than mine, and she held me back), I have forgotten, if I ever knew.
But this I know,-that we saw the Doctor before he saw us, sitting at his
table, among the folio volumes in which he delighted, resting his head
calmly on his hand. That, in the same moment, we saw Mrs. Strong glide
in, pale and trembling. That Mr. Dick supported her on his arm. That
he laid his other hand upon the Doctor's arm, causing him to look up with
an abstracted air. That, as the Doctor moved his head, his wife dropped
down on one knee at his feet, and, with her hands imploringly lifted, fixed
upon his face the memorable look I had never forgotten. That at this
sight Mrs. Markleham dropped the newspaper, and stared more like a
figure-head intended for a ship to be called The Astonishment, than any-
thing else I can think of.
   The gentleness of the Doctor's manner and surprise, the dignity that
mingled with tlie supplicating attitude of his wife, the amiable concern
of Mr. Dick, and the earnestness with which my aunt said to herself,
" That man mad ! " (triumphantly expressive of the misery from which she
had saved him), I see and hear, rather than remember, as I write about it.
   "Doctor ! " said Mr. Dick. " What is it that's amiss? Look here ! "
   " Annie ! " cried the Doctor.    "Not at my feet, my dear ! "
   " Yes ! " she said. " I beg and pray that no one will leave the room !
Oh, my husband and father, break this long silence. Let us both know
what it is that has come between us ! "
   Mrs. Markleham, by this time recovering the power of speech, and
seeming to swell with family pride and motherly indignation, here
                                                              H H

exclaimed, "Annie, get up immediately, and don't disgrace everybody be-
longing to you by humbling yourself l ~ k ethat, unless you wish to see me
go out of my mind on the spot! "
    " Mama ! " returned Annie.       " Waste no words on me, for my appeal
is to my husband, and even you are nothing here."
    "Nothing ! " exclaimed Mrs Markleham. " Me, nothing ! The child
has taken leave of her senses. Please to get me a glass of water !"
    I was too attentive to the Doctor and his wife, to give any heed to this
request ; and it made no impression on anybody else ; so Mrs. Markleham
panted, stared, and fanned herself.
    " Annie ! " said the Doctor, tenderly taking her in his hands. " My
dear ! If any unavoidable change has come, in the sequence of time, upon
our married life, you are not to blame. The fault is mine, and only mine.
There is no change in my affection, admiration, and respect. I wish to
make you happy. I truly love and honor you. Rise, Annie,.pray ! "
    But she did not rise. After looking at him for a little while, she sank
clown closer to him, laid her arm across his knee, and dropping her head
upon it, said :
    " If I have any friend here, who can speak one word for me, or for my

husband, in this matter; if I have any friend here, who can give a voice
to any suspicion that my heart has sometimes whispered to me ; if I have
 any friend here, who honors my husband, or has ever cared for me, and
 has anything within his knowledge, no matter what it is, that may help to
 mediate between us, I implore that friend to speak ! "
    There was a profound silence. After a few moments of painful hesi-
 tation, I broke the silence.
     " Mrs. Strong,"   I said, I C there is something within my knowledge,
 which I have been earnestly entreated by Doctor Strong to conceal, and
 have concealed until to-night. But, I believe the time has come when it
 would be mistaken faith and delicacy to conceal it any longer, and when
 your appeal absolves me from his injunction."
     She turned her face towards me for a moment, and I knew that I was
 right. I could not have resisted its entreaty, if the assurance that it gave
 me had been less convincing.
     " Our future peace," she said, "may be in your hands. I trust it
 confidently to your not suppressing anything. I know beforehand that
 nothing you, or any one, can tell me, will show my husband's noble heart
 in any other light than one. Howsoever it may seem to you to touch
 me, disregard that. I will speak for myself, before him, and before God
 afterwards."
     Thus earnestly besought, I made no reference to the Doctor for his
 permission, but, without any other compromise of the truth than a little
  softening of the coarseness of Uriah Heep, related plainly what had passed
  in that same room that night. The staring of Mrs. Markleham during
  the whole narration, and the shrill, sharp interjections with which she
  occasionally interrupted it, defy description.
     When 1 had finished, Annie rema~ncd,for some fcw moments, silent,
  with her head bent down, as I have described. Then, she took the
  Doctor's hand (he was sitting in the same attitude as when we had
  entered the room), and pressed it to her breast, and kissed it. Mr. Dick

 softly raised her; and she stood, when she began to speak, leaning on him,
and looking down upon her husband-from whom she never turned her eyes.
    "All that has ever been in my mind, since I was married," she said
in a low, submissive, tender voice, " I will lay bare before you. I could
not live and have one reservation, knowing what I know now."
    "Nay, Annie," said the Doctor, mildly, " I have never doubted you,
my ch~ld. There is no need ; indeed there is no need, my dear."
    "There is great need," she answered, in the same way, " that I
should open my whole lieart before the soul of generosity and truth,
whom, year by year, and day by day, I have loved and venerated more
and more, as Heaven knows ! "
    " Really,"  interrupted Mrs. Markleham, " if I have any discretion
at all-"
    ("Which you haven't, you Marplot," observed my aunt, in an
indignant whisper.)
  -'I    I must be permitted to observe that it cannot be requisite to enter
into these details."
    "No one but my husband can judge of that, mama," said Annie,
without removing her eyes from his face, "and he will hear me. If I
say anything to give you pain, mama, forgive me. I have borne pain first,
often and long, myself."
    "Upon my word ! " gasped Mrs. Markleham.
    "When I was very young," said Annie, "quite a little child, my
first associations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from a
patient friend and teacher-the friend of my dead father-who                   was
always dear to me. I can remember nothing that I know, without
remembering him. H e stored my mind with its first treasures, and
stamped his character upon them all. They never could have been, I
think, as good as they have been to me, if I had taken them from any
other hands."
    " Makes her mother nothing ! " exclaimed Mrs. Markleham.

    "Not so, mama," s a ~ dAnnie; "but I make him what he was. I
must do that. As I grew up, he occupied the same place still. I was
proud of his interest : deeply, fondly, gratefully attached to him. I looked
up to him I can hardly describe how-as a father, as a guide, as one
whose praise was different from all other praise, as one in whom I could
have trusted and confided, if I had doubted all the world. You know,
mama, how young and inexperienced I was, when you presented him
before me, of a sudden, as a lover."
    " I have mentioned the fact, fifty times at least, to everybody here ! "

said Mrs. Markleham.
    (" Then hold your tongue, for the Lord's sake, and don't mention it any
more ! " muttered my aunt).
    " It was so great a change: so great a loss, I felt it, at first," said Annie,

 still preserving the same look and tone, "that I was agitated and dis-
tressed. I was but a girl; and when so great a change came in the
 character in which I had so long looked up to him, I think I was sorry.
But nothing could have made him what he used to be again; and I was
proud that he should think me so worthy, and we were married."

468          TIIE PERSONAL HISTOEY AND EXPERIENCE

   (" Confound the woman ! " said my aunt, "she zcon't be quiet ! ")
   '(I never thought," proceeded Annie, with a heightened color, "of any
worldly gain that my husband would bring to me. My young heart had
no room in its homage for any such poor reference. Mama, forgive me
when I say that it was you who first presented to my mind the thought
that any one could wrong me, and wrong him, by such a cruel suspicion."
   " Me ! " cried Mrs. Markleham.
   (" Ah ! You, to be sure ! " observed my aunt, "and you can't fan it
away, my military friend ! ")
   " I t was the first unhappiness of my new life," said Annie.       " I t was
the first occasion of every unhappy moment I have known. Those moments
have been more, of late, than I can count; but not-my                 generous
husband !-not for the reason you suppose; for in my heart there is not
a thought, a recollection, or a hope, that any power could separate
from you ! "
   She raised her eyes, and clasped her hands, and looked as beautiful and
true, I thought, as any Spirit. The Doctor looked on her, henceforth, as
stedfastlg as she on him.
   "Mama is blameless," she went on, "of having ever urged you for
herself, and she is blameless in intention everyway, I am sure,-but when
I saw how many importunate claims that were no claims were pressed upon
you in my name; how you were traded on in my name; how generous
you were, and how Mr. MTickfield,who had your welfare very much at
heart, resented i t ; the first sense of my exposure to the mean suspicion that
my tenderness was bought-and sold to you, of all men, on earth-fell
upon me, like unmerited disgrace, in which I forced you to participate.
I cannot tell you what it was-mama cannot imagine what it was-to have
this dread and trouble always on my mind, yet know in my own soul that
on my marriage-day I crowned the love and honor of my life ! "
    " A specimen of the thanks one gets," cried Mrs. Markleham, in tears,

" for taking care of one's family ! I wish I was a Turk ! "
   (" I wish you were, with all my heart-and in your native country ! "
said my aunt).
    " I t was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my Cousin

Maldon. I had liked him : " she spoke softly, but without any hesitation :
 "very much. We had been little lovers once. If circumstances had
not happened otherwise, I might have come to persuade myself that I
really loved him, and might have married him, and been most wretched.
Therecau be no disparity inmarriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose."
    I pondered on those words, even while I was studiously attending to
 what followed, as if they had some particular interest, or some strange
application that I could not divine. "There can be no disparity in mar-
riage like unsuitability of mind and purpose "-" no disparity in marriage
like unsuitability of mind and purpose."
    "There is nothing," said Annie, "that we have in common. I have
 long found that there is nothing. If I were thankful to my husband for
 no more, instead of for so much, I should be thankful to him for having
 saved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart."
    She stood quite still, before the Doctor, and spoke with an earnestness
 that thrilled me. Yet her voice was just as quiet as before,

   "When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence, so freely
 bestowed for my sake, and when I was unhappy in the mercenary
 shape I was made to wear, I thought it would have become him better to
have worked his own way on. I thought that if I had been he, I would
have tried to do it, at the cost of almost any hardship. But I thought no
worse of him, until the night of his departure for India. That night I
knew he had a false and thankless heart. I saw a double meaning, then,
in Mr. Wickfield's scrutiny of me. I perceived, for the first time, the dark
suspicion that shadowed my life."
   " Suspicion, Annie !jJ   said the Doctor. "No, no, no ! jJ


   " I n your mind there was none, I know, my husband ! " she returned.
"And when I came to you, that night, to lay down all my load of shame
and grief, and knew that I had to tell, that, underneath your roof, one
of my own kindred, to whom you had been a benefactor, for the love
of me, had spoken to me words that should have found no utterance,
even if I had been the weak and mercenary wretch he thought me-my
mind revolted from the taint the very tale conveyed. I t died upon my
lips, and from that hour till now has never passed them."
   Mrs. Marltleham, with a short groan, leaned back in her easy chair; and
retired behind her fan, as if she were never coming out any more.
   "I have never, but in your presence, interchanged a word with him
from that time ; then, only when it has been necessary for the avoidance
of this explanation. Years have passed since he knew, from me, what his
situation here was. The kindnesses you have secretly done for his advance-
ment, and then disclosed to me, for my surprise and pleasure, have been, you
will believe, but aggravations of the unhappiness and burden of my secret."
   She sunk down gently at the Doctor's feet, though he did his utmost
to prevent her ; and said, looking up, tearfully, into his face :
   "Do not speak to me yet! Let me say a little more! Right or
wrong, if this were to be done again, I think I should do just the same.
You never can know what it was to be devoted to you, with those old asso-
ciations; to find that any one could be so hard as to suppose that the
truth of my heart was bartered away, and to be surrounded by appearances
confirming that belief. I was very young, and had no adviser. Between
mama and me, in all relating to you, there was a wide division. If I
shrunk into myself, hiding the disrespect I had undergone, it was because
I honored you so much, and so much wished that you should honor me! "
   " Annie, my pure heart ! " said the Doctor, '' my dear girl ! "
   " A little more ! a very few words more ! I used to think there were
so many whom you might have married, who would not have brought
such charge and trouble on you, and who would have made your home
a worthier home. I used to be afraid that I had better have remained
your pupil, and almost your child. I used to fear that I was so unsuited
to your learning and wisdom. If all this made me shrink within myself
(as indeed it did), when I had that to tell, it was still because I honored
you so much, and hoped that you might one day honor me."
   " That day has shone this long time, Annie," said the Doctor, " and
can have but one long night, my dear."
   "Another word ! I afterwards meant-stedfastly meant, and purposed to
myself-tobear the wholeweight of knowing theunworthinessof one towhom
470            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 you had been so good. And now a last word, dearest and best of friends !
 The cause of the late change in you, which I have seen with so much pain and
 sorrow, and have sometimes referred to my old apprehension-at other times
 to lingering suppositions nearer to the truth-has been made clear to-night ;
 and by an accident I have also come to know, to-night, the full measure of
 your noble trust in me, even under that mistake. I do not hope that any
 love and duty I may render in return, will ever make me worthy of your
 priceless confidence; but with all this knowledge fresh upon me, I can
 lift my eyes to this dear face, revered as a father's, loved as a husband's,
 sacred to me in my childhood as a friend's, and solemnly declare that
 in my lightest thought I have never wronged you ; never wavered in the
 love and the fidelity I owe you! "
     She had her arms around the Doctor's neck, and he leant his head
 down over her, mingling his grey hair with her dark brown tresses.
     "Oh, hold me to your heart, my husband ! Never cast me out ! Do not
 think or speak of disparity between us, for there is none, except in all my
 many imperfections. Every succeeding year I have known this better, as I
 have esteemed you more and more. Oh, take me to your heart, my
 husband, for my love was founded on a rock, and it endures ! "
    I n the silence that ensued, my aunt walked gravely up to Mr. Dick,
 without at all hurrying herself, and gave him a hug and a sounding kiss.
 And it was very fortunate, with a view to his cred~t,that she did so ; for
 I am confident that I detected him at that moment in the act of making
 preparations to stand on one leg, as an appropriate expression of delight.
     " You are a very remarkable man, Dick! " said my aunt, with an air

 of unqualified approbation; '(and never pretend to be anything else,
for I know better ! "
    With that, my aunt pulled him by the sleeve, and nodded to me ; and
 we three stole quietly out of the room, and came away.
    " That 's a settler for our military friend, at any rate," said my aunt,
on the way home. " I should sleep the better for that, if there was no-
thing else to be glad of ! "
    "She was quite overcome, I am afraid," said Mr. Dick, with great
commiseration.
    "What ! Did you ever see a crocodile overcome ? " inquired my aunt.
    " I don't think I ever saw a crocodile," returned Mr. Dick, mildly.
    "There never would have been anything the matter, if it hadn't been for
that old Animal," sald my aunt, with strong emphasis. " I t ' s very much
to be wished that some mothers would leave their daughters alone after
marriage, and not be so violently affectionate. They seem to think the
only return that can be made them for bringing an unfortunate young
woman into the world-God bless my soul, as if she asked to be brought,
or wanted to come !-is full liberty to worry her out of it again. What
are you thinking of, Trot P"
    I was thmking of all that had been said. hly mind was still running
on some of the expressions used. "There can be no disparity in marriage
like unsuitability of mind and purpose." " The first mistaken impulse of
an undisciplined heart." '< My love was founded on a rock." But we
were at home ; and the trodden leaves were lying under-foot, and the
autumn wind was blowing.

                          CHAPTER XLVI,
                             INTELLIGENCE.

   I MUST have been married, if I may trust to my imperfect memory for
dates, about a year or so, when one evening, as I was returning from a
solitary walk, thinking of the book I was then writing-for my success had
steadily increased with my steady application, and I was engaged at that
time upon my first work of fiction- I came past Mrs. Steerforth's house.
I had often passed it before, during my residence in that neighbourhood,
though never when I could choose another road. Howbeit, it did sometimes
happen that it was not easy to find another, without making a long circuit;
and so I had passed that way, upon the whole, pretty often.
   I had never done more than glance at the house, as I went by with a
quickened step. I t had been uniformly gloomy and dull. None of the
best rooms abutted on the road; and the narrow, heavily-framed old-
fashioned windows, never cheerful under any circumstances, looked very
dismal, close shut, and with their blinds always drawn down. There mas
a covered way across a little paved court, to an entrance that was never
used; and there was one round staircase window, at odds with all the
rest, and the only one unshaded by a blind, which had the same unoccu-
pied blank look. I do not remember that I ever saw a light in all the house.
If I had been a casual passer-by, I should have probably supposed that
some childless person lay dead in it. If I had happily possessed no know-
ledge of the place, and had seen it often in that changeless state, I should
have pleased my fancy with many ingenious speculations, I dare say.
   As it was, I thought as little of it as I might. But my mind could not go
by it and leave it, as my body did ; and it usually awakened a long train of
meditations. Coming before me, on this particular evening that I mention,
mingled with the childish recollections and later fancies, the ghosts of
half-formed hopes, the broken shadows of disappointments dimly seen and
understood, the blending of experience and imagination, incidental to the
 occupation with which my thonghts had been busy, it was more than com-
monly suggestive. I fell into a brown study as I walked on, and a voice
at my side made me start.
   I t was a woman's voice, too. I was not long in recollecting Mrs.
 Steerforth's little parlor-maid, who had formerly worn blue ribbons in her
cap. She had taken them out now, to adapt herself, I suppose, to the
altered character of the house; and wore but one or two disconsolate bows
of sober brown.
   " If you please, sir, would you have the goodness to walk in, and speak

to Miss Dartle ? "
    " Ilas Miss Dartle sent you for me?" I inquired.
    " Not to-night, sir, but it's just the same.    Miss Dartle saw you pass
 a night or two ago ; and I was to sit at work on the staircase, and when I
 saw you pass again, to ask you to step in and speak to her."
               THE PERSONAL EIISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   I turned back, and inquired of my conductor, as we went along, how
Mrs. Steerforth was. She said her lady was but poorly, and kept her own
room a good deal.
   When we arrived at the house, I was directed to Miss Dartle in the
garden, and left to make my presence known to her myself. She was
sitting on a seat at one end of a kind of terrace, overlooking the great city.
It was a sombre evening, with a lurid light in the sky; and as I saw the
prospect scowling in the distance, with here and there some larger object
starting up into the sullen glare, I fancied it was no inapt companion to
the memory of this fierce woman.
   She saw me as I advanced, and rose for a moment to receive me. I
thought her, then, still more colorless and thin than when I had seen her
last ; the flashing eyes still brighter, and the scar still plainer.
   Our meeting was not cordial. We had parted angrily on the last
occasion ; and there was an air of disdain about her, which she took no
pains to conceal.
   " I am told you wish to speak to me, Miss Dartle;" said I, standing
near her, with my hand upon the back of the seat, and declining her
gesture of invitation to sit down.
   " If you please," said she. " Pray has this girl been found? "
   " No."
   " And yet she has run away ! "
   I saw her thin lips working while she looked at me, as if they were
eager to load her with reproaches.
    " Run away ? " I repeated.
    " Yes ! From him," she said with a laugh. " If she is not found,
perhaps she never will be found. She may be dead ! "
   The vaunting cruelty with which she met my glance, I never saw
 expressed in any other face that ever 1 have seen.
    " To wish her dead," said I, " may be the kindest wish that one of
her own sex could bestow upon her. I am glad that time has softened
you so much, Miss Dartle."
    She condescended to make no reply, but, turning on me with another
scornful laugh, said :
    " The friends of this excellent and much-injured young lady are friends

of yours. You are their champion, and assert their rights. Do you wish
to know what is known of her?
    "Yes," said I.
   She rose with an ill-favored smile, and, taking a few steps towards a
wall of holly that was near at hand, dividing the lawn from a kitchen-
garden, said, in a louder voice, " Come here ! "-as      if she were calling to
some unclean beast.
    " You wlll restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in

this place, of course, Mr. Copperfield ? " said she, looking over her shoulder
at me with the same expression.
    I inclined my head, without knowing what she meant; and she said,
 " Come here ! " again ; and returned, followed by the respectable Mr.
 Littimer, who, with undiminished respectability, made me a bow, and
 took up his position behind her. The air of wicked grace : of triumph, in

  which, strange to say, there was get something feminine and alluring: with
  which she reclined upon the seat between us, and looked at me, was
 worthy of a cruel Princess in a Legend.
    ii Now," said she, imperiously, without glancing at him, and touching

 the old wound as it throbbed : perhaps, in this instance, with pleasure
 rather than pain. " Tell Mr. Copperfield about the flight."
       Mr. James and myself, ma'am-"
    ii Don't address yourself to me ! " she interrupted, with a frown.

    " Mr. James and myself, sir-"

    " Nor to me, if you please," said I.

    Mr. Littimer, without being at all discomposed, signified by a slight
 obeisance, that anything that was most agreeable to us was most agreeable
 to him ; and began again :
    "Mr. James and myself have been abroad with the young woman, ever
 since she left Yarmouth under Mr. James's protection. We have been in
 a variety of places, and seen a deal of foreign country. We have been in
France, Switzerland, Italy, in fact, almost all parts."
    He looked at the back of the seat, as if he were addressing himself
to that; and softly played upon it with his hands, as if he were striking
chords upon a dumb piano.
    " Mr. James took quite uncommonly to the young woman; and was
more settled, for a length of time, than I have known him to be since I
have been in his service. The young woman was very improvable, and
spoke the languages ; and wouldn't have been known for the same country-
person. I noticed that she was much admired wherever we went."
    Miss Dartle put her hand upon her side. I saw him steal a glance at
her, and slightly smile to himself.
    " Very much admired, indeed, the young woman was.         What with her
dress; what with the air and sun; what with being made so much of;
what with this, that, and the other; her merits really attracted general
notice."
    He made a short pause. Her eyes wandered restlessly over the distant
prospect, and she bit her nether lip to stop that busy mouth.
    Taking his hands from the seat, and placing one of them within the
other, as he settled himself on one leg, Mr. Littimer proceeded, with his
eyes cast down, and his respectable head a little advanced, and a little on
one side :
    " The young woman went on in this manner for some time, being
occasionally low in her spirits, until I think she began to weary Mr. James
by giving way to her low spirits and tempers of that kind ; and things
were not so comfortable. Mr. James he began to be restless again. The
more restless he got, the worse she got ; and I must say, for myself, that I
had a very difficult time of it indeed between the two. Still matters were
patched up here, and made good there, over and over again ; and altogether
lasted, I am sure, for a longer time than anybody could have expected."
    Recalling her eyes from the distance, she looked at me again now, with
her former air. Nr. Littimer, clearing his throat behind his hand with a
respectable short-cough, changed legs, and went on :
    " At last, when there had been, upon the whole, a good many words
474           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

and reproaches, Mr. James he set off one morning, from the neighbourhood
of Naples, where we had a villa (the young woman being very partial to
the sea), and, under pretence of coming back in a day or so, left it in
charge with me to break it out, that, for the general happiness of all con-
cerned, he wasH-here an interruption of the short cough-"gone.
But Mr. James, I must say, certainly did behave extremely honorable;
for he proposed that the young woman should marry a very respectable
person, who was fnlly prepared to overlook the past, and who was, at
least, as good as anybody the young woman could have aspired to in a
regular way : her connexions being very common."
   I l e changed legs again, and wetted his lips. I was convinced that the
scoundrel spoke of himself, and I saw my conviction reflected in Miss
Dartle's face.
   "This I also had it in charge to communicate. I was willing to do
anything to relieve Mr. James from his difficulty, and to restore harmony
between himself and an affectionate parent, who has undergone so much
on his account. Therefore I undertook the commission. The young
woman's violence when she came to, after I broke the fact of his departure,
was beyond all expectations. She was quite mad, and had to be held by
force; or, if she couldn't have got to a knife, or got to the sea, she'd have
beaten her head against the marble floor."
   Miss Dartle, leaning back upon the seat, with a light of exultation in
her face, seemed almost to caress the sounds this fellow had uttered.
   "But when I came to the second part of what had been entrusted to
me," said Mr. Littimer, rubbing his hands, uneasily, "which anybody
might have supposed would have been, at all events, appreciated as a
kind intention, then the young woman came out in her true colors. A
more outrageous person I never did see. Her conduct was surprisingly
bad. She had no more gratitude, no more feeling, no more patience, no
more reason in her, than a stock or a stone. If I hadn't been upon my
guard, I am convinced she would have had my blood."
   " I tliink the better of her for it," said I, indignantly-
   Mr. Littimer bent his head, as much as to say, " Indeed, sir ? But
you 're young ! " and resumed his narrative.
   " I t was necessary, in short, for a time, to take away everything nigh
her, that she could do herself, or anybody else, an injury with, and to shut
her up close. Not~vithstandingwhich, she got out in the night ; forced
the lattice of a window, that I had nailed up myself; dropped on a vine
that was trailed below; and never has been seen or heard of, to my
knowledge, since."
   " She is dead, perhaps," said Miss Dartle, with a smile, as if she could
have spurned the body of the ruined girl.
   " She may have drownded herself, miss," returned Mr. Littimer,
catching at an excuse for addressing himself to somebody. " I t ' s
very possible. Or, she may have had assistance from the boatmen, and
the boatmens' wives and children. Being given to low company, she
was very much in the habit of talking to them on the beach, Miss
Dartle, and sitting by their boats. I have known her do it, when
 Mr. James has been away, whole days. Mr. James was far from pleased
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          475
  to find out, once, that she had told the children she was a boatman's
  daughter, and that in her own country, long ago, she had roamed about
  the beach, like them."
     Oh, Emily ! Unhappy beauty ! What a picture rose before me of her
  sitting on the far-off shore, among the children like herself when she was
  innocent, listening to little voices such as might have called her Mother
  had she been a poor man's wife ; and to the great voice of the sea, with
  its eternal " Never more ! "
     " When it was clear that nothing could be done, Miss Dartle-"

     "Did I tell you not to speak to me?" she said, with stern contempt.
     "You spoke to me, miss," he replied. " I beg your pardon. But
 it's my service to obey."
     "Do your service," she returned. "Finish your story, and go ! "
     "When it was clear," he said, with infinite respectability, and an
 obedient bow, "that she was not to be found, I went to Mr. James, at
 the place where it had been agreed that I should write to him, and
 informed him of what had occurred. Words passed between ns in
 consequence, and I felt it due to my character to leave him. I could
 bear, and I have borne, a great deal from Mr. James; but he insulted
 me too far. He hurt me. Knowing the unfortunate difference between
 himself and his mother, and what her anxiety of mind was likely to be, I
 took the liberty of coming home to England, and relating-"
     "For money which I paid him," said Miss Dartle to me.
     "Just so, ma'am-and       relating what I knew. I am not aware," said
 Mr. Littimer, after a moment's reflection, "that there is anything else.
 I am at present out of employment, and should be happy to meet with a
 respectable situation.''
     Miss Dartle glanced at me, as though she would inquire if there were
 anything that I desired to ask. As there was something which had
 occurred to my mind, I said in reply :
     " I could wish to know from this-creature,"     I could not bring myself
to utter any more conciliatory word, "whether they intercepted a letter
that was written to her from home, or whether he supposes that she
received it."
    EIe remained calm and silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and
the tip of every finger of his right hand delicately poised against the tip
of every finger of his left.
    Miss Dartle turned her head disdainfully towards him.
     " I beg your pardon, miss," he said, awakening from his abstraction,

"but, however submissive to you, I have my position, though a servant.
Mr. Copperfield and you, miss, are different people. If Mr. Copperfield
wishes to know anything from me, I take the liberty of reminding
Mr. Copperfield that he can put a question to me. I have a character to
maintain."
    After a momentary struggle with myself, I turned my eyes upon him,
and said, " You have heard my q~~estion.Consider it addressed to yourself,
if you choose. What answer do you make ? "
     " Sir," he rejoined, with an occasional separation and reunion of those

delicate tips, " my answer must be qualified ;because, to betray Mr. James's
476            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

confidence to his mother, and to betray it to you, are two different actions.
I t is not probable, I consider, that Mr. James would encourage the receipt
of letters likely to increase low spirits and unpleasantness; but further
than that, sir, I should wish to avoid going."
    " I s that all? " enquired Miss Dartle of me.
    I indicated that I had nothing more to say. "Except," I added, as I
saw him moving off, "that I understand this fellow's part in the wicked
story, and that, as I shall make it known to the honest man who has been
her father from her childhood, I would recommend him to avoid going too
much into public."
    He had stopped the moment I began, and had listened with his usual
repose of manner.
    "Thank you, sir. But you'll excuse me if I say, sir, that there are
neither slaves nor slave-drivers in this country, and that people are not
allowed to take the law into their own hands. If they do, it is more to
their own peril, I believe, than to other people's. Consequently speaking,
I am not at all afraid of going wherever I may wish, sir."
    With that, he made me a polite bow ; and, with another to Miss Dartle,
went away through the arch in the wall of holly by which he had come.
Miss Dartle and I regarded each other for a little while in silence; her
manner being exactly what it was, when she had produced the man.
    " H e says besides," she observed, with a slow curling of her lip, "that
his master, as he hears, is coasting Spain ; and this done, is away to gratify
his seafaring tastes till he is weary. But that is of no interest to you.
Between these two proud persons, mother and son, there is a wider breach
than before, and little hope of its healing, for they are one at heart, and time
makes each more obstinate and imperious. Neither is this of any interest
to you ; but it introduces what I wish to say. This devil whom you make an
angel of, I mean this low girl whom he picked out of the tide-mud," with
her black eyes full upon me, and her passionate finger up, "may be alive,-
for I believe some common things are hard to die. If she is, you will desire
to have a pearl of such price found and taken care of. We desire that,
too; that he may not by any chance be made her prey again. So far, we
are united in one interest; and that is why I, who would do her any mis-
chief that so coarse a wretch is capable of feeling, have sent for you to
hear what you have heard."
    I saw, by the change in her face, that some one was advancing behind
me. I t was Mrs. Steerforth, who gave me her hand more coldly than
of yore, and with an augmentation of her former stateliness of manner;
but still, I perceived-and       I was touched by it-with an ineffaceable
remembrance of my old love for her son. She was greatly altered. Her
fine figure was far less upright, her handsome face was deeply marked,
and her hair was almost white. But when she sat down on the seat, she
was a handsome lady still; and well I knew the bright eye with its lofty
look, that had been a light in my very dreams at school.
    " I s Mr. Coppei-field informed of everything, Rosa ? "
    I r Yes."

    "And has he heard Littimer himself? "
    "Yes ; I have told him why you wished it."
                       OF DAVID C O P P E P ~ P I E ~ .                 477
    'LYou are a good girl. I have had some slight correspondence with
your former friend, sir," addressing me, "but it has not restored his sense
of duty or natural obligation. Therefore I have no other object in this,
than what Rosa has mentioned. If, by the course which may relieve the
mind of the decent man you brought here (for whom I am sorry-1 can
say no more), my son may be saved from again falling into the snares of a
designing enemy, well ! "
    She drew herself up, and sat looking straight before her, far away.
        Madam," I said respectfully, cc I understand. I assure you I am in no
danger of putting any strained construction on your motives. But I must
say, even to you, having known this injured family from childhood, that if
you suppose the girl, so deeply wronged, has not been cruelly deluded, and
would not rather die a hundred deaths than take a cup of water from
your son's hand now, you cherish a terrible mistake."
     I' Well, Rosa, well ! " said .Mrs. Steerforth, as the other was about to

interpose, " i t is no matter. Let it be. You are married, sir, I am
told ? "
   I answered that I had been some time married.
   "And are doing well? I hear little in the quiet life I lead, but I
understand you are beginning to be famous."
   " I have been very fortunate," I said, " and find my name connected
with some praise."
    "You have no mother? "-in a softened voice.
   c c No
        9'


    " I t is a pity," she returned. " She would have been proud of you.
Good night ! "
    I took the hand she held out with a dignified, unbending air, and it was
as calm in mine as if her breast had been at peace. Her pride could still
its very pulses it appeared, and draw the placid veil before her face,
through which she sat looking straight before her on the far distance.
     As I moved away from them along the terrace, I could not help
observing how steadily they both sat gazing on the prospect, and how it
thickened and closed around them. Here and there, somc early lamps
were seen to twinkle in the distant city; and in the eastern quarter of the
sky the lurid light still hovered. But, from the greater part of the broad
valley interposed, a mist was rising like a sea, which, mingling with the
darkness, made it seem as if the gathering waters would encompass them.
I have reason to remember this, and think of it with awe; for before I
looked upon those two again, a stormy sea had risen to their feet,
      Reflecting on what had been thus told me, I felt it right that it should
 be communicated to Mr. Peggotty. On the following evening I went into
 London in quest of him. He was always wandering about from place to
 place, with his one object of recovering his niece before him; but was
 more in London than elsewhere. Often and often, now, had I seen him in
 the dead of night passing along the streets, searching, among the few who
 loitered out of doors at those untimely hours, for what he dreaded to find.
      He kept a lodging over the little chandler's shop in Hungerford Narliet,
 which I have had occasion to mention more than once, and from which he
 first went forth upon his errand of mercy. Hither I directed my walk.
47 8            TI-IE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 On making inquiry for him, I learned from the people of the house that
 he had not gone out yet, and I should find him in his room up-sta~re.
    He was s ~ t t ~ nreading
                        g     by a window in which he kept a few plants. The
 room was very neat and orderly. I saw in a moment that it was always
 kept prepared for her reception, and that he never went out but he thought
 it possible he might bring her home. He had not lieard my tap
 at the door, and only raised his eyes when I laid my hand upon his
 shoulder.
    " Mas'r Davy ! Thankee, sir ! thankee hearty, for this visit !     Sit ye
 down. You 're kindly welcome, sir ! "
    "Mr. Prggotty," said I, tak~ngthe chair he handed me, " don't expect
 much ! I have heard some news."
    " Of Ern'ly ! "

    H e put his hand, in a nervous manner, on his mouth, and turned pale,
as he fixed his eyes on mine.
    " I t gives no clue to where she is ; but she is not with him."

    He sat down, looking intently at me, and listened in profound silence
to all I had to tell. I well remember the sense of dignity, beauty even,
with which the patient gravity of his face impressed me, when, having
gradually removed his eyes from mine, he sat looking downward, leaning
his forehead on his hand. H e offered no interruption, but remained
throughout perfectly still. H e seemed to pursue her figure through
the narrative, and to let every other shape go by him, as if it were
nothing.
    When I had done, he shaded his face, and continued silent. I looked
 out of the window for a little while, and occupied myself with the plants.
    "How do you fare to feel about it, &IasYrDavy?" he inquired at
length.
    " I think that she is living," I replied.

    " I doen't know. Maybe the first shock was too rough, and in the
wildness of her art -! That there blue water as she used to speak
on. Could she have thowt 0' that so many year, because it was to be
her grave ! "
   He said this, musing, in a low, frightened voice; and walked across
the little room.
    "And yet," he added, " Xas'r Davy, I have felt so sure as she was
living-I have know'd, awake and sleeping, as it was so trew that I should
find her-I have been so led on by it, and held up by it-that I doen't
believe I can have been deceived. No ! Em'ly 's alive ! "
   He put his hand down firmly on the table, and set his sunburnt face
into a resolute expression.
   "My niece, Em'ly, is alive, sir ! " he said, stedfastly. " I doen't know
wheer it comes from, or how 'tis, but I am told as she's alive ! "
   He looked almost l ~ k ea man inspired, as he said it. I waited for a few
moments, until he could give me his und~videdattention; and then pro-
ceeded to explain the precaution, that, it had occurred to me last night,
it would be wise to take.
   " Now, my dear friend-" I began.
   " Thankee, thankee, kind sir," he said, grasping my hand in both of his.
                        OX DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         419
   "If she should make her way to London, which is likely-for where
could she lose herself so readily as in this vast city; and what would she
wish to do, but lose and hide herself, if she does not go home?-"
   " And she won't go home," he interposed, shaking his head mournfully.

" If she had left of her own accord, she might ; not as 'twas, sir."

   " If she should come here," said I, " I believe there is one person, here,
more likely to discover her than any other in the world. Do you remember
-hear what I say, with fortitude-think of your great object !-do you
remember Martha ? "
    " Of our town ? "

   I needed no other answer than his face.
   "Do you know that she is in London?"
    " I have seen her in the streets," he answered, with a shiver.
    " But you don't know," said I, "that      Emily was charitable to her,
with Ham's help, long before she fled from home. Nor, that, when we
met one night, and spoke together in the room yondel; over the way, she
listened at the door."
    " Mas'r Davy ? " he replied in astonishment. " That night when it
snew so hard ? "
    " That night.   I have never seen her since. Iwent back, after parting
from you, to speak to her, but she was gone. I was unwilling to mention
her to you then, and I am now; but she is the person of whom I speak,
and with whom I think we should communicate. Do you under-
stand? "
    " Too well, sir," he replied.     We had sunk our voices, almost to a
whisper, and continued to speak in that tone.
    " You say you have seen her. Do you think that you could find her ?
I could only hope to do so by chance."
    " I think. Mas'r Davv. I Itnow wheer to look."

    " I t is daik. Being tGgether, shall we go out now, and try to find her
       " ?"
 to ninht
    He assented, and prepared to accompany me. Without appearing to
 observe what he was doing, I saw how carefully he adjusted the little
 room, put a candle ready and the means of lighting it, arranged the bed,
 and finally took out of a drawer one of her dresses (I remembered to have
 seen her wear it), neatly folded with some other garments, and a bonnet,
 which he placed upon a chair. He made no allusion to these clothes, neither
 did I. There they had been waiting for her, many and many a night, no
 doubt.
    " The time was, Mas'r Davy," he said, as we came down stairs, " when
 I thowt this girl, Martha, a'most like the dirt underneath my Em'ly's feet.
 God forgive me,' there 's a difference now ! "
    As we went along, partly to hold him in conversation, and partly to
 satisfy myself, I asked him about Ham. I-Ie said, almost in the same
 words as formerly, that Ham was just the same, "wearing away his life
 with kiender no care nohow for't; but never murmuring, and l~ked
 by all."
    I asked him what he thought Ham's state of mind was, in reference to
 the cause of their misfortunes? Whether he believed it was dangerous?
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

What he supposed, for example, Ham would do, if he and Steerforth ever
should encounter ?
   "I doen't know, sir," he replied. "I have thowt of it oftentimes, but
I can't arrize myself of it, no matters."
   I recalled to his remembrance the morning after her departure, when
we were all three on the beach. "Do you recollect," said I, " a certain
wild way in which he looked out to sea, and spoke about 'the end of it.' "
   " Sure I do ! " said he.
   "What do you suppose he meant ? "
   " Mas'r Davy," he replied, " I 've put the question to myself a mort

o' times, and never found no answer. And theer 's one curous thing-
that, though he is so pleasant, I wouldn't fare to feel comfortable to try
and get his mind upon 't. I-Ie never said a wured to me as warn't as
dootiful as dootiful could be, and it ain't likely as he'd begin to speak
any other ways now; but it's fur from being fleet water in his mind,
where them thowts lays. I t ' s deep, sir, and I can't see down."
    " You are right," said I, "and that has sometimes made me anxious."
    " And me too, Mas'r Davy," he rejoined. " Even more so, I do assure
you, than his ventersome ways, though both belongs to the alteration in
him. I doen't know as he 'd do violence under any circumstarnces, but I
hope as them two may be kep asunders."
    we had come, through Temple Bar, into the city. Conversing no more
now, and walking at my side, he yielded himself up to the one aim
of his devoted life, and went on, with that hushed concentration of his
faculties which would have made his figure solitary in a multitude. We
were not far from Blaclcfriars Bridge, when he turned his head and pointed
to a solitary female figure flitting along the opposite side of the street.
I knew it, readily, to be the figure that we sought.
    We crossed the road, and were pressing on towards her, when it occurred
to me that she might be more disposed to feel a woman's interest in the
lost girl, if we spoke to her in a quieter place, aloof from the crowd, and
where we should be less observed. I advised my companion, therefore,
that we should not address her yet, but follow her ; consulting in this,
likewise, an indistinct desire I had, to know where she went.
    He acquiescing, we followed at a distance : never losing sight of her,
but never caring to come very near, as she frequently loolced about.
Once, she stopped to listen to a band of music; and then we stopped too.
    She went on a long way. Still we went on. It was evident, from the
manner in which she held her course, that she was going to some fixed
destination ; and this, and her keeping in the busy streets, and, I suppose
the strange fascination in the secresy and mystery of so following any one,
made me adhere to my first purpose. At length she turned into a dull,
dark street, where the noise and crowd were lost; and I said, "We may
spealr to her now ;"and, mending our pace, we went after her.

                                                           ~ be presented from time
to time.-The co-operation of some of our female writers most distinguished in
imaginative literature has been secured, i n addition to many of those who have
already contributed.-In        A r t , besides furnishing gniclance and information,
especially referrin to the female artist, it is intended more largely than heretofore
to consider the intellectual pleasure of the amateur.-It would be easy to follow
these promises by a list of names: but i t is thought better that the numbers of this
periodical to come shall speak for themselves; the public having learned that
those who are the most earnest in their purposes and the surest in their resources,
will the most carefully avoid every device that savours of puffery.
   While, however, Philosoph              Literature, Science, Imagination, Art, and
Manners, will be in turn treate3; i' t is hoped, with increased spirit,-a "LADIES'
COMPANION,"to merit such companionship, must also hold up "the Glass of
Fashion," and keep open a Board of all manner of dainty and ingenious works.
Here, too, new arrangements of the first importance have been made, and here a
 name carries its own authority and recommendation. The proprietors, there-
fore, announce with pleasure, that the valuable assistance of Madame UBvy,
73, Grosvenor-street, will, in future, be given exclusively to "THE LADIES'
 COMPAAIOX     ;" and that all the information concerning Dress or Fashions which
will henceforth appear in its columns, has either been directly communicated by
that lady, or appears under her sanction. They may also state that the Illustra-
tions of the periodical will appear, for the future, under the superintendence of
H. Noel Humphreys, Esq.
       parts I. to V1. are now ready: and the First Volume will be published
        shortly, being delayed by the preparation of a very elegant cover.

     ,*' The stamped edition of this Journal will be formrded regularly at the charge of
fourpence per week, upon the receipt of a Post-Ofice Order to the o$ice, or of postage stamps for
 such period as theparly may wish to subscribe for.

   This Weekly Magazine has been declared, by a very large portion of the Public Press, to be "one
of the most remarkable publications of the class;"-" of excellent quality and amazing bulk;"-"     for
cheapness and real excellence unequalled;"-"         a useful and formidable auxiliary in the cause of
progress." And i t has been hailed by the numerous class for whom i t is especially intended, as well
as by those who occupy a higher s o c ~ a lposition, as eminently calculated to promote the elevation
and improvement of a most important portion of the community.
  A new and highly-interesting feature will also be introduced into this Magazine, as will be seen
by the following announcement :-

    T h e OBJECTof the Proprietor of Trrs WORKINGMAN'S FRIEND, in publishing these Sketches, i s
 to furnish a succession of vivid pictures, which may serve,-
    Fcrst,-To exhibit the advantages resulting from Sobriety, Industry, Integrity, and Moral Excellence
under the most trying circumstances, namely, of the hardest work and the worst pay.
    Secondly,-To excite the sympathy of those who are in more favourable circnmstances, by bringing
more fully before their view the privations and sufferings which large portions of their brethren and
sisters have to endure; and the great difficultieswith which they have to contend, even in obtaining
the commonest necessaries of life, and in procuring the education and trainlng of their children ; and
the temptations and dangers t o which they are, consequently, exposed.
    Thirdly,-To remove the prejudices, t o allay the apprehensiens, and to engage the kindly officesof
those who have formed unfavourable opinions of the masses, as persons who have imbibed what are
considered extravagant opinions and unwarrantable desires, as to Politics, Religion, and Social
Philosophy and
    ~ i F i n a l l ~ ekeite
                      , ~ ~ oin the minds of all an earnest desire for the amelioration of the condition of
t h e toiling classes, and a determination to employ the most rational means of securing their physical,
intellectual, social, and moral elevation.
    The aim of eaoh writer must be to carry out these objects in a calm and dignified tone, apart from
personal invectives, or abuse of individuals whom bad systems may have betrayed into oppressive
acts. It willnot avail to irritate wounds that are already too grievous to be borne; the wisest course
will be to point out the means by which healing and soundness may be best effected.
   The E d ~ t o r sof THE WORKINGMAN'S FRIENDwill be assisted, in the selection of the best Sketch
or Tale by persons well acquainted with the peculiarities of eaoh system.
   T h e 'ompetitors for No. I. must send in their papers not later than August 14.

     NEW AND POPULAR IIISTORY OF ENGLAND.

WORKING M$N'S LIBRARY. These, with a Volulne entitled, ;THE HISTOIi,Y*PF ENGLAND'S

Kings, but also to present a more f?ithful and interesting history of the People, with tbeir progress in
industrial arts and social amelioration. The acknowledged talents and celebrity of the respective
authors of these works will be a sufficient guarantee for the abllitv and excellence with which they will
be prepared.

     JOHN CASSELL'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG.
  There are Primers, Spelling Books, Grammars, and other helps to Elementary Education, i n
abundance. There are also Libraries of Fairy Tales, Romances, and other works of Fictlon, for the
amusement of youthful readers, almost without end. But there are still ~ v a n t m gcheap, well-written
books, adapted to the capacities of children, and furnishing information as to Natulal Objects, Arts,
Sciences, and hlanufactures. To supply this want. John Cissell proposes t o issue
A NEW SERIES OF INSTRUCTIVE                                   WORKS FOR                CHILDREN;
T o consist of Twelve Books at Sixpence each, in the form of catechisms or dialogues, divided into
sections, and written in a style a t once plain and familiar, interesting and instructive. The aim in
this Serips wiil be, by judicious condensation, to furnish for the youthful mind such a store of infor-
mation as shall prove of avail in after-life, a t t h e same time that i t excites a spirit of laudable
inquiry, and an eager thirst for the higher branches of intellectual, scientific, and moral truth.
   I t is believed that there are few parents, however humble their lot in life, but will feel pleasure in
presenting to their children a copy of each of these books as they make their appearance in suc-
cession. For use in schools, whether public or private, they cannot fail to bs acceptable. They will.
also, be admirably adapted for presents, either as tokens of esteem or rewards for good behaviour.
   The first of the Series will be readv bv the 1st of Auaust next. and will contain
                              ARTS AND M~UFA(ITURES.. NO. I.
         T H E HISTORY OF PAPER-MAKING, WRITING, PRINTING, AND BOOKS.

T   H E EMIGRANT'S ALMANACK for 1850.                              The circulation of
       this Almanack for the year 1849 was upwards of 16,000, and had a larger
number been printed off a much more extensive sale would have resulted, as the demand
made for extended supplies by various booksellers could not be answered. The sale for
1850 will be fully 20,000, and as "the press" has admitted that the EMIGRANT'S
ALMANACK contains a greater mass of useful information on the important subject of
Emigration than any other publication, and as every possible care has been taken to
ensure its entire accuracy, its popularity will exceed that of its predecessor. I t con-
tains advice relative so the United States of America ; describes the routes to the various
fields of emigration; determines the distances to each place; the modes of conveyance;
the length of time occupied in thevarious journeys; expense of transit ; cost of land in
different parts of the world; expense of clearing the soil, and all the official information
from the Commission of Emigration. I n every page i t abounds with practical hints for
the Emigrant of every degree, and altogether forms one of the most interesting and
valuable books of reference ever published on the subject of Emigration.

                                THE DOG-DAYS.
     THEREis a particular Star which philosophers call a Canicular Star, or Dog-Star, which Star, i n its rising
 and setting, determines what we call the Dog-days, now about commencing.
     I t can hardly be considered as descending to dog-grel when E. MOSESand SONsay,
                                               "Let the Dog-days
                                                Be ligbt-' tog ' days."
     The oppressive heat which almost invariably distinguishes this season of the year renders a light coo1
 description of dress absolutely necessary; and E. MOSESand SONhave no wish t o be dog-matical when they
say that positively their Summer Over-coats and other Dress, are the choicest articles that can be purchased.
 If the present Stock of Summer Over-coats, in Alpaca and other materials, are compared, in quality and price.
 with those which used to be worn some years ago, it will be seen what good E. Mosas and SONhave effected.
     Since E. lMosas & SONem-barked in trade, Monopoly has had t o bark in vain for support.
     His dog.ged obstinacy in high prices has availed him nothing ; his full gallop in trade has become a mere
dog-trot, and, the dog has had his day.
     He no longer cuts a "Dash" in business; his styles be-"Tray" him ; and he is obliged t o sneak away like
a dog with his tail burnt. E. MOSES&Son have proved Monopoly to be like the dogin themanger, begrudging
all parties a portion of advantage in his transactions. Like the dog, however, in other fable, he grasped a t a
shadow and lost the substance; which substance E. MOSESand SONflatterthemselves they have long enjoyed
i n the shape of an unprecedented amount of public countenance and support.

 OF the Queens of Scotland, generally, how little is known; and yet how important
were the parts they played in their day ! How prominently were they engaged in
many of the stormy scenes of civil broil, religious and political intrigue, which dis-
tracted Scotland during the reigns of the unfortunate Stuarts ! From the early-and
in many instances violent-deaths of the Scottish Kings causing almost every reign
to commence wit11 a long minority, during which the struggle for pourer lay between
the Queen Mother and the powerful Nobles of the realm, much of a deeply inte-
resting nature is connected with the narratives of their lives ;-the affection or
ambition of a Mother, a stranger in the land, striving for the guardianship of her
So11 and tho political power which it involved, against a turbulent Nobility, always
in search of their own aggrandisement, and contemptuous alike of foreign and
female domination. Events of such importance, and passions of such lasting inte-
rest to human natnre, are involved in the lives of thc Scottish Queens, that their
details can scarcely prove less interesting than those contained in the companion
Lives of this new school of Historical Biography originated by the Author of the
Lives of t71e Queem of England.
  This Series will be comprised in Six Volumes post 8v0, uniform in size with the
Lives of the Queens of Englaad, embellished with Portraits and Engraved Title-
pages.
  VOL. I. will be published early in OCTOBER,   containing the Lives of MARGARET
TUDOR,Queen of James IV.; MAGDALENE           OF FRANCE,  first Queen of James V. ;
MARYOF LORRAINE,      second Queen of James V., and Mother of Queen Mary.
                    Price 10s. 6d., handsomely hoofid in, cloth.
               Volume XI. will be published early in 1851.

                                        tion of this covering of the head impairs good looxs to such a degree that
                                        artificial locks are obliged to be resorted to to give the proper effect to

                             CHAPTER LI.
                THE B E G I N N I N G O F h LONGER JOURNEY.

    ITwas yet early in the morning of the following day, when, as I was
 walking in my garden with my aunt (who took little other exercise
now, being so much in attendance on my dear Dora), I was told that
Mr. Peggotty desired to speak with me. H e came into the garden to
meet me half-way, on my going towards the gate; and bared his head, as
it was always his custom to do when he saw my aunt, for whom he had a
high respect. I had been telling her all that had happened over-night.
Without saying a word, she walked up with a cordial face, shook hands
with him, and patted him on the arm. I t was so expressively done, that
she had no need to say a word. Mr. Peggotty understood her quite as
well as if she had said a thousand.
    " I'll go in now, Trot," said my aunt, " and look after little Blossom,
who will be getting up presently."
    " Not along of my being heer, ma'am, I hope ? " said Mr. Peggotty.
" Unless my wits is gone a bahd's neezing "-by which Mr. Peggotty
meant to say,. bird's-nesting-"
                     ~ . .         this morning, 'tis along of me as yon 're
a going to quit n s ? "
   " You have something to say, my good friend," returned my aunt,

"and will do better without me."
   <' By your leave, ma'am," returned Mr. Peggotty, " I should take it
kind, pervising you doen't mind my clicketten, if you'd bide heer."
   " Would you? " said my aunt, with short good-nature.        " Then I am

sure I will ! "
   So, she drew her arm through Mr. Peggotty's, and walked with him to
a leafy little summer-house there was at the bottom of the garden, where
she sat down on a bench, and I beside her. There was a seat for
Mr. Peggotty too, but he preferred to stand, leaning his hand on the
small rustic table. As he stood, looking at his cap for a little while before
beginning to speak, I conld not help observing what power and force
of character his sinewy hand expressed, and what a good and trusty
companion it was to his honest brow and iron-grey hair.
   " I took my dear child away last night," Mr. Peggotty began, as he
raised his eyes to ours, "to my lodging, wheer I have a long time been
expecting of her and preparing fur her. I t was hours afore she knowed
me right ; and when she did, she kneeled down at my feet, and kiender
said to me, as if it was her prayers, how it all come to be. You may
believe me, when I heerd her voice, as I had heerd at liome so playful-
and see her hanibled, as it might be in the dust our Saviour wrote in
with his blessed hand-I felt a wownd go to my 'art, in the midst of all
its thankfulness."
   He drew his sleeve across his face, without any pretence of concealing
why; and then cleared his voice.
   " I t warn't for long as I felt that; for she was found.    I had on'y to
                                                              L L
514            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

think as she was found, and it was gone. I doeu't know why I do so
much as mention of it now, I ' m sure. I didn't have it in my mind a
minute ago, to say a word about myself; but it come up so nat'ral, that I
yielded to it afore I was avveer."
   "You are a self-denying soul," said my aunt, "and will have your
reward."
   Mr. Peggotty, with the shadows of the leaves playing athwart his
face, made a surprised inclination of the head towards my aunt, as an
acknowledgment of her good opinion; then, took up the thread he had
relinquished.
   " When my Em'ly took flight," he said, in stern wrath for the moment,
"from the house mheer she was made a pris'ner by that theer spotted
snake as Mas'r Davy see,-and his story 'S trelv, and may GODconfound
him!-she      took flight in the night. I t was a dark night, with a many
stars a shining. She was wild. She ran along the sea beach, believing
the old boat was theer; and calling out to us to turn away our faces, for
she was a coming by. She heerd herself a crying out, like as if it was
another person; and cut herself on them sharp-pinted stones and rocks,
and felt it no more than if she had been rock herself. Ever so fur she
run, and there was fire afore her eyes, and roarings in her ears. Of a
sudden-or so she thowt, you unnerstand-the day broke, wet and windy,
and she was lying b'low a heap of stone upon the shore, and a woman
was a speaking to her, saying, in the language of that country, what was
it as had gone so much amiss ? "
   H e saw everything he related. I t passed before him, as he spoke, so
vividly, that, in the intensity of his earnestness, he presented what he
described, to me, with greater distinctness than I can express. I can
hardly believe, writing now long afterwards, but that I was actually
present in these scenes; they are impressed upon me with such an
astonishing air of fidelity.
    "As Em'ly's eyes-which was heavy-see this woman better," Mr.
Peggotty went on, " she know'd as she was one of them as she had often
tallred to on the beach. Fur, though she had run (as I have said) ever so
fur in the night, she had oftentimes wandered long ways, partly afoot,
partly in boats and carriages, and know'd all that country, 'long the
coast, miles and miles. She hadn't no children of her own, this
woman, being a young wife; but she was a looking to have one afore
long. And may my prayers go up to Heaven that 'twill be a happ'ness to
her, and a comfort, and a honor, all her life ! May it love her and be
dootiful to her, in her old age ; helpful of her at the last ; a Angel to her
heer, and heerafter ! "
    "Amen ! " said my aunt.
    " She had been summat timorous and down," said Mr. Peggotty, "and

had sat, at first, a little way off, at her spinning, or such work as it was,
 whenEm'ly talked to the children. But Em'ly had took notice of her, and
 had gone and spoke to her; andas the youngwomanwas partialto thechildren
 herself, they had soon made friends. Sermuchser, that when Em'ly went
 that way, she always giv Em'ly flowers. This was her as now asked
 what it was that had gone so much amiss. Em'ly told her, and she-took
 her home. She did indeed. She took her home," said Mr. Peggotty,
 covering his face.

    He was more affected by this act of kindness, than I had ever seen
 him affected by anything since the night she went away. My aunt and I
 did not attempt to disturb him.
    " I t was a little cottage, you may suppose," he said, presently, " but
 she found space for Em'ly in it,-her husband was away at sea,-and she
 kep it secret, and prevailed upon such neighbours as she had (they was not
 many near) to keep it secret too. Em'ly was took bad with fever, and,
 what is very strange to me is,-maybe 'tis not so strange to scholars,
 -the language of that country went out of her head, and she could only
 speak her own, that no one unnerstood. She recollects, as if she had
 dreamed it, that she lay there, always a talking her own tongue, always
 believing as the old boat was round the next pint in the bay, and begging
 and imploring of 'em to send theer and tell how she was dying, and bring
back a message of forgiveness, if it was on'y a mured. A'most the
whole time, she thowt,-now, that him as I made mention on just now was
lurking for her uunerneath the winder: now that him as had brought
her to this was in the room,-and cried to the good young woman not to
give her up, and know'd, at the same time, that she couldn't unnerstand,
and dreaded that she must be took away. Likewise the fire was afore
her eyes, and the roarings in her ears; and there was no to-day, nor
yesterday, nor yet to-morrow; but everything in her life as ever had been,
or as ever could be, and everything as never had been, and as never could be,
was a crowding on her all at once, and nothing clear nor welcome, and
yet she sang and laughed about it ! How long this lasted, I doen't know;
but then there come a sleep ; and in that sleep, from being a many times
stronger than her own self, she fell into the weakness of thelittlest child."
    Here he stopped, as if for relief from the terrors of his own description.
After being silent for a few moments, he pursued his story.
    " I t was a pleasant arternoon when she awoke; and so quiet, that
there warn't a sound but the rippling of that blue sea without a tide, upon
the shore. I t was her belief, at first, that she was at home upon a Sun-
day morning; but, the vine leaves as she see at the winder, and the hills
beyond, warn't home, and contradicted of her. Then, come in her friend
to watch alongside of her bed; and then she know'd as the old boat
warn't round that next pint in the hay no more, but was fur off; and know'd
where she was, and why; and broke out a crying on that good young
woman's bosom, wheer I hope her baby is a lying now, a cheering of her
with its pretty eyes ! "
    H e could not speak of this good friend of Emily's without a flow of
tears. I t was in vain to try. He broke down again, endeavouring to
bless her !
    "That done my Em'ly good," he resumed, after such emotion as I
could not behold without sharing in; and as to my aunt, she wept with
all her heart ; " that done Em'ly good, and she begun to mend. But, the
language of that country was quite gone from her, and she was forced to
make signs. So she went on, getting better from day to day, slow, but
sure, and trying to learn the names of common things-names as she seemed
never to have heerd in all her life-till one evenlng come, when she was
 a setting at her window, looking at a little girl at play upon the beach.
 And of a sudden this child held out her hand, and said, what ulould be in
 English, ' Fisherman's daughter, here 'S a shell ! '--for you are to unner-
                                                            L    L   ~
516            THE PERSONAL HISTORY &VD EXPERIENCE

stand that they used at first to call her 'Pretty lady,' as the general way
in that country is, and that she had taught 'em to call her 'Fislier-
man's daughter' instead. The child says of a sudden, 'Fisherman's
daughter, here 'S a shell ! ' Then Em'ly unnerstands her ; and she answers,
bursting out a crying; and it all comes back !
    " When Em'ly got strong again," said Mr. Peggotty, after another short

interval of silence, " she cast about to leave that good young creetur, and
get to her own country. The husband was come home, then; and the
two together put her aboard a small trader bound to Leghorn, and from that
to France. She had a little money, but it was less than little as they
would take for all they done. I 'm a'most glad on it, though they was so
 poor! What they done, is laid up wheer neither moth nor rust doth
 corrupt, and wheer thieves do not break through nor steal. Mas'r Davy,
it 'l1 outlast all the treasure in the wureld.
     " Em'ly got to France, and took service to wait on travelling ladies at

 a inn in the port. Theer, theer come, one day, that snake.-Let him never
 come nigh me. I doen't know what hurt I might do him !-Soon as she
 see him, without him seeing her, all her fear and wildness returned upon
 her, and she fled afore the very breath he draw'd. She come to England,
 and was set ashore at Dover.
     " I doen't know," said &fr. Peggotty, " for sure, when her 'art begun

 to fail her; but all the way to England she had thowt to come to her dear
 home. Soon as she got to England she turned her face tow'rds it. But,
 fear of not being forgiv, fear of being pinted at, fear of some of us being
 dead along of her, fear of many things, turned her from it, kiender by
 force, upon the road: 'Uncle, uncle,' she says to me, 'the fear of not
 being worthy to do, what my torn and bleeding breast so longed to do, was
 the most fright'ning fear of all ! I turned back, when my 'art was full of
 prayers that I might crawl to the old doorstep, in the night, kiss it, lay my
 wicked face upon it, and theer be found dead in the morning.'
     "She come," said Mr. Peggotty, dropping his voice to an awe-stricken
 whisper, " to London. She-as had never seen it in her life-alone-
 without a penny-young-so            pretty-come   to London. A'most the
 moment as she lighted heer, all so desolate, she found (as she believed) a
 friend; a decent woman as spolte to her about the needle-work as she had
 been brought up to do, about finding plenty of it fur her, about a lodging for
 the night, and making secret inquiratiori concerning of me and all at home,
 to-morrow. When my child," he said aloud, and with an energy of
 gratitude that shook him from head to foot, "stood upon the brink
  of more thau I can say or think on-Martha,            trew to her promise,
 saved her ! "
     I could not repress a cry of joy.
     " Mas'r Davy ! " he said, griping my hand in that strong hand of his,

  " it was you as first made mention of her to me. I thankee, sir ! She
  was arnest. She had know'd of her bitter knowledge wheer to watch
  and what to do. She had done it. And the Lord was above all! She
  come, white and hurried, upon Em'ly in her sleep. She says to her,
  ' Rise up from worse thau death, and come with me ! ' Them belonging
  to the house would have stopped her, but they might as soon have stopped
  the sea. ' Stand away from me,' she says, ' I am a ghost that calls her
  from beside her open grave ! ' She told Em'ly she had seen me, and know'd
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

I loved her, and forgiv her. She wrapped her, hasty, in her clothes. She
took her, faint and trembling, on her arm. She heeded no more what they
said, than if she had had no ears. She walked among 'em with my child,
minding only her; and brought her safe out, in the dead of the night,
from that black pit of ruin !
     " She attended on Em'ly," said Mr. Peggotty, who had released my hand,
 and put his own hand on his heaving chest ; " she attended to my Em'ly,
 lying wearied out, and wandering betwixt whiles, till latenest day. Then
 she went in search of me ; then in search of you, Mas'r Davy. She didn't
 tell Em'ly what she come out fur, lest her 'art should fail, and she should
 think of hiding of herself. How the cruel lady know'd of her being theer,
 I can't say. Whether him as I have spoke so much of, chanced to see 'em
going theer, or whether (which is most like, to my thinking) he had heerd
it from the woman, I doen't greatly ask myself. My niece is found.
    "All night long," said Mr. Peggotty, "we have been together, Em'ly
and me. 'Tis little (considering the time) as she has said, in wureds,
through them broken-hearted tears ; 'tis less as I have seen of her dear
face, as grow'd into a woman's at my hearth. But, all night long, her
arms has been about my neck ; and her head has laid heer ; and we knows
full well, as we can put our trust in one another, ever more."
    Ile ceased to speak, and his hand upon the table rested there in perfect
repose, wit,h a resolution in it that might have conquered lions.
    " I t was a gleam of light upon me, Trot," said my aunt, drying her
eyes, "when I formed the resolution of being godmother to your sister
Betsey Trotwood, who disappointed me ; but, next to that, hardly anything
would have given me greater pleasure, than to be godmother to that good
young creature's baby !"
    Mr. Peggotty nodded his understanding of my aunt's feelings, but could
not trust himself with any verbal reference to the subject of her conimen-
dation. We all remained silent, and occupied with our own reflections
(my aunt drying her eyes, and now sobbing convulsively, and now laugh-
ing and calling herself a fool) ; until I spoke.
    "You have quite made up your mind," said I to Mr. Peggotty, "as to
the future, good friend? I need scarcely ask you."
       Quite, Mas'r Davy," he returned ; " and told Em'ly, Theer 'S mighty
countries, fur from heer. Our future life lays over the sea."
    " They will emigrate together, aunt," said I.

    "Yes! " said Mr. Peggotty, with a hopeful smile. "No one can't
reproach my darling i11 Australia. We will begin a new life over theer!"
    I asked him if he yet proposed to himself any time for going away.
    " I was down at the Docks early this morning, sir," he returned, " to

get information concerning of them ships. I n about six weeks or two
months from now, there 'l1 be one sailing-I see her this morning-went
aboard-and we shall take our passage in her."
    " Quite alone ? " I asked.
    " Aye, Mas'r Davy ! " he returned. " My sister, you see, she 'S that fond
of you and yourn, and that accustomed to think on'y of her own country,
that it wouldn't be hardly fair to let her go. Besides which, theer's one
she has in charge, Mas'r Davy, as doen't ought to be forgot."
    " Poor Ham ! " said I.
    'I My good sister takes care of his house, you see, ma'am, and he takes
 518           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  kindly to her," Mr. Peggotty explained for my aunt's better information.
  "He 'l1 set and talk to her, with a calm spirit, wen it 'S like he couldn't
  bring himself to open his lips to another. Poor fellow ! " said Mr. Peg-
 gotty, shaking his head, " theer's not so much left him, that he could spare
 the little as he has ! "
     " And Mrs. Gummidge ? " said I.

     "Well, I 've had a mort of con-sideration, I do tell you," returned Mr.
 Peggotty, with a perplexed look which gradually cleared as he went on,
 "concerning of Missis Gummidge. You see, wen Missis Gummidge
 falls a thinking of the old 'un, she an't what you may call good company.
 Betwixt yon and me, Mas'r Davy-and you, ma'am-wen Mrs. Gummidge
 takes to wimicking,"--our old county word for crying,-" she 'S liable to be
 considered to be, by them as didn't know the old 'un, peevish-like. Now
 I did know the old 'un," said Mr. Peggotty, " and I know'd his merits,
 so I unnerstan' her; but 'tan't entirely so, you see, with others-iiat'rally
 can't be ! "
     I\fy aunt and I both accluiesced.
     " Wheerby," said Mr. Peggotty, " my sister might-I        doen't say she
would, hut might-find Missis Gummidge give her a leetle trouble now-
 and-again. Theerfur 'tan't my intentions to moor Missis Gummidge
 'long with them, but to find a Beein' fixr her wheer she can fisherate fur
herself." (A Beein' signifies, in that dialect, a home, and to fisherate is to
provide.) " Fur which purpose," said Mr. Peggotty, " I means to make
her a 'lowance afore I go, as 'l1 leave her pretty comfort'ble. She's the
faithfullest of creeturs. 'Tan't to be expected, of course, at her time of
life, and being lone and lorn, as the good old Mawther is to be knocked
about aboardship, and in the woods and wilds of a new and fur-away
 country. So that 'S what I 'm a going to do with her."
    He forgot nobody. I-Ie thought of everybody's claims and strivings, but
his own.
    " Em'ly," he continued, "will keep along with me-poor child, she 'S
sore in need of peace and rest !-until such time as we goes upon our
voyage. She'll work at them clothes, as must be made; and I hope
her troubles will begin to seem longer ago than they was, wen she finds
herself once more by her rough hut loving nncle."
    My aunt nodded confirmation of this hope, and imparted great satis-
faction to Mr. Peggotty.
    " Theer 'S one thing furder, Mas'r Davy," said he, putting his hand in
his breast-pocket, and gravely taking out the little paper bundle I had
seen before, which he unrolled on the table. " Theer 'S these here bank-
notes-fifty pound, and ten. To them I wish to add the money as she
come away with. I've asked her about that (but not saying why), and
have added of it LIP. I an't a scholar. Would you be so kind as see
how 'tis ? "
    I-Ie handed me, apologetically for his scholarship, a piece of paper, and
observed me while I looked it over. I t was quite right.
    " Thankee, sir," he said, taking it back. " This money, if you doen't
see objections, Mas'r Davy, I shall put up jest afore I go, in a cover
d'rected to him; and pnt that up in another, d'rected to his mother. I
shall tell her, in no more wureds than I speak to you, what it 'S the price
on ; and that I 'm gone, and past receiving of it back."
                         OF DZ4VID COPPERFIELD.

    I told him that I thought it ~ v o ~ be  ~ l dright to do so-that    I was
thoroughly convinced it would be, since he felt it to be right.
     " I said that theer was on'y one thing furder," he proceeded with a
 grave smile, when he had made up his little bundle again, and put it in
 his pocket; " but theer was two. I warn't sure in my mind, wen I come
 out this morning, as I could go and break to Ham, of my own self, what
 had so thankfully happened. So I writ a letter while I was out, and put
 it in the post-office, telling of 'em how all was as 'tis ; and that I should
 come down to-morrow to unload my mind of what little needs a doing of
 down theer, and, most-like, take my farewell leave of Yarmouth."
     "And do you wish me to go with you? " said I, seeing that he left
 something unsaid.
     " If you could do me that kind favor, Mas'r Davy," he replied, " I

know the sight on you would cheer 'em up a bit."
    My little Dora being in good spirits, and very desirous that I should
go-as I found on talking it over with her-I readily pledged myself to
accompany him in accordance with his wish. Next morning, consequently,
we were on the Yarmouth coach, and again travelling over the old ground.
    As we passed along the familiar street at night-Nr.           Peggotty, in
despite of all my remonstrances, carrying my bag-I glanced into Omer
and Joram's shop, and saw my old friend Mr. Omer there, smoking his
pipe. I felt reluctant to be present, when Mr. Peggotty first met his
sister and Ham ; and made Mr. Omer my excuse for lingering behind.
    " How is Mr. Omer, after this long time ? " said I , going in.
    He fanned away the smoke of his pipe, that he might get a better view
of me, and soon recognised me with great delight.
    " I should get up, sir, to acknowledge such an honor as this visit,"
said he, " only my limbs are rather out of sorts, and I am wheeled about.
With the exception of my limbs and my breath, hows'ever, I am as hearty
as a man can be, I'm thankful to say."
    I congratulated him on his contented looks and his good spirits, and
saw, now, that his easy chair went on wheels.
    " I t 'S an ingenious thing, ain't it ? " he inquired, following the direc-

tion of my glance, and polishing the elbow with his arm. " I t runs as
light as a feather, and tracks as true as a mall-coach. Bless you, my
little llinnie-my     grand-daughter you know, Minnie's child--puts her
little strength against the back, gives it a shove, and away we go, as clever
and merry as ever you see anythmg! And I tell you what-it 'S a most
uncommon chair to smoke a pipe in."
    I never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing, and
find out the enjoyment of it, as Mr. Omer. I-Ie was as radiant, as if his
chair, his asthma, and the failure of his limbs, were the various branches
of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe.
    " I see more of the world, I can assure you," said Mr. Omer, "in this
chair, than ever I see out of it. You'd be surprised at the number of
people that looks in of a day to have a chat. You really would! There's
twice as much in the newspaper, since I've taken to this chair, as there
used to be. As to general reading, dear me, what a lot of it I do
get through! That 'S what I feel so strong, you know ! If it had
been my eyes, what should I have done? If it had been my ears, what
should I have done? Being my limbs, what does it signify? Why, my
                THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

limbs only made my breath shorter when I used 'em. And now, if I
want to go out into the street or down to the sands, I've only got to call
Dick, Joram's youngest 'prentice, and away I go in my own carriage, like
the Lord Mayor of London."
   He half suffocated himself with laughing here.
   " Lord bless yon ! " said Mr. Omer, resuming his pipe, " a man must
take the fat with the lean ; that 'S what he must make up his mind to, in
this life. Joram does a fine business. Ex-cellent business ! "
   " I am very glad to hear it," said I.
    " I knew you would be," said Mr. Omer. "And Joram and Minnie are
like Valentines. What more can a man expect? What 'S his limbs to
that !"
   His supreme contempt for his own limbs, as he sat smoking, was one
of the pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered.
   "And since I 've took to general reading, you 've took to general writ-
ing, eh, sir?" said Mr. Omer, surveying me admiringly. "What a lovely
work that was of yours ! What expressions in it ! I read it every word
-every word. And as to feeling sleepy ! Not at all ! "
   I laughingly expressed my satisfaction, but I must confess that I thought
this association of ideas significant.
   " I give you my word and honor, sir," said Mr. Omer, " that when I

lay that book upon the table, and look at it outside; compact in three
separate and indiwidual wollumes-one, two, three ; I am as proud as
Punch to think that I once had the honor of being connected with your
family. And dear me, it's a long time ago, now, an't i t ? Over at Blun-
derstone. With a pretty little party laid along with the other party. And
you quite a small party then, yourself. Dear, dear ! "
   I changed the subject by referring to Emily. After assuring him that
I did not forget how interested he had always been in her, and how
kindly he had always treated her, I gave him a general account of her
restoration to her uncle by the aid of Martha ; which I knew would please
the old man. He listened with the utmost attention, and said, feelingly,
when I had done :
   " I am rejoiced at it, sir !   I t 'S the best news I have heard for many
a day. Dear, dear, dear ! And what 'S going to be undertook for that
unfortunate young woman, Martha, now ? "
   " You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since
yesterday," said I, "but on which I can give you no information yet,
Mr. Omer. Mr. Peggotty has not alluded to it, and I have a delicacy in
doing so. I am sure he has not forgotten it. He forgets nothing that is
disinterested and good."
   " Because you know," said Mr. Omer, taking himself upJ where he had
left off, " whatever is done, I should wish to be a member of. P u t me down
for anything you may consider right, and let me know. I never could
think the girl all bad, and I am glad to find she's not. So will my
daughter Minnie be. Young women are contradictory creatures in some
things-her mother was just the same as her-but            their hearts are soft
and kind. I t 'S all show with Minnie, about Martha. Why she should
consider it necessary to make any show, I don't undertake to tell you.
But it 'S all show, bless you. She'd do her any kindness in private. So,
put me down for whatever you may consider right, will you be so good?
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            521
and drop me a line where to forward it. Dear me! " said Mr. Omer,
" when a man is drawing on to a time of life, where the two ends of life

meet ; when he finds himself, however hearty he is, being wheeled about for
the second time, in a speeches of go-cart ; he should be over-rejoiced to
do a kindness if he can. He wants plenty. And I don't speak of myself,
particular," said Mr. Omer, "because, sir, the way I look at it is, that
we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill, whatever age we are, on
account of time never standing still for a single moment. So let us always
do a kindness, and be over-rejoiced. To be sure ! "
   He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and put it on a ledge in the back
of his chair, expressly made for its reception.
    " There 'S Em'ly's cousin, him that she was to have been married to,"

said Mr. Omer, rubbing his hands feebly, "as fine a fellow as there is in
Yarmouth ! H e 'l1 come and talk or read to me, in the evening, for an
hour together sometimes. That 'S a kindness, I should call it ! All his
life 'S a kindness."
    "I am going to see him now," said I.
   "Are you? " said Mr. Omer. "Tell him I was hearty, and sent my
respects. Minnie and Joram's at a ball. They would be as proud to
see you as I am, if they was at home. Minnie won't hardly go out at
all, you see, ' on account of father,' as she says. So I swore to-night, that
if she didn't go, I ' d go to bed at six. I n consequence of which," Mr.
Omer shook himself and his chair, with laughter at the success of his device,
"she and Joram 'S at a ball."
   I shook hands with him, and wished him good night.
    "Half a minute, sir," said Mr. Omer. "If you was to go without
seeing my little elephant, you 'd lose the best of sights. You never see
such a sight ! Minnie ! "
   A musical little voice answered, from somewhere upstairs, " I am coming,
grandfather ! " and a pretty little girl with long, flaxen, curling hair, soon
came running into the shop.
   "This is my little elephant, sir," said Mr. Omer, fondling the child.
" Siamese breed, sir.     Now, little elephant ! "
    The little elephant set the door of the parlor open, enabling me to see
that, in these latter days, it was converted into a bedroom for Mr. Omer,
who could not be easily conveyed upstairs; and then hid her pretty
forehead, and tumbled her long hair, against the back of Mr. Omer's
chair.
    " The elephant butts, you know, sir," said Mr. Omer, winking, " when
he goes at a object. Once, elephant. Twice. Three times ! "
    At this signal, the little elephant, with a dexterity that was next to mar-
vellous in so small an animal, whisked the chair round with Mr. Omer in it,
and rattled it off, pell-mell, into the parlor, without touching the doorpost :
Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying the performance, and looking back at
me on the road as if it were the triumphant issue of his life's exertions.
    After a stroll about the town, I went to Ham's house. Peggotty had
now removed here for good ; and had let her own house to the successor
of Mr. Barkis in the carrying business, who had paid her very well for
the good-will, cart, and horse. I believe the very same slow horse that
Mr. Barkis drove, was still at work.
    I found them in the neat kitchen, accompanied by Mrs. Gummidge, who
522           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

had been fetched from the old boat by l4r. Peggotty himself. I doubt if
she could have been induced to desert her post, by any one else. He had
evidently told them all. Both Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge had their
aprons to their eyes, and Ham had just stepped out "to take a turn on
the beach." He presently came home, very glad to see me; and I hope
they were all the better for my being there. We spoke, with some
approach to cheerfulness, of Mr. Peggotty's growing rich in a new
country, and of the wonders he would describe in his letters. We said
nothing of Emily by name, but distantly referred to her more than once.
Ham was the serenest of the party.
    But, Peggotty told me, when she lighted me to a little chamber where
the Crocodile book was lying ready for me on the table, that he always was
the same. She believed (she told me, crying) that he was broken-hearted ;
though he was as full of courage as of sweetness, and worked harder and
better than any boat-builder in any yard in all that part. There were
times, she said, of an evening, when he talked of their old life in the boat-
house ; and then he mentioned Emily as a child. But, he never mentioned
her as a woman.
    I thought 1 had read in his face that he would like to speak to me
alone. I therefore resolved to put myself in his way next evening, as he
came home from his work. Having settled this with myself, I fell asleep.
That night, for the first time in all those many nights, the candle was
taken out of the window, Mr. Peggotty swung in his old hammock in the
old boat, and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head.
    All next day, he was occupied in disposing of his fishing-boat and
tackle; in packing up, and sending to London by waggon, such of his
little domestic possessions as he thought would be useful to him ; and in
parting with the rest, or bestowing them oil Mrs. Gummidge. She was
with him all day. As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once
more, before it was locked up, I engaged to meet them there in the
evening. But I so arranged it, as that I should meet Ham first.
    I t was easy to come in his way, as I knew where he worked. I met
him at a retired part of the sands, which I knew he would cross, and
turned back with him, that he might have leisure to speak to me if he
really wished. I had not inistaken the expression of his face. We had
walked but a little way together, when he said, without looking at me :
    " Mas'r Davy, have you seen her ? "

    " Only for a moment, when she was in a swoon," I softly answered.
    We walked a little farther, and he said :
    " Mas'r Davy, shall you see her, d   ' ye think? "
    " I t would be too painful to her, perhaps," said I.
    "I have thowt of that," he replied. " So 'twould, sir, so 'twould."
    " But, Ham,"    said I, gently, "if there is anything that I could write
to her, for you, in case I could not tell it ; if there is anything you would
wish to make known to her through me ; Ishould consider it a sacred trust."
    " I am sure on 't.   I thankee, sir, most kind ! I think theer is some-
 thing I could wish said or wrote."
    " What is it ? "
    We walked a little farther in silence, and then he spoke.
    " 'Tan't that I forgive her. 'Tan't that so much. 'Tis more as I beg
of her to forgive me, for having pressed my affections upoil her. Odd
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            523
  times, I think that if I hadn't had her promise fur to marry me, sir, she
  was that trustful of me, in a friendly way, that she 'd have told me what
 was struggling in her mind, and would have counselled with me, and I
 might have saved her."
     I pressed his hand. " Is that all ? "
     " Theer 'S yet a something else," he returned, 'lif I can say it, Mas'r

 Davv."
    @e walked on, farther than we had walked yet, before he spoke again.
 He was not crying when he made the pauses I shall express by lines. He
 was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly.
    "I loved her-and I love the mem'ry of her-too deep-to be able to
 lead her to believe of my own self as I 'm a happy man. I could only be
 happy-by forgetting of her-and I ' m afeerd I couldn't hardly bear as
 she should be told I done that. But if you, being so f ~ ~of     l l learning,
 Mas'r Davy, could think of anything to say as might bring her to be-
 lieve I wasn't greatly hurt : still lovlng of her, and mourning for her:
 anything as might bring her to beliere as I was not tired of my life, and
 yet was hoping fur to see her without blame, wheer the wicked cease from
 troubling and the weary are at rest-anything as would ease her sorrowful
 mind, and yet not make her think as 1 could ever marry, or as 'twas
possible that any one could ever be to me what she was-I should ask of
you to say that-with my prayers for her-that was so dear."
    I pressed his manly hand again, and told him I would charge myself to
do this as well as I could.
    " I thankee, sir," he answered. '"T\vas kind of you to meet me.
'Twas kind of you to bear him company down. Mas'r Davg, I unnerstan'
very well, though my aunt will come to Lon'oii afore they sail, and they'll
unite once more, that I am not like to see him agen. I fare to feel sure
on't. We doen't say so, but so 'twill be, and better so. The last you
see on him-the very last-will you give him the lovingest duty and
thanks of the orphan, as he was ever more than a father t o ? "
    This I also promised, faithfully.
    " I thankee again, sir," he said, heartily shaking hands.        " I know

wheer you're a going. Good bye ! "
    With a slight wave of his hand, as though to explain to me that he
could not enter the old place, lie turned away. As I looked after his
figure, crossing the waste in the moonlight, I saw him turn his face
towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea, and pass on, looking at it,
until he was a shadow in the distance.
    The door of the boat-house stood open when I approached ; and, on
entering, I found it emptied of all its furniture, saving one of the old
lockers, on which Mrs. Gummidge, with a basket on her knee, was seated,
looking at Mr. Peggotty. He leaned his elbow oil the rough chimney-piece,
and gazed upon a few expiring embers in the grate; but he raised his
head, hopefully, on my coming in, and spoke in a cheery manner.
    " Come, according to promise, to bid farewell to 't, eh, Mas'r Davy ! "

he said, taking up the candle. " Bare enough now, an't it ? "
    " Indeed you have made good use of the time," said I.

    " Why we have not been idle, sir. Missis Gummidge has worked like
a-I doen't know what Missis Gummidge ain't worked like," said Mr.
Peggotty, looking at her, at a loss for a sufficiently-approving simile.
524           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

   Mrs. Gummidge, leaning on her basket, made no observation.
   " Theer 'S the very locker that you used to sit on, 'long with Em'ly ! "

said Mr. Peggotty, in a whisper. " I 'm a going to carry it away with
me, last of all. And heer 'S your old little bedroom, see, Mas'r Davy !
b'most as bleak to-night, as 'art could wish ! "
   I n truth, the wind, though it was low, had a solemn sound, and crept
around the deserted house with a whispered wailing that was very mourn-
ful. Everything was gone, down to the little mirror with the oyster-shell
frame. I thought of myself, lying here, when that first great change was
being wrought at home. I thought of the blue-eyed child who had
enchanted me. I thought of Steerforth : and a foolish, fearful fancy came
upon me of his being near at hand, and liable to be met at any turn.
    " 'Tis like to be long," said Mr. Peggotty, in a low voice, "afore the
boat finds new tenants. They look upon 't, down heer, as being unfort'-
nate now ! "
    " Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood ? " I asked.

   "To a mast-maker up town," said Mr. Peggotty. " I ' m a going to
give the key to him to-night."
   We looked into the other little room, and came back to Mrs. Gummidge,
sitting on the locker, whom Mr. Peggotty, putting the light on the
chimney-piece, requested to rise, that he might carry it outside the door
before extinguishing the candle.
   "Dan'l," said Mrs. Gummidge, suddenly deserting her basket, and
clinging to his arm, "my dear Dan'l, the parting words I speak in this
house is, I mustn't be left behind. Doen't ye think of leaving me behind,
Dan'l ! Oh, doen't ye ever do it ! "
   Mr. Peggotty, taken aback, looked from Mrs. Gummidge to me, and
from me to Mrs. Gummidge, as if he had been awakened from a sleep.
   " Doen't ye, dearest Dan'l, doen't ye ! " cried Mrs. Gummidge, fervently.

" Take me 'long with you, Dan'l, take me 'long with you and Em'ly !

I'll be your servant, constant and trew. If there 'S slaves in them parts
where you 're a going, I'll be bound to you for one, and happy, but doen't
ye leave me behind, Dan'l, that 'S a deary dear ! "
   "My good soul," said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, "you doen't
know what a long voyage, and what a hard life 'tis ! "
   " Yes I do, Dan'l ! I can guess ! " cried Mrs. Gummidge. " But my
parting words under this roof is, I shall go into the house and die, if I am
not took. I can dig, Dan'l. I can work. I can live hard. I can be
loving and patient now-more than you think, Dan'l, if you 'l1 on'y try
me. I wouldn't touch the 'lowance, not if I was dying of want, Dan'l
Peggotty ; but I 'U go with you and Em'ly, if you 'l1 on'y let me, to the
world's end ! I know how 'tis ; I know you think that I am lone and
lorn; but, deary love, 'tan't so no more! I an't sat here, so long, a
watching, and a thinking of your trials, without some good being done
me. Mas'r Davy, speak to him for me ! I knows his ways, and Em'ly's,
and I knows their sorrows, and can be a comfort to 'em, some odd times,
and labor for 'em allus ! Dan'l, deary Dan'l, let me go 'long with you ! "
   And Mrs. Gummidge took his hand, and kissed it with a homely pathos
and affection, in a homely rapture of devotion and gratitude, that he well
deserved.
   We brought the locker out, extinguished the candle, fastened the door on

the outside, and left the old boat close shut up, a dark speck in the cloudy
night. Next day, when we were returning to London outside the coach,
Mrs. Guinmidge and her basket were on the seat behind, and Airs. Gum-
midge was happy.



                            CHAPTER LII.
                      I ASSIST AT AN EXPLOSION.
WHENthe time Mr. Micawber had appointed so mysteriously, was within
four-and-twenty hours of being come, my aunt and I consulted how we
should proceed ; for my aunt was very unwilling to leave Dora. Ah ! how
easily I carried Dora up and down stairs, now !
   We were disposed, notwithstanding Mr. Micawber's stipulation for my
aunt's attendance, to arrange that she should stay at home, and be repre-
sented by Mr. Diclc and me. I n short, we had resolved to take this course,
when Dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would forgive
herself, and never would forgive her bad boy, if my aunt remained behind,
on any pretence.
   " I won't speak to you," said Dora, shaking her curls at my aunt.
" I 'l1 be disagreeable ! I 'l1 make Jip bark at you all day.    I shall be
sure that you really are a cross old thing, if you don't go ! "
   " Tut, Blossom! " laughed my aunt.           " You know you can't do
without me ! "
   " Yes, I can," said Dora. "You are no use to me at all. You never
run up and down stairs for me, all day long. You never sit and tell me
stories about Doady, when his shoes were worn out, and lie was covered
with dust-oh, what a poor little mite of a fellow ! You never do any-
thing at all to please me, do you, dear ? " Dora made haste to kiss my
aunt, and say, " Yes, you do ! I 'm only joking ! "-lest my aunt should
think she really meant it.
   '' But, aunt," said Dora, coaxingly, " now listen. You must go. I
shall tease you, 'till you let me have my own way about it. I shall lead
my naughty boy such a life, if he don't make you go. I shall make myself
so disagreeable-and so will Jip ! You 'l1 wish you had gone, like a good
thing, for ever and ever so long, if you don't go. Besides," said Dora,
putting back her hair, and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me,
 " why shouldn't you both go? I am not very ill indeed. Am I ? "
    " Why, what a question ! " cried my aunt.
    " What a fancy ! " said I.

    " Yes ! I know I am a silly little thing ! " said Dora, slowly looking

from one of us to the other, and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us
 as she lay upon her couch. "Well, then, you must both go, or I shall not
 believe you; and then I shall cry! "
    I saw, in my aunt's face, that she began to give way now, and Dora
 brightened again, as she saw it too.
    " You'll come back with so much to tell me, that it 'l1 take at least a

 week to make me understand ! " said Dora. " Because I lc~zozo I sha'n't
 understand, for a length of time, if there 'S any business in it. And
 there 'S sure to be some business in it ! If there 'S any thing to add up,
526             THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 besides, I don't know when I shall make it out ; and my bad boy will look
 so miserable all the time. There ! Now you 'l1 go, won't you ? You 'll
 only be gone one night, and Jip will take care of me while you are gone.
 Doady will carry me up stairs before you go, and I won't come down
 again till you come back; and you shall take Agnes a dreadfully scolding
 letter from me, because she has never been to see us ! "
    We agreed, without any more consultation, that we would both go, and
 that Dora was a little Impostor, who feigned to be rather unwell, because
 she liked to be petted. She was greatly pleased, and very merry ; and we
 four, that is to say, my aunt, Mr. Dick, Traddles, and I, went down to
 Canterbury by the Dover mail that night.
    At the hotel where Mr. Micawber had requested us to await him, which
 we got into, with some trouble, in the middle of thc night, I found a
 letter, importing that he would appear in the morning punctually at half-
 past nine. After which, we went shivering, at that uncomfortable hour, to
 our respective beds, through various close passages; which smelt as if they
 had been steeped, for ages, in a solution of soup and stables.
    Early in the morning, I sauntered through the dear old tranquil streets,
 and again mingled with the shadows of the venerable gateways and
 churches. The rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers; and the
towers themselves, overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich
country and its pleasant streams, were cutting the bright morning air, as
if there were no such thing as change on earth. Yet the bells, when they
sounded, told me sorrowfully of change in everything; told me of their
own age, and my pretty Dora's youth ; and of the many, never old, who had
lived and loved and died, while the reverberations of the bells had hummed
through the rusty armour of the Black Prince hanging up within, and,
motes upon the deep of Time, had lost themselves in air, as circles do in
water.
    I looked at the old house from the corner of the street, but did not go
nearer to it, lest, being observed, I might unwittingly do any harm to the
design I had come to aid. The early sun was striking edgewise on its
gables and lattice-windows, touching them with gold; and some beams
of its old peace seemed to touch my heart.
    I strolled into the country for an hour or so, and then r e t ~ ~ r n eby
                                                                            d the
main street, which in the interval had shaken off its last night's sleep.
Among those who were stirring in the shops, I saw my ancient enemy the
butcher, now advanced to top-boots and a baby, and in business for himself.
He was nursing the baby, and appeared to be a benignant member of society.
   We all became very anxious and impatient, when we sat down to break-
fast. As it approached nearer and nearer to half-past nine o'clock, our restless
expectation of Mr. Micawber increased. At last we made no more pre-
tence of attending to the meal, which, except with Mr. Dick, had been a
mere form from the first ; but my aunt walked np and down the room,
Traddles sat upon the sofa affecting to read the paper with his eyes on
the ceiling; and I looked out of the window to give early notice of Mr.
Micawber's coming. Nor had I long to watch, for, at the first chime of
the half hour, he appeared in the street.
    " Here he is," said I, " and not in his legal attire ! "
   My aunt tied the strings of her bonnet (she had come down to breakfast
in it), and put on her shawl, as if she were ready for anything that was
                         OP DAVID COPPERFIELD,

 resolute and uncompromising. Traddles buttoned his coat with a deter-
 mined air. Mr. Dick, disturbed by these formidable appearances, but feeling
 it necessary to imitate them, pulled his hat, with both hands, as firmly over
 his ears as he possibly could ; and instantly took it off again, to welcome
 Mr. Micawber.
       Gentlemen, and madam," said Mr. Micawber, "good morning ! My
 dear sir," to Mr. Dick, who shook hands with him violently, you are
 extremely good."
     " Have you breakfasted ? " said Mr. Dick. '' Have a chop !"
     "Not for the world, my good sir ! " cried Mr. Micawber, stopping him
 on his way to the bell; "appetite and myself, Mr. Dixon, have long been
 strangers."
    Mr. Dixon was so pleased with his new name, and appeared to think it
 so very obliging in Mr. Micawber to confer it upon him, that he shook
 hands with him again, and laughed rather childishly.
     " Dick," said my aunt, " attention ! "
    Mr. Dick recovered himself, with a blush.
   '$  Now, sir," said my aunt to Mr. Micawber, as she put on her gloves,
 "we are ready for Mount Vesuvius, or anything else, as soon as you
 please."
     " Madam," returned Mr. Micawber, "I trust you will shortly witness
 an eruption. Mr. Traddles, I have your permission, I believe, to mention
 here that we have been in communication together P "
     "It is undoubtedly the fact, Copperfield," said Traddles, to whom I
 looked in surprise. "Mr. Micawber has consulted me, in reference to
what he has in contemplation; and I have advised him to the best of my
judgment."
    "Unless I deceive myself, Mr. Traddles," pursued Mr. Micawber,
"what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature."
    "Highly SO," said Traddles.
    "Perhaps, under such circumstances, madam and gentlemen," said
 Mr. Micawber, "you will do me the favor to submit yourselves, for the
 moment, to the direction of one, who, however unworthy to be regarded in
 any other light but as a Waif and Stray upon the shore of human nature, is
 still your fellow man, though crushed out of his original form by individual
 errors, and the accumulati.r~eforce of a combination of circumstances ? "
    "We have perfect confidence in you, Mr. Micawber," said I, " and will
 do what you please."
    " Mr. Copperfield," returned Mr. Micawber, " your confidence is not,
 at the existing juncture, ill-bestowed. I would beg to be allowed a start
 of five minutes by the clock; and then to receive the present company,
inquiring for Miss Wickfield, at the office of Wickfield and Heep, whose
 Stipendiary I am."
    My aunt and I looked at Traddles, who nodded his approval.
    " I have no more," observed Mr. Micawber, "to say at present."
    With which, to my infinite surprise, he included us all in a comprehen-
 sive bow, and disappeared ; his manner being extremely distant, and his
face extremely pale.
    Traddles only smiled, and shook his head (with his hair standing
upright on the top of it), when I looked to him for an explanation;
 so I took out my watch, and, as a last resource, counted off the five
528           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

minutes. My aunt, with her own watch in her hand, did the like. When the
time was expired, Traddles gave her his arm ; and we all went out together
to the old house, without saying one word on the way.
   We found Mr. Micawher at his desk, in the turret office on the ground
floor, either writing, or pretending to write, hard. The large office-ruler
was stuck into his waistcoat, and was not so well concealed but that a
foot or more of that instrument protruded from his bosom, like a new kind
of shirt-frill.
   As it appeared to me that I was expected to speak, I said aloud :
   " How do you do, Mr. Micawber ? "
   " Mr. Copperfield," said Mr. Micawber, gravely, "I hope I see you well?"
   " I s Miss Wickfield at home ? " said I.
   "Mr. Wickfield is unwell in bed, sir, of arheumatic fever," he returned ;
" but Miss Wickfield, I have no doubt, will be happy to see old friends.
Will you walk in, sir ? "
   He preceded us to the dining-room-the first room I had entered in
that house-and flinging open the door of Mr. Wickfield's former office,
said, in a sonorous voice :
   " Miss Trotwood, Mr. David Copperfield, Mr. Thomas Traddles, and

Mr. Dixon ! "
   I had not seen Uriah Heep since the time of the blow. Our visit
astonished him, evidently ; not the less, I dare say, because it astonished
ourselves. He did not gather his eyebrows together, for he had none
worth mentioning; but he frowned to that degree that he almost closed his
small eyes, while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to his chin betrayed
some trepidation or surprise. This was only when we were in the act of
entering his room, and when I caught a glance at him over my aunt's
shoulder. A moment afterwards, he was as fawning and as humble as ever.
   "Well, I am sure," he said. " This is indeed an unexpected pleasure !
To have, as I may say, all friends round Saint Paul's, at once, is a treat
unlooked for ! Mr. Copperfield, I hope I see you well, and-if          I may
umbly express self so-friendly towards them as is ever your friends,
whether or not. Mrs. Copperfield, sir, I hope she 'S getting on. We have
been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state,
lately, I do assure you."
   I felt ashamed to let him take my hand, but I did not know yet what
else to do.
   " Things are changed in this office, Miss Trotwood, since I was a numble

clerk, and held your pony ; ain't they? " said Uriah, with his sickliest
smile. " But I am not changed, Miss Trotwood,"
   "Well, sir," returned my aunt, "to tell you the truth, I think you are
pretty constant to the promise of your youth; if that 'S any satisfaction
to you."
   " Thank you, Miss Trotwood,"        said Uriah, writhing in his ungainly
manner, " for your good opinion ! Micawber, tell 'em to let Jliss Agnes
know-and mother. Mother will be quite in a state, when she sees the
present company ! " said Uriah, setting chairs.
   " You are not busy, Mr. Heep ? " said Traddles, whose eye the cunning
red eye accidentally canght, as it at once scrutinised and evaded us.
    "No, Mr. Traddles," replied Uriah, resuming his official seat, and
 squeezing his bony hands, laid palm to palm, between his bony knees.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            529
 "Not so much so, as I could wish. But lawyers, sharks, and leeches, are
 not easily satisfied, you know! Not but what myself and Micawber have
 our hands pretty full, in general, on account of Mr. Wickfield's being
 hardly fit for any occupation, sir. But it 'S a pleasure as well as a duty, I
 am sure, to work for him. You 've not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield,
 I think, Mr. Traddles ? I believe I 've only had the honor of seeing you
 once myself ? "
         No, I have not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield," returned Traddles ;
 'l or I might perhaps have waited on yon long ago, Mr. Heep."

      There was something in the tone of this reply, which made Uriah look
 at the speaker again, with a very sinister and suspicious expression. But,
 seeing only Traddles with his good-natured face, simple manner, and hair
 on end, he dismissed it as he replied, with a jerk of his whole body, but
 especially his throat :
      " I am sorry for that, Mr. Traddles. You would have admired him as
 much as we all do. His little failings would only have endeared him to you
themore. But if you ~ ~ o u l d l ito
                                   k ehear my fellow-partner eloquently spoken
 of, I should refer you to Copperfield. The family is a subject he 'S very
 strong upon, if you never heard him."
      I was prevented from disclaiming the compliment (if I should have
done so, in any case), by the entrance of Agnes, now ushered in by Mr.
Micawber. She was not quite so self-possessed as usual, I thought; and had
evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue. But her earnest cordiality, and
her quiet beauty, shone with the gentler lustre for it.
      I saw Uriah watch her while she greeted us; and he reminded me of
an ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit. I n the meanwhile,
some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and
Traddles, unobserved except by me, went out.
     "Don't wait, Micawber," said Uriah.
    Mr. Micawber, with his hand upon the ruler in his breast, stood erect
before the door, most unmistakeably contemplating one of his fellow-men,
and that man his employer.
     " What are you waiting for? " said Uriah. " Micawber ! Did you hear
me tell you not to wait? "
     "Yes ! " replied the immovable Mr. Micawber.
     " Then why do you wait ? " said Uriah.

     "Because I-in      short choose," replied Mr. Micawber, with a burst.
    Uriah's cheeks lost colour, and an unwholesome paleness, still faintly
tinged by his pervading red, overspread them. H e looked at Mr. Micawber
attentively, with his whole face breathing short and quick in every feature.
    "' ou are a dissipated fellow, as all the world knows," he said, with an
effort at a smile, " and I am afraid you'll oblige me to get rid of you. Go
along ! I'll talk to you presently."
    "If there is a scoundrel on this earth," said Mr. Micawber, suddenly
breaking out again with the utmost vehemence, " with whom I have already
talked too much, that scoundrel's name is-HEEP ! "
    Uriah fell back, as if he had been struck or stung. Looking slowly
round upon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his face
could wear, he said, in a lower voice :
    " Oho !     This is a conspiracy ! You have met here, by appointment !
You are playing Booty with my clerk, are you, Copperfield? Now, take
                                                             M M

  care. You '11 make nothing of this. We understand each other, you and
  me. There's no love between us. You were always a puppy with a
  proud stomach, from your first coming here ; and you envy me my rise, do
  you? None of your plots against me; I 1' 1 counterplot you! Micawber,
  you be off'. I 'l1 talk to you presently."
     " Mr. Micawber," said I, " there is a sudden change in this fellow, in
  more respects than the extraordinary one of his speaking the truth in one
 particular, which assures me that he is brought to bay. Deal with him
 as he deserves ! "
     "You are a precious set of people, ain't you?" said Uriah, in the
 same low voice, and breaking out into a clammy heat, which he wiped
 from his forehead, with his long lean hand, " to buy over my clerk, who
 is the very scum of society,-as you yourself were, Copperfield, you know
 it, before anyone had charity on you,-to defame me with his lies ?
 Miss Trotwood,. you had better stop this; or I'll stop your husband
 shorter than w ~ l lbe pleasant to you. I won't know your story profes-
 sionally, for nothing, old lady ! Miss Wickfield, if you have any love for
 your father, you had better not join that gang. I'll ruin him, if you do.
 Now, come! I have got some of you under the harrow. Think twice,
 before it goes over you. Think twice, you, Micawber, if you don't want
 to be crushed. I recommend you to take yourself off, and be talked to
 presently, you fool ! while there 'S time to retreat. Where 'S mother ! "
 he said, suddenly appearing to notice, with alarm, the absence of Traddles,
 and pulling down the bell-rope. "Fine doings in a person's own
house !"
    " Nrs. Heep is here, sir," said Traddles, returning with that worthy

mother of a worthy son. " I have taken the liberty of making myself
known to her."
    " Who are you to make yourself known ? " retorted Uriah. " And
what do you want here? "
    "I am the agent and friend of Mr Wickfield, sir," said Traddles, in a
composed business-like way. "And I have a power of attorney from him
in my pocket, to act for him in all matters."
    " The old ass has drunk himself into a state of dotage," said Uriah,
                                                                               '
turning uglier than before, " and it has been got from him by fraud ! "
    "Something has been got from him by fraud, I know," returned
Traddles quietly ; " and so do you, Mr. Heep. We will refer that question,
if you please, to Mr. Micawber."
    " Ury- !" Mrs. Heep began, with an anxious gesture.
    " You hold your tongue, mother," he returned ; " least said, soonest
mended."
    "But my Ury-."
    " Will you hold your tongue, mother, and leave it to me ? "

    Though I had long known that his servility was false, and all his pre-
tences knavish and hollow, I had had no adequate conception of the
extent of his hypocrisy, until I now saw him with his mask off. The
suddenness with which he dropped it, when he perceived that it was use-
less to him ; the malice, insolence, and hatred, he revealed; the leer with
which he exulted, even at this moment, in the evil he had done-
all this time being desperate too, and at his wits' end for the means
of getting the better of us-though perfectly consistent with the expe-
                          OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            531
   rience I had of him, at first took even me by surprise, who had known
   him so long, and disliked him so heartily.
       I say nothing of the look he conferred on me, as he stood eyeing us,
   one after another; for I had always understood that he hated me, and I
   remembered the marks of my hand upon his cheek. But when his eyes
   passed on to Agnes, and I saw the rage with which he felt his power over
   her slipping away, and the exhibition, in their disappointment, of the
   odious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues he could
   never appreciate or care for, I was shocked by the mere thought of her
  having lived, an hour, within sight of such a man.
      After some rubbing of the lower part of his face, and some looking at
  us with those bad eyes, over his grisly fingers, he made one more address
  to me, half whining, and half abusive.
      'S You think it justifiable, do you, Copperfield, you who pride yourself

  so much on your honor and all the rest of it, to sneak about my place,
  eaves-dropping with my clerk? If it had been me, I shouldn't have
  wondered; for I don't make myself out a gentleman (though I never was
  in the streets either, as you were, according to Micawber), but being you !
  -And you're not afraid of doing this, either? You don't think at all of
  what I shall do, in return ; or of getting yourself into trouble for conspiracy
  and so forth? Very well. We shall see ! Mr. What's-your-name, you
  were going to refer some question to Micawber. There 'S your referee.
  Why don't you make him speak? He has learnt his lesson, I see."
      Seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us, he sat on the
 edge of his table with his hands in his pockets, and one of his splay feet
 twisted round the other leg, waiting doggedly for what might follow.
     Mr. Micawber, whose impetuosity I had restrained thus far with the
 greatest difficulty, and who had repeatedly interposed with the first syllable
 of S~OUN-drel     ! without getting to the second, now burst forward, drew
 the ruler from his breast (apparently as a defensive weapon), and produced
 from his pocket a foolscap document, folded in the form of a large letter.
 Opening this packet, with his old flourish, and glancing at the contents,
 as if he cherished an artistic admiration of their style of composition,
 he began to read as follows :
     " 'Dear Miss Trotwood and gentlemen -' "
     " Bless and save the man ! " exclaimed my aunt in a low voice. c c He 'd
 write letters by the ream, if it was a capital offence ! "
     Mr. Micawber, without hearing her, went on.
     " ' In appearing before you to denounce probably the most consummate
Villain that has ever existed,' " Mr. Micawber, without looking off the
letter, pointed the ruler, like a ghostly truncheon, at Uriah Weep, " ' I ask
no consideration for myself. The victim, from my cradle, of pecuniary
liabilities to which I have been unable to respond, I have ever been the sport
and toy of debasing circumstances. Ignominy, Want, Despair, and Mad-
ness, have, collectively or separately, been the attendants of my career.' "
    The relish with which Mr. Micawber described himself, as a prey to
these dismal calamities, was only to be equalled by the emphasis with
which he read his letter; and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a
roll of his head, when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed.
    " ' I n an accumulation of Ignominy, Want, Despair, and Madness, I
entered the office-or, as our lively neighbour the Gaul would term it,
                                                             M M 2
532           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

the Bureau-of the Firm, nominally condncted under the appellation of
Wickfield and-Hz~r, but, in reality, wielded by--I%~Er alone. HEEP,
and only WEEP, is the mainspring of that machine, HEEP, and only
HEEP, is the Forger and the Cheat.'"
    Uriah, more blue than white at these words, made a dart at the letter,
as if to tear it in pieces. m. Micawber, with a perfect miracle of dex-
terity or luck, caught his advancing knuckles with the ruler, and disabled
his right hand. I t dropped at the wrist, as if it were broken. The blow
sounded as if it had fallen on wood.
    " The Devil take you ! " said Uriah, writhing in a new way with pain.
" I'll be even with you."
    "Approach me again, you-you-you          HEEP of infamy," gasped Mr.
Micawber, " and if your head is human, I'll break it. Come on, come on ! "
    I think I never saw anything more ridiculous-I was sensible of it,
even at the time-than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards with
the ruler, and crying "Come on!" while Traddles and I pushed him
back into a corner, from which, as often as we got him into it, he persisted
in emerging again.
    His enemy, muttering to himself, after wringing his wounded hand for
some time, slowly drew 08his neck-kerchief and bound it up ; then, held it
in his other hand, and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down.
    IIr. Ihcawber, when he was sufficiently cool, proceeded with his letter.
    " 'The stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which I entered into
the service of-BEEP,' " always pausing before that word, and uttering it
with astonishingvigor, " 'were not defined, beyond the pittance of twenty-
two shillings and six per week. The rest was left contingent on the value of
my professional exertions ; in other and more expressive words, on the base-
ness of my nature, the cupidity of my motives, the poverty of my family,
the general moral (or rather immoral) resemblance between myself and-
HEEP. Need I say, that it soon became necessary for me to solicit from-
HEEP-pecuniary advances towards the support of Mrs. Micawber, and
our blighted but rising family! Need I say that this necessity bad been
foreseen by-IIEEP ? That those advances were secured by I 0 U's arid
other similar acknowledgments, known to the legal institutions of this
country. And that I t h ~ became
                               ~s      immeshed in the web he had spun for
my reception ? ' "
    Mr. Micawber's enjoyment of his epistolary powers, in describing this
unfortunate state of things, really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety
that the reality could have caused him. He read on :
    " 'Then it was that-HEEP-began       to favor me with just so much of his
confidence, as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business. Then
it was that I began, if I may so Shakespearianly express myself, to dwindle,
peak, and pine. I found that my services were constantly called into
requisition for the falsification of business, and the mystification of an
individual whom I will designate as Mr. W. That lJ1r.W. was imposed upon,
kept in ignorance, and deluded, in every possible way ; yet, that all this while,
the ruffian-HEEP-was       professing unbounded gratitude to, and unbounded
friendship for, that much abused gentleman. This was bad enoagh ; bnt, as
the philosophic Dane observes, with that universal applicability which dis-
 tinguishes the illustrious ornament of the Elizabethian Era, worse remains
 behind ! ' "
                          OF DAVID COPPEFLEIELD.

   Mr. Micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off
with a quotation, that he indulged himself, and us, with a second reading
of the sentence, under pretence of having lost his place.
   " ' I t is not my intention,' " he continued, reading on, " 'to enter on a
detailed list, within the compass of the present epistle (though it is ready
elsewhere), of the various malpractices of a minor nature, affecting the in-
dividual whom I have denominated Mr. W., to which I have been a tacitly
consenting party. My object, when the contest within myself between
stipend and no stipend, baker and no baker, existence and non-existence,
ceased, was to take advantage of my opportunities to discover and expose
the major malpractices committed, to that gentleman's grievous wrong
and injury, by-HEEP. Stimulated by the silent monitor within, and by a
no less touching and appealing inonitor without-to whom I will briefly
refer as Miss W.-I            entered on a not unlaborious task of clandestine
investigation, protracted now, to the best of my knowledge, information,
and belief, over a period exceeding twelve calendar months.' "
   He read this passage, as if it were from an Act of Parliament ; and
appeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words.
   '"My charges against-HEEP,' " he read on, glancing at him, and
drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his left arm, in case of
need, " ' are as follows.' "
   We all held our breath, I think. I am sure Uriah held his.
   " ' First,' " said Mr. Micawber. " ' When Mr. W.'s faculties and memory
for business became, through causes into which it is not necessary or
expedient for me to enter, weakened and confused,-HEEP-designedly
perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions. When
Mr. W. was least fit to enter on business,-HEEP-was               always at hand to
force him to enter on it. IIe obtained Mr. W.'s signature under such cir-
cumstances to documents of importance, representing them to be other
documents of no importance. He induced Mr. W. to empower him to draw
out, thus, one particular sum of trust-money, amounting to twelve six
fourteen, two, and nine, and employed it to nieet pretended business charges
and deficiencies which were either already provided for, or had never really
existed. He gave this proceeding, thronghout, the appearance of having
originated in Mr. W.'s own dishonest intention, and of having been aeeom-
plished by Mr. W.'s own dishonest act; and has used it, ever since, to
torture and constrain him.' "
   " You shall prove this, you Copperfield ! " said Uriah, with a threatening

shake of the head. " All in good time !"
   " A s k - - H ~ ~ ~ - h f r . Traddles, who lived in his house after him," said
Mr. Micawber, breaking off from the letter ; " will you ? "
   " The fool himself-and           lives there now," said Uriah, disdainfully.
   " Ask-H~~p-if he ever kept a pocket-book in that house," said Mr.
Micawber ; " will you ? "
   I saw Uriah's lank hand stop, involuntarily, in the scraping of his chin.
   " Or ask him,"        said Mr. Micawber, "if he ever burnt one there. If
he says yes, and asks you where the ashes are, refer him to Willtins
Micawber, and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage ! "
   The triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself of
these words, had a powerful effect in alarming the mother ; who cried out,
in much agitation :
534           THE PERSONAL I-IISTORY AND EXPERIEXCE

  " Ury, Ury ! Be umble, and make terms, my dear ! "
  " Mother ! " he retorted, " will you keep quiet ? You 're in a fright, and
don't know what you say or mean. Umble ! " he repeated, looking at me,
 with a snarl; "I've umbled some of 'em for a pretty long time back,
 umble as I was ! "
     Mr. Micawber, genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat, presently
 proceeded with his composition.
     "'Second. HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of my know-
 ledge, information, and belief' "-
     "But that won't do," muttered Uriah, relieved. " Mother, you keep
 quiet ."
     "We will endeavour to provide something that WILL do, and do for
 you finally, sir, very shortly," replied Mr. Micawber.
     " ' Second. HEEPhas, on several occasions, to the best of my knowledge,

 information, and belief, systematically forged, to various entries, books,
 and documents, the signature of Mr. W. ; and has distinctly done so in
 one instance, capable of proof by me. To wit, in manner following, that
 is to say : ' "
    Again, Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words,
 which, however ludicrously displayed in his case, was, I must say, not at
 all peculiar to him. I have observed it, in the course of my life, in num-
 bers of men. I t seems to me to be a general rule. I n the taking of legal
 oaths, for instance, deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when
 they come to several good words in succession, for the expression of one
idea; as, that they utterly detest, abominate, and abjure, or so forth ; and
 the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle. We talk
 about the tyranny of words, but we like to tyrannise over them too; we
 are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait
 upon us on great occasions; we think it looks important, and sounds
 well. As we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state
 occasions, if they be but fine and numerous enough, so, the meaning or
necessity of our words is a secondary consideration, if there be but a great
parade of them. And as individuals get into trouble by making too great
a show of liveries, or as slaves when they are too numerous rise against
their masters, so I think I could mention a nation that has got into many
great difficulties, and will get into many greater, from maintaining too
large a retinue of words.
    Mr. Micawber read on, almost smacking his lips :
    " 'To wit, in manner following, that is to say. Mr. W. being infirm,
and it being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead
to some discoveries, and to the downfall of-HEEP's-power         over the W.
family,-as I, Wilkins Micawber, the undersigned, assume-unless the
filial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from allowing
any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made, the said
-HEEP-deemed           it expedient to have a bond ready by him, as from
Mr. W., for the before-mentioned sum of twelve six fourteen, two and
nine, with interest, stated therein to have been advanced by-HEEP-to
Mr. W. to save Mr. W. from dishonor ; though really the sum was never
 advanced by him, and has long been replaced. The signatures to this
instrument, purporting to be executed by Mr. W. and attested by Wilkins
 Micarvber, are forgeries by-HEEP.         I have, in my possession, in his

hand and pocket-book, several similar imitations of Mr. W.'s signature,
here and there defaced by fire, but legible to any one. I never attested
any such document. And I have the document itself, in my possession.' "
   Uriah Heep, with a start, took out of his pocket a bunch of keys, and
 opened a certain drawer; then, suddenly bethought himself of what he
 was about, and turned again towards us, without looking in it.
   '' 'And I have the document,' " Mr. Micawber read again, looking
about as if it were the text of a sermon, " 'in my possession,'-that is to
say, I had, early this morning, when this was written, but have since
relinquished it to Mr. Traddles."
   " I t is quite true," assented Traddles.
   " Ury, Ury !" cried the mother, "be umble and make terms. I know
my son will be umble, gentlemen, if you 'l1 give him time to think. Mr.
 Copperfield, I ' m sure you know that he was always very umble, sir !"
   I t was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick, when
the son had abandoned it as useless.
    " Mother," he said, with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which
his hand was wrapped, "you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me."
    "But I love you, Ury," cried Mrs. Heep. And I have no doubt she
 did ; or that he loved her, however strange it may appear ; though, to be
 sure, they were a congenial couple. "And I can't bear to hear you
 provoking the gentlemen, and endangering of yourself more. I told the
 gentleman at first, when he told me up-stairs it was come to light, that
 I would answer for your being uinble, and making amends. Oh, see how
 umble I am, gentlemen, and don't mind him ! "
    "Why, there 'S Copperfield, mother," he angrily retorted, pointing his
lean finger at me, against whom all his animosity was levelled, as the
prime mover in the discovery ; and I did not undeceive him ; " there 'S
Copperfield, would have given you a hundred pound to say less than you've
blurted out ! "
   "I can't help it, Ury," cried his mother. "I can't see you running
into danger, through carrying your head so high. Better be umble, as
you always was."
   He remained for a little, biting the handkerchief, and then said to me
with a scowl :
   "What more have you got to bring forward? If anything, go on with
it. What do you look at me for? "
   Mr. Micawber promptly resumed his letter, only too glad to revert to a
performance with which he was so highly satisfied.
   " ' Third.   And last. I am now in a condition to show, by-HEEP'S-
false books, and-HEEP's-real        memoranda, beginning with the partially
destroyed pocket-book (which I was unable to comprehend, at the time of
its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber, on our taking possession of our
present abode, in the locker or binn devoted to the reception of the ashes
calcined on our domestic hearth), that the weaknesses, the faults, the very
virtues, the parental affections, and the sense of honor, of the unhappy Mr.
W. have been for years acted on by, and warped to the base purposes of-
HEEP. That Mr. W. has been for years deluded and plundered, in every
conceivable manner, to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious,
false, and grasping-HEEP. That the engrossing object of-HEEP-was,
next to gain, to subdue Mr. and Miss W. (of his ulterior views in reference
 536           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 to the latter I say nothing) entirely to himself. That his last act, com-
 pleted but a few months since, was to induce Mr. W. to execute a relin-
 quishment of his share in the partnership, and even a bill of sale on the
 very furniture of his house, in consideration of a certain annuity, to be
 well and truly paid ~Y-HEEP-O~ the four common quarter-days in each
 and every year. That these meshes; beginning with alarming and falsified
 accounts of the estate of which Mr. W. is the receiver, at a period when
 Mr. W. had launched into imprudent and ill-judged speculations, and
 may not have had the money, for which he was morally and legally
 responsible, in hand; going on with pretended borrowings of money at
 enormous interest, really coming from-HEEP-and        by-H~~~-fraudn-
 lently obtained or withheld from Mr. W. himself, on pretence of such
 speculations or otherwise ; perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of
 unscrupulous chicaneries-gradually thickened, until the unhappy Mr. W.
 could see no world beyond. Bankrupt, as he believed, alike in circum-
 stances, in all other hope, and in honor, his sole reliance was upon the
 monster in the garb of man,' "--Mr. Micawber made a good deal of this,
 as a new turn of expression,-" 'who, by making himself necessary to
 him, had achieved his destruction. All this I undertake to show.
Probably much more !' "
    I whispered a few words to Agnes, who was weeping, half joyfully,
half-sorrowfully, at my side; and there was a movement among ns, as if
Nr. Micawber had finished. He said, with exceeding gravity, "Pardon
me," and proceeded, with a mixture of the lowest spirits and the most
intense eiijoyment, to the peroration of his letter.
    " ' I have now concluded.    It, merely remains for me to substantiate
these accusations ; and then, with my ill-starred family, to disappear from
the landscape on which we appear to be an incnmbrance. That is soon
done. It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of
inanition, as being the frailest member of our circle; and that our twins
will follow next in order. So be it ! For myself, my Canterbury Pil-
grimage has done much; imprisonment on civil process, and want, will
soon do more. I trust that the labor and hazard of an investigation-of
which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure
of arduous avocations, nnder grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of
morii, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one
whom it were superfluous to call Demon-combined with the struggle
of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may
be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funereal pyre.
I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant
and eminent naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that
what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objects,
                      For England, home, and Beauty.
  " ' Remaining always, &c. &C., WILICIY~&~ICATVBICR.'"
  Much affected, but still intensely enjoying himself, Mr. Xicawber folded
up his letter, and handed it with a bow to my aunt, as something she
might like to keep.
  There was, as I had noticed on my first visit long ago, an iron safe in
the room. The key was in it. A hasiy suspicion seemed to strike Uiiah ;
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

and, with a glance at Mr. Micawber, he went to it, and threw the doors
clanking open. I t was empty.
    "Where are the books ! " he cried, with a frightful face. " Some thief
has stolen the books ! "
    Mr. Micawber tapped himself with the ruler. " I did, when I got the
key from you as usual-but a little earlier-and opened it this morning."
    "Don't be uneasy," said Traddles. " They have come into my pos-
session. I will take care of them, under the authority I mentioned."
    " You receive stolen goods, do you? " cried Uriah.
    " Under such circumstances," answered Traddles, "yes."
    What was my astonishment when I beheld my aunt, who had been
profoundly quiet and attentive, make a dart at Uriah Heep, and seize him
by the collar with both hands !
    " You know what I want? " said my aunt.

    " A strait-waistcoat," said he.
      No. My property ! " returned my aunt. " Agnes, my dear, as long
as Ibelievedit had been really made away with by your father, I .wouldn't
-and, my dear, I didn't, even to Trot, as he knows-breathe a syllable
 of its having beenplaced here for investment. But, now I know this fellow's
 answerable for it, and I'll have it ! Trot, come and take it away from him !"
    Whether my aunt supposed, for the moment, that he kept her property
 in his neck-kerchief, I am sure I don't know ; but she certainly pulled at
 it as if she thought so. I hastened to put mjrself between them, and to
 assure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost
restitution of everything he had wrongly got. This, and a few moments'
reflection, pacified her; but she was not at all disconcerted by what she
had done (though I cannot say as much for her bonnet) and resumed her
seat composedly.
    During the last few minutes, Mrs. Ileep had been clamoring to her
son to be " umble; " and had been going down on her knees to all of us
in snccession, and making the wildest promises. Her son sat her down in
his chair; and, standing sulkily by her, holding her arm with his hand,
but not rudely, said to me, with a ferocious look:
    " What do you want done ? "

    " I will tell you what must be done," said Traddles.

    " Has that Copperfield no tongue ? " muttered Uriah.        " I would do a
good deal for you if you could tell me, without lying, that somebody had
cut it out."
    "My Uriah means to be umble ! " cried his mother. " Don't mind
what he says, good gentlemen ! "
    "What must be done," said Traddles, "is this. First, the deed of relin-
quishment, that we have heard of, must be given over to me now-here."
    " Suppose I haven't got it," he interrupted.

    "But you have," said Traddles ; "therefore, you know, we won't sup-
pose so." And I cannot help avowing that this was the first occasion on
which I really did justice to the clear head, and the plain, patient, prac-
tical good sense, of my old schoolfellow. " Then," said Traddles, " you
must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of,
and to make restoration to the last farthing. All the partnership books
and papers must remain in our possession ; all your boolts and papers ; all
money accounts and securities, of both kinds. I n short, everything here."
538           THE PZRSONAL HISTORY AND EXPEXIENCE

     " Must it ? I don't know that," said Uriah. "I must have time to
  think about that."
     " Certainly," replied Traddles ; "but, in the meanwhile, and until
  everything is done to our satisfaction, we shall maintain possession of
  these things; and beg you-in short, compel you-to keep your own
 room, and hold no communication with any one."
     " I won't do it ! " said Uriah, with an oath.
     " Maidstone Jail is a safe' place of detention," observed Traddles ;
  "and though the law may be longer in righting us, and may not be able
 to right us so completely as you can, there is no doubt of its punishing
 you. Dear me, you know that quite as well as I! Copperfield, will you
 go round to the Guildhall, and bring a couple of officers?"
    Here, hfrs. Heep broke out again, crying on her knees to Agnes to in-
 terfere in their behalf, exclaiming that he was very humble, and it was all
 true, and if he didn't do what we wanted, she would, and much more to the
 same purpose ; being half frantic with fears for her darling. To inquire
 what he might have done, if he had had any boldness, would be like
 inquiring what a mongrel cur might do, if it had the spirit of a tiger. H e
was a corvard, from head to foot ;and showed his dastardly nature through
his sullenness and mortification, as much as at any time of his mean life.
    " Stop ! " he growled to me ; and wiped his hot face with his hand.
 "Mother, hold your noise. Well! Let'em have that deed. Go and fetch it ! "
    "Do you help her, Mr. Dick," said Traddles, "if you please."
    Proud of his commission, and understanding it, Mr. Dick accompanied
her as a shepherd's dog might accompany a sheep. But, Mrs. Ileep gave
him little trouble; for she not only returned with the deed, but with the
box in which it was, where we found a banker's book and some other
papers that were afterwards serviceable.
    " Good ! " said Traddles, when this was brought.      " Now, Mr. Heep,
you can retire to think : particularly observing, if you please, that I de-
clare to you, on the part of all present, that there is only one thing to be
done ; that it is what I have explained; and that it must be done without
delay."
    Uriah, without lifting his eyes from the ground, shuflled across the
room with his hand to his chin, and pausing at the door, said :
    " Copperfield, I have always hated you.        You've always been an
upstart, and you've always been against me."
    " As I think I told you once beforeJJ'saidI, "it is you who have been,

in your greed and cunning, against all the world. I t may be profitable
to you to reflect, in future, that there never were greed and cunning in the
world yet, that did not do too much, and over-reach themselves. I t is as
certain as death."
    " Or as certain as they used to teach at school (the same school where
I picked up so much umbleness), from nine o'clock to eleven, that labor
was a curse; and from eleven o'clock to one, that it was a blessing and a
cheerfulness, and a dignity, and I don't know what all, eh? " said he with a
sneer. " You preach, about as consistent as they did. Won't umbleness
go down? I shouldn't have got round my gentleman fellow-partner with-
 out it, I think.-Micawber, you old bully, I'll pay you !"
    Mr. Micawber, supremely defiant of him and his extended finger, arid
 making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door,

then addressed himself to me, and proffered me the satisfaction of wit-
nessing the re-establishment of mutual confidence between himself and
Mrs. Micawber." After which, he invited the company generally to the
contemplation of that affecting spectacle.
    "The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber and
myself, is now withdrawn," said Mr. Micawber; "and my children and
the Author of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms."
    As we were all very grateful to him, and all desirous to show that we
were, as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit, I dare
say we should all have gone, but that it was necessary for Agnes to return
to her father, as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope; and
for some one else to hold Uriah in safe keeping. So, Traddles remained
for the latter purpose, to be presently relieved by Mr. Dick ; and Mr. Dick,
my aunt, and I, went home with Mr. Micawber. As I parted hurriedly
from the dear girl to whom I owed so much, and thought from what she
had been saved, perhaps, that morning-her better resolution notwith-
standing-I felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger days
which had brought me to the knowledge of Mr. Micawber.
    His house was not far off; and as the street-door opened into the
 sitting room, and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own, we
 found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family. Mr. Micawber ex-
 claiming, " Emma ! my life ! " rushed into Mrs. Micawber's arms. Mrs.
 Micawber shrieked, and folded Mr. Micawber in her embrace. Miss
 Micawber, nursing the unconscious stranger of Mrs. Micawber's last
 letter to me, was sensibly affected. The stranger leaped. The twins
testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations.
Master Micawber, whose disposition appeared to have been soured by
early disappointment, and whose aspect had become morose, yielded to his
better feelings, and blubbered.
    " Emma ! " said Mr. Micawber.        " The cloud is past from my mind.
Mutual confidence, so long preserved between us once, is restored, to know
no farther interruption. Now, welcome poverty ! " cried Mr. Micawber,
shedding tears. "Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome
hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary ! Mutual confidence will sustain us
to the end ! "
    With these expressions, Mr. Micawber placed Mrs. Micawber in a chair,
and embraced the family all round; welcoming a variety of bleak pros-
pects, which appeared, to the best of my judgment, to be anything but
welcome to them; and calling upon them to come out into Canterbury and
sing a chorus, as nothing else was left for their support.
    But Mrs. Micawber having, in the strength of her emotions, fainted
away, the first thing to be done, even before the chorus could be consi-
dered complete, was to recover her. This, my aunt and Mr. Micawber did;
and then my aunt was introduced, and Mrs. Micawber recognised me.
    " Excuse me, dear Mr. Copperfield," said the poor lady, giving me her

hand, " but I am not strong ; and the removal of the late misunderstand-
ing between Mr. Micawber and myself was at first too much for me."
    " Is this all your family, ma'am? " said my aunt.
    "There are no more at present," returned Mrs. Micawber.
    " Good gracious, I didn't mean that, ma'am," said my aunt.     " I mean
are all these yours? "
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    " Madam," replied Mr. Micawber, " it is a true bill."
   "And that eldest young gentleman, now," said my aunt, musing.
"  What has he been brought up to ? "
   " I t was my hope when I came here," said Mr. Micawber, "to have
got Wilkins into the Church: or perhaps I shall express my meaning
more strictly, if I say the Choir. But there was no vacancy for a tenor in
the venerable Pile for which this city is so justly eminent; and he has-
in short, he has contracted a habit of singing in public-houses, rather than
in sacred edifices."
   "But he means well," said Mrs. Micawber, tenderly.
   "I dare say, my love," rejoined Mr. Micawber, "that he means par-
ticularly well ; but I have not yet found that he carries out his meaning,
in any given direction whatsoever."
   Master Micawber's moroseness of aspect returned upon him again, and
he demanded, with some temper, what he was to do? Whether he had
been born a carpenter, or a coach painter, any more than he had been
born a bird? Whether he could go into the next street, and open a
chemist's shop ? Whether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim
himself a lawyer? Whether he could come out by force at the opera, and
succeed by violence? Whether he could do anything, without being brought
up to something?
   My aunt mused a little while, and then said :
   "Mr. Micawber, I wonder you have never tamed your thoughts to
emigration."
   " Madam," returned Mr. Micawber, " it was the dream of my youth,
and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years." I am thoroughly per-
suaded, by the bye, that he had never thought of it in his life.
   "Aye ? " said my aunt, with a glance at me. " Why, what a thing
it would be for yourselves and your family, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, if you
were to emigrate now."
   " Capital, madam, capital," urged Mr. Micawber, gloomily.

   " That is the principal, I may say the only difficulty, my dear Mr.
Copperfield," assented his wife.
   " Capital? " cried my aunt.     "But you are doing us a great service-
have done us a great service, I may say, for surely much will come out
of the fire-and what could we do for you, that would be half so good as
to find the capital ? "
   "I could not receive it as a gift," said Mr. Micawber, full of fire and
animation, "but if a sufficient sum could be advanced, say at five per cent.
interest, per annum, upon my personal liability-say my notes of hand,
at twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months, respectively, to allow time
for something to turn up ---"
   " Could be ? Can be, and shall be, on your own terms," returned my
aunt, " if you say the word. Think of this now, both of you. Here are
some people David knows, going out to Australia shortly. If you decide
to go, why shouldn't you go in the same ship? You may help each
other. Think of this now, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. Take your time,
and weigh it well."
   "There is but one cjuestion, my dear ma'aln, I could wish to ask,"
said Mrs. Micawber. "The climate, I believe, is healthy."
   '' Finest in the world ! " said my aunt.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   " Just  SO," returned Mrs. Micawber. "Then my question arises.
Now, are the circumstances of the country such, that a man of Mr.
Micawber's abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale?
I will not say, at present, might he aspire to be Governor, or anything of
that sort; but would there be a reasonable opening for his talents to
develop themselves-that, would be amply sufficient-and find their own
expansion ? "
   " No better opening anywhere," said my aunt, "for a man who conducts

himself well, and is industrious."
   "For a man who conducts himself well," repeated Mrs. Xcawber, with
her clearest business manner, "and is industrious. Precisely. I t is evident
to me that Australia is the legitimate sphere of action for Mr. Micawber ! "
   " I entertain the conviction, my dear madam," said Mr. Micawber,
"that it is, under existing circumstances, the land, the only land, for
myself and family; and that something of an extraordinary nature will
turn up on that shore. I t is no distance-comparatively speaking; and
though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal, I assure
you that is a mere matter of form."
   Shall I ever forget how, in a moment, he was the most sanguine of
men, looking on to fortune ; or how Mrs. Micawber presently discoursed
about the habits of the kangaroo! Shall I ever recall that street of
Canterbury on a market day, without recalling him, as he walked back
with us; expressing, in the hardy roving manner he assumed, the un-
settled habits of a temporary sojonrner in the land; and looking at the
bullocks, as they came by, with the eye of an Australian farmer !


                            CHAPTER LIII.
                          ANOTHER RETROSPECT.
  I ncus~pause yet once again. 0, my child-wife, there is a figure in
the moving crowd before my memory, quiet and still, saying in its innocent
love and childish beauty, Stop to think of me-turn to look upon the little
blossom, as it flutters to the ground !
   I do. All else grows dim, and fades away. I am again with Dora, in our
cottage. I do not know how long she has been ill. I am so used to it
in feeling, that I cannot count the time. I t is not really long, in weeks or
months ; but, in my usage and experience, it is a weary, weary while.
   They have left off tell~ngme to "wait a few days more." I have begun
to fear, remotely, that the day may never shine, when I shall see my child-
wife running in the sunlight with her old friend Jip.
   H e is, as it were suddenly, grown very old. I t may be, that he misses
in his mistress, something that enlivened him and made him younger; but
he mopes, and his sight is weak, and his limbs are feeble, and my aunt is
sorry that he objects to her no more, but creeps near her as he lies on
Dora's bed-she sitting at the bedside-and mildly licks her hand.
   Dora lies smiling on us, and is beautiful, and utters no hasty or com-
plaining word. She says that we are very good to her; that her dear old
careful boy is tiring himself out, she knows; that my aunt has no sleep,
yet is always wakeful, active, and kind. Sometimes, the little bird-like
               THE PERSONAL IIISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

ladies come to see her; and then we talk about our wedding-day, and all
that happy time.
   What a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be-and in
all life, within doors and without-when I sit in the quiet, shaded, orderly,
room, with the blue eyes of my child-wife turned towards me, and her little
fingers twining round my hand ! Many and many an hour I sit thus ; but,
of all those times, three times come the freshest on my mind.
   I t is morning ; and Dora, made so trim by my aunt's hands, shews me
how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet, and how long and bright
it is, and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears.
   "Not that I am vain of it, now, you mocking boy," she says, when I
smile; "but because you used to say you thought it so beautiful; and
because, when I first began to think about you, I used to peep in the
glass, and wonder whether you would like very much to have a lock of it.
Oh what a foolish fellow you were, Doady, when I gave you one ! "
   " That was on the day when you were painting the flowers I had given
you, Dora, and when I told you how much in love I was."
   " Ah ! but I didn't like to tell you," says Dora, " then, how I had
cried over them, because I believed you really liked me ! When I can
run about again as I used to do, Doady, let us go and see those places
where we were such a silly couple, shall we ? And take some of the old
walks ? And not forget poor papa ? "
   " Yes, we will, and have some happy days. So you must make haste
to get well, my dear."
   " Oh, I shall soon do that ! I am so much better, you don't know ! "


   I t is evening; and I sit in the same chair, by the same bed, with the
 same face turned towards me. We have been silent, and there is a smile
upon her face. I have ceased to carry my light burden up and down
stairs now. She lies here all the day.
   " Doady ! "

   '' My dear Dora ! "
   "You won't think what I am going to say, unreasonable, after what
you told me, such a little while ago, of Mr. Wickfield's not being well? I
want to see Agnes. Very much I want to see her."
   " I will write to her, my dear."
   " Will you ? '"
   " Directly."
   "What a good, kind boy ! Doady, take me on your arm. Indeed, my
dear, it 'S not a whim. I t 'S not a foolish fancy. I want, very much
indeed, to see her ! "
   " I am certain of it. I have only to tell her so, and she is sure to come."
   "You are very lonely when you go down stairs, now?" Dora whispers,
with her arm about my neck.
   " How can I be otherwise, my own love, when I see your empty chair? "

   " My empty chair ! "    She clings to me for a little while, in silence.
" And you really miss me, Doady ? " looking up, and brightly smiling.

" Even poor, giddy, stupid me ? "

   "My heart, who is there upon earth that I could miss so much?"
   " Oh, husband ! I am so glad, yet so sorry ! " creeping closer to me,
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            543
and folding me in both her arms. She laughs, and sobs, and then is quiet,
and quite happy.
    " Quite! " she says.    " Only give Agnes my dear love, and tell her
that I want very, very, much to see her ; and I have nothing left to wish for."
    " Except to get well again, Dora."

    "Ah, Doady ! Sometimes I think-you know I always was a silly
little thing !-that that will never be ! "
    " Don't say so, Dora ! Dearest love, don't think so ! "
    " I won't, if I can help it, Doady.   But I am very happy ; though my
dear boy is so lonely by himself, before his child-wife's empty chair ! "

   I t is night; and I am with her still. Agnes has arrived; has been
among us, for a whole day and an evening. She, my aunt, and I, have
sat with Dora since the morning, all together. We have not talked much,
but Dora has been perfectly contented and cheerful. We are now alone.
   Do I know, now, that my child-wife will soon leave me? They have
told me so ; they have told me nothing new to my thoughts ; but I am
far from sure that I have taken that truth to heart. I cannot master it.
I have withdrawn by myself, many times to-day, to weep. I have re-
membered Who wept for a parting between the living and the dead. I
have bethought me of all that gracious and compassionate history. I
have tried to resign myself, and to console myself; and that, I hope, I may
have done imperfectly; but what I cannot firmly settle in my mind is,
that the end will absolutely come. I hold her hand in mine, I hold her
heart in mine, I see her love for me, alive in all its strength. I cannot
shut out a pale lingering shadow of belief that she will be spared.
   " I am going to speak to you, Doady.     I am going to say something
I have often thought of saying, lately. You won't mind ? " with a gentle
look.
   " Mind, my darling? "
   "Because I don't know what you will think, or what you may have
thought sometimes. Perhaps you have often thought the same. Doady,
 dear, I am afraid I was too young."
    I lay my face upon the pillow by her, and she looks into my eyes, and
 speaks very softly. Gradually, as she goes on, I feel, with a stricken heart,
that she is speaking of herself as past.
    " I am afraid, dear, I was too young. I don't mean in years only, but
in experience, and thoughts, and everything. I was such a silly little
 creature ! I am afraid it would have been better, if we had only loved
 each other as a boy and girl, and forgotten it. I have begun to think I
 was not fit to be a wife."
    I try to stay my tears, and to reply, " Oh, Dora, love, as fit as I to be
a husband ! "
    " I don't know," with the old shake of her curls. " Perhaps ! But, if
I had been more fit to be married, I might have made you more so, too.
Besides, you are very clever, and I never was."
    " W e have been very happy, my sweet Dora."
    " I was very happy, very. But, as years went on, my dear boy would
have wearied of his child-wife. She would have been less and less a com-
panion for him. He would have been more and more sensible of what was
wanting in his home. She wouldn't have improved. I t is better as it is."
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    "Oh, Dora, dearest, dearest, do not speak to me so. Every word seems
a reproach ! "
    "No, not a syllable ! " she answers, kissing me. " Oh, my dear, you
never deserved it, and I loved you far too well, to say a reproachful word to
you, in earnest-it was all the merit I had, except being pretty-or you
thought me so. I s it lonely down-stairs, Doady ? "
    " Very ! Very ! "

    " Don't cry ! I s my chair there? "
   " I n its old place."

   "' h,   how my poor boy cries ! Hush, hush ! Now, make me one
promise. I want to speak to Agnes. When you go down-stairs, tell
Agnes so, and send her up to me; and while I speak to her, let no one
come-not even aunt. I want to speak to Agnes by herself. I want to
speak to Agnes, quite alone."
    I promise that she shall, immediately ; but I cannot leave her, for my
grief.
    " I said that it was better as it is ! " she whispers, as she holds me in

her arms. " Oh, Doady, after more years, you never could have loved your
child-wife better than you do ; and, after more years, she would so have tried
and disappointed you, that you might not have been able to love her half
so well ! I know I was too young and foolish. I t is much better as it is ! "

   Agnes is down-stairs, when I go into the parlor; and I give her the
message. She disappears, leaving me alone with Jip.
   His Chinese house is by the fire; and he lies within it, on his bed of
flannel, querulously trying to sleep. The bright moon is high and clear.
As I look out on the night, my tears fall fast, and my undisciplined heart
is chastened heavily-heavily.
   I sit down by the fire, thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret
feelings I have nourished since my marriage. I think of every little trifle
between me and llora, and feel the truth, that trifles make the sum of life.
Ever rising from the sea of my remembrance, is the image of the dear child
as I knew her first, graced by my young love, and by her own, with every
fascination wherein such love is rich. Would it, indeed, have been better
if we had loved each other as a boy and girl, and forgotten i t ? Undis-
ciplined heart, reply !
   How the time wears, I know not ; until I am recalled by my child-wife's
old companion. More restless than he was, he crawls out of his house,
and looks at me, and wanders to the door, and whines to go up-stairs.
   "Not to-night, Jip ! Not to-night ! "
   He comes very slowly back to me, licks my hand, and lifts his dim eyes
to my face.
   " 0, Jip ! I t may be, never again ! "
   He lies down at my feet, stretches himself out as if to sleep, and with
a plaintive cry, is dead.
   " 0 Agnes ! Look, look, here ! "

   -That face, so full of pity and of grief, that rain of tears, that awful
mute appeal to me, that solemn hand upraised towards Heaven!
    " Agnes ? "
    I t is over. Darkness comes before my eyes ; and, for a time, all things
 are blotted out of my remembrance.

        EVERY PERSON MAY BECOME HIS O W N PRINTER,

   The Process is extremely simple, and thousands of copies may be
produced from any writing, drawing, piece of music, or design
(previously made on paper), and the requisite number of copies
being finished the subject may be effaced and another substituted.
   This Invention will be found of great utility to Railway Companies,
in corresponding with their Stations ; to Joint Stock Banks, for
producing copies of Letters to Branches; to Merchants, for PTice
 Currents and Statements; to all persons engaged in Business, for
printing their own Circulars, Invoices, Statements, 4c. ; to Teachers,
for multiplying copies of lessons; and to Private Individuals it will
be found useful and amusing, in privately producing copies of their
own composition in poetry, prose, music, or drawing.
   The attention of the Exporter and Emigrant is particularly called
to the importance of this invention, for the Colonies and Foreign
Countries, when it is considered that in many places no printer is to
be found, and that in some countries, especially in the East, the com-
plication of the numerous Oriental characters renders i t necessary for
all documents to be multiplied by the tedious process of transcribing.
   The Press is manufactured in three sizes, and the whole apparatus
is contained in neat boxes, French-polished. The Patentees, feeling
 convinced of the great utility of this invention, and anticipating a
large sale, have determined upon offering them a t the following low

  I mention thii by way of introduction                     You would not meet with quite so much respect
  To sometbing for amusement and instruction.               But for the plumes in whlch you now are deck'd.
  A sweet young lady, of the name of Nancy,                 'Tis dress, my pretty bird, you'll bear in mind
  Kept a fine peacock by the way of fancy:                  Does just the same with you as with mankind:"
  Who, thus, one day (positively begging pardon,)
  Address'd his fair young mistress in her garden :-                            APPLICATION.
  " I 'Ve very often, Madam, wish'd t o know                Learn, gentle reader, from this simple fable,
  What is the reason that vou nrize me so.                  To dress yourself as well as you are able;
  I cannot crow, nor can ~ . e v e i - c ~ u e k~--         Nor fail to go to MOSES'noted mart
  Nor quack nor gabble, like a goose Ar dnck-               For articles of clothing good and d a r t .
  My hoarse wild scream is such a s some would hush,        MOSESand SONcan deck you in attire
  Persons might almost think I had the thrush.              Whose quality and beauty all admire.
  I've got a tidy 'rigging-out,' I know,                    Yes-you will win, in dress, by M. and SON
  But, la, dear me! that 'S only outward show."             More admiration than you ever won.

 LIVERPOOL,                     Sgptember, 1850.
 I n September, 1840-We        Opened a department ,for the
          supplying of Families with Tea and Co$ee-zipon      a
          principle ccclculated to aford the greatest advantage
          i n Price-with every security as to Quality.
 TVHEN Q U A L I T Y is thus made the primary consideration
       -and      Price is fixed upon strictly economical
       principles-we were confident that our interest-as
       involved in the question of Profit-would    be fully
       secured by an increasing demand, which has been,
       and must be, the result of such a system-so
       obviously based.
 TITE CON,STAATT care and exact judgement exercised i n
        our method of selection and classification of
        qualities-have  been appreciated, ancl proved by
        the continually increasing extent of tlle FAMILY
        TRIDE-in coni~ectionwith our Establishment.
WE C A N N O T refrain from directing the attention of
      Family Purchasers, to the present anomalous state
      of the--TEA MARKET-viz.
THE FIRST COST OF good and choice kinds is,-at         present,--unusually
    reasonable, a t the same time, there is an increasing demand for the
    commonest BLACK    TEA. This indicates that-CHEAPNESS-being        more
    regarded by inany Dealers than QUALITY-Disappointment            is the
    necessary consequence, to FAIT~ILIE;Swhose supplies are derived from
    parties not possessing the requisite advantages in SELECTION and
    PURCI-IASE.

deterioration of this covering of the head impairs good looks to such a degree that artificial locks
a r e obliged to be resorted to to give the proper effect to beautiful features, which, without such
aid, would be deprived of half their charm. Who will not say that the appearance of a man, also,
is greatly improved by a fine head of hair ?

  The ancients highly esteemed a fine head of hair. And we learn from Juvenal and Horace,
that, among the Romans, n o t h i ~ ~was
                                     g deemed more essential to the beauty of a young person,

 Numerous complaints have been received from invalids of their health having been fearfully impaired by spurious
 compounds of pease, beans, Indian and oat-meal, palmed off upon them under closely similar names, such as
 Ervalenta, Arabian Revalenta, Lentil powder, &C., Messns. Du BARRYhave taken the trouble of analysing all
 these compounds, and find them to be h,zrmless as food to the healthy, but utterly devoid of all curative principles,
 a n d being of a flatulent and irritating tendency, they are no better adapted to cure disease, than oil to quenching a
 conflagration. Nor can these imitative impostors show a single cure, whilst Du BARRY'SREVALENTA                          ARABICAhas
received the most flattering testimonials from 50,000 persons of high respectability; nor is it a n exaggeration to
ascribe to this extraordinary curative FOOD          ;a share in the great decrease of disease and mortality in the metropolis-
a decrease of 200 deaths per week. Sold in canisters, with full instructions, and bearing the seal and signature of Du

                           CHAPTER LIV.


   THIS is not the time at which I am to enter on the state of my mind
beneath its load of sorrow. I came to think that the Future was walled
up before me, that the energy and action of my life were at an end, that I
never could find any refuge but in the grave. I came to think so, I say,
but not in the first shock of my grief. I t slowly grew to that. If the
events I go on to relate, had not thickened around me, in the beginning to
confuse, and in the end to augment, my affliction, it is possible, (though I
think not probable), that I might have fkllen at once into this condition.
As it was, an interval occurred before I fully knew my own distress; an
interval, in which I even supposed that its sharpest pangs were past ; and
when my mind could soothe itself by resting on all that was most innocent
and beautiful, in the tender story that was closed for ever.
   When it was first proposed that I should go abroad, or how it came to
be agreed among us that I was to seek the restoration of my peace in
change and travel, I do not, even now, distinctly know. The spirit of
Agnes so pervaded all we thought, and said, and did, in that time of sorrow,
that I assume I may refer the project to her influence. But her influence
was so quiet that I know no more.
   And now, indeed, I began to think that in my old association of her
with the stained-glass window in the church, a p~opheticforeshadowing of
what she would be to me, in the calamity that was to happen in the full-
ness of time, had found a way into my mind. I n all that sorrow, from the
moment, never to be forgotten, when she stood before me with her upraised
hand, she was like a sacred presence in my lonely house. When the
Angel of Death alighted there, my child-wife fell asleep-they told me so
when I could bear to hear it-on her bosom, with a smile. From my
swoon, I first awoke to a consciousness of her compassionate tears, her
words of hope and peace, her gentle face bending down as from a
purer region nearer Heaven, over my undisciplined heart, and softening
its pain.
    et me go on.
   I was to go abroad. That seemed to have been determined among us
from the first. The ground now covering all that could perish of my
departed wife, I waited only for what Mr. Micawber called the "final
pulverisation of Heep," and for the departure of the emigrants.
   At the request of Traddles, most affectionate and devoted of friends
in my trouble, we returned to Canterbury : I mean my aunt, Agnes, and I.
We proceeded by appointment straight to Mr. Mica~vber's house ; where,
and at Mr. Wickfield's, my friend had been labouring ever since our
explosive meeting. When poor Mrs. Micawber saw me come in, in my black
clothes, she was sensibly affected. There was a great deal of good in
546           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

Mrs. Micawber's heart, which had not been dunned out of it in all those
many years.
    " Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber," was my aunt's first salutation after

we were seated. "Pray, have you thought about that emigration proposal
of mine ? "
    "My dear madam," returned Mr. Micawber, " perhaps I cannot better
express the conclusion at which Mrs. Micawber, your humble servant, and
I may add our children, have jointly and severally arrived, than by bor-
rowing the language of an illustrious poet, to reply that our Boat is on
the shore, and our Bark is on the sea."
    " That 'S right,"  said my aunt. " I augur all sorts of good from your
sensible decision."
    " Madam, you do us a great deal of honor," he rejoined. He then
referred to a memorandum. " With respect to the pecuniary assistance
enabling us to lannch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise, I have
reconsidered that important business-point ; and would beg to propose my
notes of hand-drawn, it is needless to stipulate, on stamps of the amounts
respectively required by the various Acts of Parliament applying to such
securities-at eighteen, twenty-four, and thirty months. The proposi-
tion I originally submitted, was twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four ; but
I am apprehensive that such an arrangement might not allow sufficient
time for the requisite amount of-Something-to           turn up. We might
not," said Mr. Micawber, looking round the room as if it represented
several hundred acres of highly-cultivated land, " on the first responsibility
becoming due, have been successful in our harvest, or we might not have
 got our harvest in. Labor, I believe, is sometimes difficult to obtain in
 that portion of our colonial possessions where it will be our lot to combat
 with the teeming soil."
    "Arrange it in any way you please, sir," said my aunt.
    " Madam," he replied, " Mrs. Micawber and myself are deeply sensible
 of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons. What I wish
is, to be perfectly business-like, and perfectly punctnal. Turning over, as
we are about to turn over, an entirely new leaf; and falling back, as we are
now in the act of falling back, for a Spring of no common magnitude ; it
is important to my sense of self-respect, besides being an example to my
son, that these arrangements should be concluded as between man and
man."
    I don't know that Mr. Micawber attached any meaning to this last
phrase; I don't know that anybody ever does, or did; but he appeared to
relish it uncommonly, and repeated, with an impressive cough, " as between
man and man."
    " I propose," said Mr. Micawber, " Bills-a convenience to the mer-
cantile world, for which, I believe, we are originally indebted to the
Jews, who appear to me to have had a de>ilish deal too much to do with
them ever since-because they are negotiable. But if a Bond, or any
 other description of security, would be preferred, I should be happy to
 execute any such instrument. As between man and man."
    My aunt observed, that in a case where both parties were willing to
 agree to anything, she took it for granted there would be no difficulty
 in settling this point. hlr, Nicawber was of her opinion.
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            547
     " In reference to our domestic preparations, madam," said Mr. Micaw-
 ber, with some pride, "for meeting the destiny to which we are now
 understood to be self-devoted, I beg to report them. My eldest daughter
 attends at five every morning in a neighbouring establishment, to acquire
 the process-if process it may be called-of milking cows. My younger
 children are instructed to observe, as closely as circumstances will permit,
 the habits of the pigs and poultry maintained in the poorer parts of this
 city: a pursuit from which they have, on two occasions, been brought
 home, within an inch of being run over. I have myself directed some
 attention, during the past week, to the art of baking ; and my son Wilkins
has issued forth with a walking-stick and driven cattle, when permitted, by
the rugged hirelings who had them in charge, to render any voluntary
 service in that direction-which I rrgret to say, for the credil of our
nature, was not often; he being generally warned, with imprecations, to
desist."
    " All very right indeed," said my aunt, encouragingly. " Mrs. Micawber
has been busy, too, I have no doubt."
    " My dear madam," returned Xrs. Micawber, with her business-like

air, " I am free to confess, that I have not been actively engaged in pur-
suits immediately connected with cultivation or with stock, though well
aware that both will claim my attention on a foreign shore. Such oppor-
tunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic dutles, I
have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family. For I
own it seems to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber, who
always fell back on me, I suppose from old habit, to whomsoever rlse
she might address her discourse at starting, " that the time is come when
the past should be buried in oblivion; when my family should take Mr.
Micawber by the hand, and Mr. Micawber should take my family by the
hand; when the lion should lie down with the lamb, and my family be on
terms with Mr. Micawber."
    I said I thought so too.
    "This, at least, is the light, my dear Mr. Copperfield," pursued Mrs.
Nicawber, "in which I view the subject. When I lived at home with
my papa and mama, my papa was accustomed to ask, when any point was
under discussion in our limited circle, ' I n what light does my Emma
view the subject ? ' That my papa was too partial, I know ; still, on such
a point as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between Mr. Micaw-
her and my family, I necessarily have formed an opinion, delusive though
it may be."
    " N o doubt. Of course you have, ma'am," said my aunt,
    " Precisely so," assented Mrs. Micawber.      "Now, I may bc wrong in
my conclusions ; it is very likely that I am ; but my individual impression
is, that the gulf between my family and Mr. Micawber may be trdcpd to
 an apprehension, on the part of my family, that Mr. Blicawber would
require pecuniary accommodation. I cannot hclp thinking," said Mrs.
 Micawber, with an air of deep sagacity, "that there are members of my
family who have been apprehensive that Mr. ;\llca\vber would solicit them
 for their names.-I     do not mean to be conferred in Baptism upon our
children, but to be inscribed on Bills of Exchange, and negotiated in the
Money Market."

5438          THX PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    The look of penetration with which Mrs. Micawber announced this dis-
 covery, as if no one had ever thought of it before, seemed rather to
 astonish my aunt ; who abruptly replied, " Well, ma'am, upon the whole,
 I shouldn't wonder if you were right ! "
    "Mr. Micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary
 shackles that have so long enthralled him," said Mrs. Micawber, "and of
commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for
his abilities,-which, in my opinion, is exceedingly important ; Mr. Micaw-
ber's abilities peculiarly requiring space,-it seems to me that my family
should signalise the occasion by coming forward. What I could wish to
see, would be a meeting between Mr. Micawber and my family at a
festive entertainment, to be given at my family's expence; where Mr.
Micawber's health and prosperity beingproposed, by some leading member
of my family, Mr. Micawber might have an opportunity of developing
his views."
   "My dear," said Mr. Micawber, with some heat, "it may be better for
me to state distinctly, at once, that if I were to develop my views to that
assembled group, they would possibly be found of an offensive nature:
my impression being that your family are, in the aggregate, impertinent
Snobs ; and, in detail, unmitigated Ruffians."
    " Micawber," said Mrs. Micawber, shaking her head, "no ! You have
never understood them, and they have never understood you."
   Mr. Micawber coughed.
    " They have never understood you, Micawber," said his wife.     " They
may be incapable of it. If so, that is their misfortune. I can pity their
misfortune."
    " I am extremely sorry, my dear Emma," said Mr. Micawber, relenting,
 "to have been betrayed into any expressions that might, even remotely,
 have the appearance of being strong expressions. All I would say, is,
that I can go abroad without your family coming forward to favor me,-in
short, with a parting Shove of their cold shoulders ; and that, upon the
whole, I would rather leave England with such impetus as I possess, than
derive any acceleration of it from that quarter. At the same time, my
dear, if they should condescend to reply to your communications-which
our joint experience renders most improbable-far be it from me to be a
barrier to your wishes."
   The matter being thus amicably settled, Mr. Micawber gave Mrs. Micaw-
ber his arm, and, glancing at the heap of books and papers lying before
Traddles on the table, said they would leave us to ourselves ; which they
ceremoniously did.
   "My dear Copperfield," said Traddles, leaning back in his chair when
they were gone, and looking at me with an affection that made his eyes
red, and his hair all kinds of shapes, " I don't make any excuse for
troubling you with business, because I know you are deeply interested
in it, and it may divert your thoughts. My dear boy, I hope you are
not worn out ? "
   "I am quite myself," said I, after a pause. "We have more cause
to think of my aunt than of any one. You know how much she has
done."
   " Surely, surely," answered Traddles. "Who can forget it ! "
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           549
    "But even that is not all," said I. "During the last fortnight, some
 new trouble has vexed her; and she has been in and out of London every
 day. Several times she has gone out early, and been absent until evening.
 Last night, Traddles, with this journey before her, it was almost midnight
 before she came home. You know what her consideration for others is.
 She will not tell me what has happened to distress her."
   My aunt, very pale, and with deep lines in her face, sat immovable
 until I had finished ; when some stray tears found their way to her cheeks,
 and she put her hand on mine.
   " I t 'S nothing, Trot ; it 'S nothing. There will be no more of it. You
 shall know by and by. Now Agnes, my dear, let us attend to these
affairs."
   "I must do Mr. Micawber the justice to say," Traddles began, 'c that
although he would appear not to have worked to any good account for
himself, he is a most untiring man when he works for other people. I
never saw such a fellow. If he always goes on in the same way, he
must be, virtually, about two hundred years old, at present. The heat
into which he has been continually putting himself; and the distracted and
impetuous manner in which he has been diving, day and night, among
papers and books ; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he
has written me between this house and Mr. Wickfield's, and often
across the table when he has been sitting opposite, and might much more
easily have spoken; is quite extraordinary."
   "Letters ! " cried my aunt. " I believe he dreams in letters ! "
   " There 'S Mr. Dick, too,"     said Traddles, " has been doing wonders !
As soon as he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep, whom he kept
in such charge as I never saw exceeded, he began to devote himself to
Mr. Wickfield. And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations
we have been making, and his real usef~~lness      in extracting, and copying,
and fetching, and carrying, have been quite stimulating to us."
   " Dick is a very remarkable man," exclaimed my aunt; " and I always
said he was. Trot, you know it! "
   "I am happy to say,Miss Wickfield," pursued Traddles, at once with great
delicacy and with great earnestness, "that in your absence Mr. Wickfield
has considerably improved. Relieved of the incubus that had fastened
upon him for so long a time, and of the dreadful apprehensions under
which he had lived, he is hardly the same person. At times, even
his impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on par-
ticular points of business, has recovered itself very much; and he has been
able to assist us in making some things clear, that we should have found
very difficult indeed, if not hopeless, without him. But, what I have
to do is to come to results; which are short enough; not to gossip
on all the hopeful circumstances I have observed, or I shall never have
done."
   His natural manner and agreeable simplicity made it transparent that
he said this to put us in good heart, and to enable Agnes to hear her
father mentioned with greater confidence ; but it was not the less pleasant
for that.
   " Now, let me see," said Traddles, looking among the papers on the
table. " Having counted our funds, and reduced to order a great mass
550            THE PERSONAL SISTORY          AND EXPERIENCE

of unintentional confusion in the first place, and of wilful confusion and
falsification in the second, we take it to be clear that Mr. Wickfield might
now wind up his business, and his agency-trust, and exhibit no deficiency
 or defalcation whatever."
    " Oh, thank Heaven ! " cried Agnes, fervently.
    " But," said Traddies, "the surplus that would be left as his means
of support-and I suppose the house to be sold, even in saying this-
would be so small, not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of
pounds, that perhaps, Miss Wickfield, it would be best to consider whether
he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been
receiver. His friends might advise him, you know; now he is free. You
yourself, Miss Wickfield-Copperfield-I-"
    " I have considered it, Trotwood," said Agnes, looking to me, " and

I feel that it ought not to be, and must not be ; even on the recommenda-
tion of a friend to whom I am so grateful, and owe so much."
    " I will not say that I recommend it," obserred Traddles. " I think
it right to suggest it. No more."
    " I am happy to hear you say so," answered Agnes, steadily, "for it
gives me hope, almost assuranee, that we think alike. Dear Mr. Traddles
and dear Trotwood, papa once free with honor, what could I wish for !
I have always aspired, if I could have released him from the toils in which
he was held, to render back some little portion of the love and care I owe
him, and to devote my life to him. I t has been, for years, the utmost
height of my hopes. To take our future on myself, will be the next
great happiness-the next to his release from all trust and responsibility
-that I can know."
    " Have you thought how, Agnes ? "

    " Often ! I am not afraid, dear Trotwood. I am certain of success.
So many people know me here, and think kindly of me, that I am certain.
Don't mistrust me. Our wants are not niany. If I rent the dear old
 house, and keep a school, I shall be useful and happy."
    The calm fervor of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly, first the
dear old house itself, and then my solitary home, that my heart was too
full for speech. Traddles pretended for a little while to be busily looking
among the papers.
    " Next, Miss Trotwood," said Traddles, "that property of yours."
    "Well, sir," sighed my aunt. "All I have got to say about it, is,
that if it 'S gone, I can bear i t ; and if it 'S not gone, I shall be glad to get
it back."
    'cI t was originally, I think, eight thousand pounds, Consols ? " said
Traddles.
    " Right ! " replied my aunt.

    " I can't account for more than five," said Traddles, with an air of
perplexity.
    "-thousand,       do you mean?" inquired my aunt, with uncommon
composure, " or pounds ? "
    " Five thousand pounds," said Traddles.

      I t was all there was," returned my aunt. " I sold three, myself.
 One, I paid for your articles, Trot, my dear; and the other two I have by
me. When I lost the rest, I thought it wise to say nothing about that
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          551
 sum, but to keep it secretly for a rainy day. I wanted to see how you would
 come out of the trial, Trot ; and you came out nobly-persevering, self-
 reliant, self-denying ! So did Dick. Don't speak to me, for I find my
 nerves a little shaken ! "
    Nobody would have thought so, to see her sitting upright, with her
 arms folded ; but she had wonderful self-command.
    "Then I am delighted to say," cried Traddles, beaming with joy, "that
 we have recovered the whole money ! "
    "Don't congratulate me, anybody ! " exclaimed my aunt. " How so,
sir ? "
    " You believed it had been misappropriated by Mr. Wickfield? " saici

Traddles.
    " Of course I did," said my aunt, "and was therefore easily silenced.

Agnes, not a word ! "
    "And indeed," said Traddles, " i t was sold, by virtue of the power of
 management he held from you; but I needn't say by whom sold, or on
whose actual signature. It was afterwards pretended to Mr. Tlrickfield, by
that rascal,-and proved, too, by figures,-that he had possessed himself of
the money (on general instructions, he said) to keep other deficiencies and
difficulties from the light. Mr. Wickfield, being so weak and helpless in
his hands as to pay you, afterwards, several sums of interest on a pretended
principal which he knew did not exist, made himself, unhappily, a party
to the fraud."
    "And at last took the blame upon himself," added my aunt ; "and
wrote me a mad letter, charging himself with robbery, and wrong unheard
of. Upon which I paid him a visit early one morning, called for a candle,
burnt the letter, and told him if he ever could right me and himself, to do
it ; and if he couldn't, to keep his own counsel for his daughter's sake.-
If anybody speaks to me, I 1' 1 leave the house ! "
   TTe all remained quiet ; Agnes covering her face.
   " Well, my dear friend," said my aunt, after a pause, "and you have
really extorted the money back from him ? "
   " Why, the fact is," returned Traddles, " Mr. Micawber had so com-
pletely hemmed him in, and was always ready with so many new points
if an old one failed, that he could not escape from us. A most remark-
able circumstance is, that I really don't think he grasped this sum even
so much for the gratification of his avarice, which was inordinate, as in
the hatred he felt for Copperfield. He said so to me, plainly. He said
he would even have spent as much, to baulk or injure Copperfield."
   " H a ! " said my aunt, knitting her brows thoughtfully, and glancing at
Agnes. " And what's become of him? "
   " I don't know.      He left here," said Traddles, "with his mother, who
had been clamouring, and beseeching, and disclosing, the whole time.
They went away by one of the London night coaches, and I know
no more about him; except that his malevolence to me at parting
was audacious. He seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted
to me, than to Mr. Micawber ; wliich I consider (as I told him) quite a
compliment."
    " Do you suppose he has any money, Traddles ? " I asked.

   " Oh dear, yes, I should think so," he replied, shaking his head,
552            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPER~ENCE

seriously. " I should say he must have pocketed a good deal, in one way or
other. But, I think you would find, Copperfield, if you had an oppor-
tunity of observing his course, that money would never keep that man
out of mischief. H e is such an incarnate hypocrite, that whatever object
he pursues, he must pursue crookedly. I t 'S his only compensation for the
outward restraints he puts upon himself. Always creeping along the
ground to some small end or other, lie will always magnify every object in
the way ; and consequently will hate and suspect every body that comes, in
the most innocent manner, between him and it. So, the crooked courses
will become crookeder, at any moment, for the least reason, or for none.
I t 'S only necessary to consider his history here," said Traddles, " t o
know that."
       He 'S a monster of meanness ! " said my aunt.
     "Really I don't know about that," observed Traddles thoughtfully.
   Many people can be very mean, when they give their minds to it."
     " And now, touching Mr. Micawber," said my aunt.
     "Well, really," said Traddles, cheerfully, "I must, once more, give
 Mr. Micawber high praise. But for his having been so patient and per-
 severing for so long a time, we never could have hoped to do anything
 worth speaking of. And I think we ought to consider that Mr. Micawber
 did right, for right's sake, when we reflect what terms he might have made
 with Uriah Heep himself, for his silence."
     " I think so too," said I.
     " Now, what would you give him? " inquired my aunt.
     "Oh! Before you come to that," said Traddles, a little disconcerted,
 " I am afraid I thought it discreet to omit (not being able to carry every-
 thing before me) two points, in making this lawless adjustment-for it's
 perfectly lawless from beginning to end-of          a difficult affair. Those
 I. 0. U.'s, and so forth, which Mr. Nicawber gave him for the advances
 he had-"
     "Well ! They must be paid," said my aunt.
     "Yes, but I don't know when they may be proceeded on, or where they
 are," rejoined Traddles, opening his eyes ; '' and I anticipate, that, between
 this time and his departure, Mr. Micawber will be constantly arrested, or
 taken in execution."
     " Then he must be constantly set free again, and taken out of execution,"
 said my aunt. " What 'S the amount altogether ? "
     " Why, Mr. Micawber has entered the transactions-he calls them
 transactions-with great form, in a book," rejoined Traddles, smiling;
 " and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds, five."
     "Now, what shall we give him, that sum included? " said my aunt.
 "Agnes, my dear, yon and I can talk about division of it afterwards.
 What should it be? Five hundred pounds? "
     Upon this, Traddles and I both struck in at once. We both recom-
 mended a small sum in money, and the payment, without stipulation
 to Mr. Micawber, of the Uriah claims as they came in. We proposed
 that the family should. have their passage and their outfit, and a
 hundred pounds; and that Mr. Mica~vber's arrangement for the repay-
 ment of the advances should be gravely entered into, as it might be
 wholesome for him to suppose himself under that responsibility. To this,

I added the suggestion, that I should give some explanation of his
character and history to Mr. Peggotty, who I knew could be relied on;
and that to Mr. Peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion of ad-
vancing another hundred. I further proposed to interest Mr. Micawber in
Mr. Peggotty, by confiding so much of Mr. Peggotty's story to him as I
might feel justified in relating, or might think expedient ; and to endeavour
to bring each of them to bear upon the other, for the common advantage.
We all entered warmly into these views ; and I may mention at once, that
the principals themselves did so, shortly afterwards, with perfect good will
and harmony.
   Seeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again, I
reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted.
   "You and your aunt will excuse me, Copperfield, if I touch upon a
painful theme, as I greatly fear I shall," said Traddles, hesitating; "but
I think it necessary to bring it to your recollection. On the day of Mr.
Micawber's memorable denunciation, a threatening allusion was made by
Uriah Heep to your aunt's-husband."
   My aunt, retaining her stiff position, and apparent composure, assented
with a nod.
    " Perhaps," observed Traddles, "it was mere purposeless impertinence?"

    " No," returned my aunt.

    "There was-pardon         me-really such a person, and at all in his
power ? " hinted Traddles.
   " Yes, my good friend," said my aunt.
   Traddles, with a perceptible lengthening of his face, explained that he
had not been able to approach this subject ; that it had shared the fate of
Mr. &Iicawber7sliabilities, in not being comprehended in the terms he had
made ; that we were no longer of any authority with Uriah Heep ; and
that if he could do us, or any of us, any injury or annoyance, no doubt
he would.
   My aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their way
to her cheeks.
   "You are quite right," she said. " I t was very thoughtful to
mention it."
   " Can I-or     Copperfield-do anything ? " asked Traddles, gently.
   "Nothing," said my aunt. " I thank you many times. Trot, my
dear, a vain threat ! Let us have Mr. and Mrs. Micawber back. And
don't any of you speak to me ! " With that, she smoothed her dress, and
sat, with her upright carriage, looking at the door.
   "Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber ! " said my aunt, when they entered.
"We have been discussing your emigration, with many apologies to you
for keeping you out of the room so long; and I'll tell you what arrange-
ments we propose."
   These she explained, to the unbounded satisfaction of the family,-
children and all being then present,-and        so much to the awakening of
Mr. Micawber's punctual habits in the opening stage of all bill trans-
 actions, that he could not be dissuaded from immediately rushing out, in
 the highest spirits, to buy the stamps for his notes of hand. But, his joy
received a sudden check ; for within five minutes, he returned in the custody
of a sheriff 'S officer, informing us, in a flood of tears, that all was lost.
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

We, being quite prepared for this event, ahich was of course a proceed-
ing of Uriah Heep's, soon paid the money; and in five minutes more
Mr. Micawber was seated at the table, lilling up the stamps with an ex-
pression of perfect joy, M hich only that congenial employment, or the
making of punch, could impart in full completeness to his shining
face. To see him at work on the stamps, with the relish of an artist,
touching them like pictures, looking at them sideways, taking weighty
notes of clates and amounts in his pocket-book, and contemplating
them           finished, with a high sense of their precious value, was a
sight indeed.
   "Now, the best thing you can do, sir, if you 'l1 allow me to advise
you," said my aunt, after silently observing him, " is to abjure that occu-
pation for evermore."
   "Madam," replied Mr. Micawber, "it is my intention to register such
a vow on the virgin page of the future. Mrs. Micawber will attest it.
I trust," said Mr. Micawber, solemnly, "that my son Wilkins will ever
bear in mind, that he had infinitely better put his fist in the fire, than use
it to handle the serpents that have poisoned the life-blood of his unhappy
parent ! " Deeply affected, and changed in a moment to the image of
despair, Mr. Micawb~rregarded the serpents with a look of gloomy
abhorrence (in which his late admiration of them was not quite subdued),
folded them up, and put them in his pocket.
    This closed the proceedings of the evening. We were weary with
sorrow and fatigue, and my aunt and I were to return to London on the
morrow. It was arranged that the Micawbers should follow us, after
effecting a sale of their goods to a broker; that Mr. JtTickfield's affairs
 should be brought to a settlement, with all convenient speed, under
 the direction of Traddles; and that Agnes should also come to
London, pending those arrangements. M-e passed the night at the old
house, which, freed from the presence of the Heeps, secmed purged
 of a disease; and I lay in my old room, like a shipwrecked wariderer
come home.
    We went back next day to my aunt's house-not to mine ; and when
she and I sat alone, as of old, before going to bed, she said :
    "Trot, do you really wish to know what I have had upon my mind
latelv ? "
    " Indeed I do, aunt.     If there ever was a time when I felt unwilliilg
that you should have a sorrow or anxiety which I could not share, it is
now."
    " You have had sorrow enough, child," said my aunt, affectionately,
 "without the addition of my little miseries. I could have no other
motive, Trot, in keeping anything from you."
    " I know that well," said I.    " But tell me now."
    "JVould yon ride with me a little way to-morrow morning?" asked
my aunt.
    '' Of course."
    "At nine," said she. " I '11 tell you then, my dear."
    At nine, accordingly, we went out in a little chariot, and drove to
 London. We drove a long way through the streets, until we came to one
 of the large hospitals. Standing hard by the building was a plain hearse.
                          OE DAVID COPPERELELD.

 The driver recognised my aunt, and, in obedience to a motion of her hand
 at the window, drove slowly off; we following.
    " You understand it now, Trot," said my aunt. " EIe is gone ! "
    " Did he die in the hospital? "

    ' L Yes."
     -


    She sat immovable beside me; but, again I saw the stray tears on her
 face.
    " tIe was there once before," said my aunt presently. '"IJe was ailing
 a long time-a shattered, broken man, these many years. When he knew
 his state in this last illness, he asked them to send for me. EIe was sorry
 then. Very sorry."
    "YOUwent, I know, aunt."
    " I went.    I was with him a good deal afterwards."
    " He died the night before u e went to Canterburj ? " said I.

    l\iy aunt nodded. " No one can harm him now," she said. " It was
 a vain threat."
    We drore away, out of town, to the churchyard at Hornsey. "Better
 here than in the streets," said my aunt. " He was born here."
    We alighted; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember
 well, where the service was read consigning it to the dust.
    " Six-and-thirty years ago, this day, my dear," said my aunt, as we

 walked back to the chariot, " I was married. God forgive us all ! "
    We took our seats in silence; and so she sat beside me for a long time,
 holding my hand. At length she suddenly burst into tears, and sald :
    " II? was a fine-looking man when I married him, Trot-and         he was
 sadly changed ! "
    I t did not last long. After the relief of tears, she soon became com-
 posed, and even cheerful. Her nerves were a little shaken, she said, or
she would not have given way to it. God forgive us all !
    So we rode back to her little cottage at Highgate, where we found the
following short note, which had arrived by that mornmg's post from
Mr. Micawber :

                             CHAPTER LT.
                                  'TEMPEST.

   I xow approach an event in my life, so indelible, so awful, so bound by
an infinite variety of ties to all that has preceded it, in these pages, that,
from the beginning of my narrative, I have seen it growing larger and
larger as I advanced, like a great tower in a plain, and throwing its
fore-cast shadow even on the incidents of my childish days.
   For years after it occurred, I dreamed of it often. I have started up
so vividly impressed by it, that its fury has yet seemed raging in my
quiet room, in the still night. I dream of it sometimes, though at
lengthened and uncertain intervals, to this hour. I have an association
between it and a stormy wind, or the lightest mention of a sea-shore, as
strong as any of which my mind is conscious. As plainly as I behold what
happened, I will try to write it down. I do not recal it, but see it done;
for it happens again before me.
   The time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship, my
good old nurse (almost broken-hearted for me, when we first met) came
up to London. 1 was constantly with her, and her brother, and the
Micawbers (they being very much together); but Emily I never saw.
   One evening when the time was close at hand, I was alone with Peg-
gotty and her brother. Our conversation turned on Ham. She described
to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her, and how manfully and
quietly he had borne himself. Most of all, of late, when she believed
he was most tried. I t was a subject of which the affectionate creature
never tired; and our interest in hearing the many examples which she,
who was so much with him, had to relate, was equal to hers in relating
them.
   My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at Higligate ;
I intending to go abroad, and she to return to her house at Dover. We
had a temporary lodging in Covent Garden. As I walked home to it,
after this evening's conversation, reflecting on what had passed between
Ham and myself when I was last at Yarmouth, I wavered in the original
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

purpose I had formed, of leaving a letter for Emily when I should take
 leave of her uncle on board the ship, and thought it would be better to
write to her now. She might desire, I thought, after receiving my com-
munication, to send some parting word by me to her unhappy lover. I
ought to give her the opportunity.
    I therefore sat down in my room, before going to bed, and wrote to
her. I told her that I had seen him, and that he had requested me to
tell her what I have already written in its place in these sheets. I faith-
fully repeated it. I had no need to enlarge upon it, if I had had the
right. Its deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or
any man. I left it out, to be sent round in the morning ; with a line to
Mr. Peggotty, requesting him to give it to her; and went to bed at
daybreak.
    I was weaker than I knew then ; and, not falling asleep until the sun was
up, lay late, and unrefreshed, next day. I was roused by the silent presence
of my aunt at my bedside. I felt it in my sleep, as I suppose we all do
feel such things.
    "Trot, my dear," she said, when I opened my eyes, " I couldn't make
up my mind to disturb you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come u p ? "
    I replied yes, and he soon appeared.
    " Mas'r Davy," he said, when we had shaken hands, " I giv Em'ly
your letter, sir, and she writ this heer; and begged of me fur to ask you
to read it, and if you see no hurt in't, to be so kind as take charge
on 't."
    " Have you read it ? " said I.
    H e nodded sorrowfully. I opened it, and read as follows :
       I have got your message. Oh, what can I write, to thank you for .your good
                                                                             .
  and blessed-kindness to me !
    'L I have put the words close to my heart. I shall keep them till I die. They
  are sharp thorns, but they are such comfort. I have prayed over them, oh, I
  have prayed so much. When I find what you are, and what uncle is, I think
  what God must be, and can cry to him.
    "Good bye for ever. Now, my dear, my friend, good bye for ever in this
  world. I n another world, if I am forgiven, I may wake a child and come to you.
  All thanks and blessings. Farewell, evermore !"

   This, blotted with tears, was the letter.
   " May I tell her as you doen't see no hurt in 't, and as you'll be so

kind as take charge on 't, Mas'r Davy ? " said Mr. Peggotty, when I had
read it.
   " Unquestionably," said I-" but I am thinking-"
   " Yes, Mas'r Davy ? "
   " I am thinking," said I, " that I'll go down again toyarmouth. There 'S

time, and to spare, for me to go and come back before the ship sails. My
mind is constantly running on him, in his solitude ; to put this letter of
her writing in his hand at this time, and to enable you to tell her, in the
moment of parting, that he has got it, will be a kindness to both of them.
I solemnly accepted his commission, dear good fellow, and cannot dis-
charge it too completely. The journey is nothing to me. I am restless,
and shall be better in motion. I 'l1 go down to-night."
   Though he anxiously endeavoured to dissuade me, I saw that he was of
558           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND XXPERIENCE

my mind; and this, if I had required to be confirmed in my intention,
would have had the effect. He went round to the coach-office, at my
request, and took the box-seat for me on the mail. I n the even~ngP
started, by that conveyance, down the road I had traversed under so many
vicissitudes.
    " Don't you think that," I asked the coachman, in the first stage out
of London, " a very remarkable sky? I don't remember to have sren one
like it."
    " Nor I-not    equal to it," he replied. " That 'S wind, sir. There 'l1
be mischief done at sea, I expect, before long."
    It was a murky confusion-here and there blotted with a colour like
the colour of the smoke from damp fuel-of flying clouds, tossed up into
most remarkable heaps, suggesting greater heights in the cloucls than there
were depths below them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth,
through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong, as if, in :i
dread disturbance of the laws of nature, she had lost her way and were
frightened. There had been a wind all day; and it was rising then, with
an extraordinary great sonnd. I n another hour it had much increased,
and the sky was more overcast, and it blew hard.
    But, as the night advanced, the clouds closing in and densely over-
spreading the whole sky, then very dark, it came on to blow, harder and
harder. It still increased, until our horses could scarcely face the wind.
Many times, in the dark part of the night (it was then late in September,
 when the nights were not short), the leaders turned about, or cdme to a
 dead stop; and we were often in serious apprehension that the coach
 would be blown over. Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this storm,
 like showers of steel; and, at those times, when there was any shelter of
 trees or lee walls to be got, we were fain to stop, in a sheer impossibility
 of continuing the struggle.
    When the day broke, it blew harder and harder. I had been in Yar-
 mouth when the seamen said it blew great gums, but I had never known
 the like of this, or anything approaching to it. We came to Norwich-
 very late, having had to fight every inch of ground since we were ten
 miles out of London ; and foulid a cluster of people in the market-place,
 who had risen from their beds in the night, fearful of falling chimneys.
 Some of these, congregating about the inn-y ard while we changed horses,
 told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high church-tower,
 and flung into a bye street, which they then blocked up. Others had to
 tell of country people, coming in from neighbouring villages, who had
 seen great trees lying torn out of the earth, and whole r~cksscattered
 about the roads and fields. Still, there was no abatement In the storm,
 but it blew harder.
    As we struggled on, nearer and nearer to the sea, from which this
 mighty wind was blowing dead on shore, its force became more and more
 terrific. Long before we saw the sea, its spray was on our lips, and
 showered salt rain upon us. The water was out, over miles and miles of
 the flat country adjacent to Yarmouth ; and every sheet and puddle lashed
 its banks, and had its stress of little breakers setting heavlly towards us.
 When we came within sight of the sea, the waves on the horizon, caught
 at intervals above the rolling abyss, were like glimpses OF another shore
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          559
  with towers and bnildings. When at last we got into the town, the
  people came out to their doors, all aslant, and with streaming hair,
  making a wonder of the mail that had come through such a night.
     I put up at the old inn, and went down to look at the sea; staggering
  along the street, which was strewn with sand and seaweed, and with flying
  blotches of sea-foam ; afraid of falling slates and tiles ; and holding by
 people I met, at angry corners. Coming near the beach, I saw, not only
 the boatmen, but half the people of the town, lurking behind buildings ;
 some, now and then braving the fnry of the storm to look away to sea,
 and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag back.
     Joining these groups, I fonnd bewailing women whose husbands were
 away in herring or oyster boats, which there was too much reason to
 think might have foundered before they could run in anywhere for safety.
 Grizzled old sailors were among the people, shaking their heads, as they
 looked from water to sky, and muttering to one another ; ship-owners,
 excited and uneasy ; children, huddling together, and peering into older
 faces ; even stout mariners, disturbed and anxious, levelling their glasses
 at the sea from behind places of shelter, as if they were surveying an
enemy.
    The tremendons sea itself, when I could find sufficient pause to look at
it, in the agitation of thc blinding wind, the flying stones and sand, and
the awful noise, confounded me. As the high watery walls came rolling in,
 and, at their highest, tumbled into surf, they looked as if the least would
 engulf the town. As the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar, it
 seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach, as if its purpose were to
undermine the earth. When some white-headed billows thundered on,
 and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the land, every frag-
ment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath,
rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster. Vndulating
hills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys (with a solitary storm-bird
 sometimes skimming through them) were lifted np to hills ; masses of water
 shivered and shook the beach with a booming sound; every shape tumul-
tuously rolled on, as soon as made, to change its shape and place, and beat
another shape and place away ; the ideal shore on the horizon, with its
towers and buildings, rose and fell; the clouds flew fast and thick; I
seemed to see a rending and upheaving of all nature.
    Kot finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind-for
it is still remembered down there, as the greatest ever known to blow
upon that coast-had      brought together, I made my way to his house.
It was shut; and es no one answered to my knocking, I went, by back
ways and bye-lanes, to the yard where he worked. I learned, there, that
he had gone to Lowestoft, to meet some sudden exigency of ship-
repairing in which his skill was required; bnt that he would be back
to-morrow morning, in good time.
    I went back to the inn ; and when I had washed and dressed, and tried
to sleep, but in vain, it was five o'clock in the afternoon I had not sat
five minutes by the ccffee-room fire, when the walter, coming to stir it, as
an excuse for talking, told me that two colliers had gone down, with all
hands, a few miles away ; and that some other ships had been seen laboring
bard in the Roads, and trying, i n great distress, to keep off-shore. Mercy
560           THX PERSOKAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 on them, and on all poor sailors, said he, if we had another night like
 the last !
    I was very much depressed in spirits; very solitary; and felt an
 uneasiness in Ham's not being there, disproportionate to the occasion.
 I was seriously affected, without knowing how much, by late events;
 and my long exposure to the fierce wind had confused me. There was
 that jumble in my thoughts and recollections, that I had lost the clear
 arrangement of time and distance. Thus, if I had gone out into the town,
 I should not have been surprised, I think, to encounter some one who I
 knew must be then in London. So to speak, there was in these respects
 a curious inattention in my mind. Yet it was busy, too, with all the
remembrances the place naturally awakened; and they were particularly
 distinct and vivid.
    I n this state, the waiter's dismal intelligence about the ships imme-
diately connected itself, without any cffort of my volition, with my uneasi-
ness about Ham. I was persuaded that I had an apprehension of his
returning from Lowestoft by sea, and being lost. This grew so strong
with me, that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner,
arid ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at
all likely? If he gave me the least reason to think so, I would go over
to Lowestoft and prevent it by bringing him with me.
    I hastily ordered my dinner, and went back to the yard. I was none
too soon ; for the boat-builder, with a lantern in his hand, was locking the
yard-gate. H e quite laughed, when I asked him the question, and said
 there was no fear; no man in his senses, or out of them, would put OK
 in such a gale of wind, least of all Ham Peggotty, who had been born to
 seafaring.
    So sensible of this, beforehand, that I had really felt ashamed of doing
 what I was nevertheless impelled to do, I went back to the inn. If
 such a wind could rise, I think it was rising. The howl and roar, the
rattling of the doors and windows, the rumbling in the chimneys, the
apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me, and the prodigious
tumult of the sea, were more fearful than in the morning. But there
was now a aereat darkness besides : and that invested the storm with new
terrors, real and fanciful.
   I could not eat, I could not sit still, I could not continue stedfast to
anything. Something within me, faintly answering to the storm without,
tossed up the depths of my memory, and made a tumult in them. Yet,
in all the hurry of my thoughts, wild running with the thundering sea,
-the storm, and my uneasiness regarding Ham, were always in the
fore-ground.
   My dinner went away almost untasted, and I tried to refresh myself with
a glass or two of wine. I n vain. I fell into a dull slumber before the fire,
without losing my consciousness, either of the uproar out of doors, or of
the place in which I was. Both became overshadowed by a new and
indefinable horror; and when I awoke-or rather when I shook off the
lethargy that bound me in my chair-my whole frame thrilled with
objectless and unintelligible fear.
   I walked to and fro, tried to read an old gazetteer, listened to the
 awful noises : looked at faces, scenes, and figures in the fire. At length,
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           561
 the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on the wall, tormented me to
 that degree that I resolved to go to bed.
    I t was re-assuring, on such a night, to be told that some of the inn-
 servants had agreed together to sit up until morning. I went to bed,
 exceedingly weary and heavy ; but, on my lying down, all such sensations
 vanished, as if by magic, and I was broad awake, with every sense
 refined.
    For hours I lay there, listening to the wind and water; imagining,
 now, that I heard shrieks out at sea; now, that I distinctly heard the
 firing of signal guns ; and now, the fall of houses in the town. I got up,
 several times, and looked out ; but could see nothing, except the reflection
 in the window-panes of the faint candle I had left burning, and of my
 own haggard face looking in at me from the black void.
    At length, my restlessness attained to such a pitch, that I hurried on
my clothes, and went down stairs. I n the large kitchen, where I dimly
 saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams, the watchers
were clustered together, in various attitudes, about a table, purposely
moved away from the great chimney, and brought near the door. A
pretty girl, who had her ears stopped with her apron, and her eyes upon
the door, screamed when I appeared, supposing me to be a spirit; but the
others had more presence of mind, and were glad of an addition to their
company. One man, referring to the topic they had been discussing,
 asked me whether I thought the souls of the collier-crews who had gone
down, were out in the storm?
    I remained there, 'l dare say, two hours. Once, I opened the yard-
gate, and looked into the empty street. The sand, the sea-weed,
and the flakes of foam, were driving by; and I was obliged to call for
assistance before I could shut the gate again, and make it fast against
the wind.
    There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber, when I at length
returned to i t ; but I was tired now, and, getting into bed again, fell-off
a tower and down a precipice-into the depths of sleep. I have an irnpres-
siou that for a long time, though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a
variety of scenes, it was always blowing in my dream. At length, I lost
that feeble hold upon reality, and was engaged with two dear friends, but
who they were I don't know, at the siege of some town in a roar of
cannonading.
    The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant, that I could not
hear something I much desired to hear, until I made a great exertion
and awoke. I t was broad day-eight or nine o'clock ; the storm raging, in
lieu of the batteries ; and some one knocking and calling at my door.
    " What is the matter?" I cried.
    " A wreck ! Close by ! "
    I sprung out of bed, and asked what wreck?
    " A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and wine. Make
haste, sir, if you want to see her! I t 'S thought, down on the beach,
she 'll go to pieces every moment."
    The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase ; and I wrapped
myself in my clothes as quickly as I could, and ran into the street.
    Numbers of people were there before me, all running in one direction,
                                                             00

to the beach. I ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and soon
came facing the wild sea.
    The wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not more
sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of, had been diminished
by the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds. But, the sea,
having upon it the additional agitation of the whole night, was infinitely
more terrific than when I had seen it last. Every appearance it had then
presented, bore the expression of being swelled; and the height to which
the breakers rose, and, looking over one another, bore one another down,
and rolled in, in interminable hosts, was most appalling.
    I n the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves, and in the
crowd, and the unspeakable confusion, and my first breathless efforts to
stand against the weather, I was so confused that I looked out to sea for
the wreck, and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves. A
half-dressed boatman, standing next me, pointed with his bare arm
(a tattoo'd arrow on it, pointing in the same direction) to the left. Then,
0 great ITeaven, I saw it, close in upon us !
    One mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the deck, and lay
over the side, entangled in a maze of sail and rigging ; and all that ruin,
as the ship rolled and beat-which she did without a moment's pause,
and with a violence quite inconceivable-beat the side as if it would
stave it in. Some efforts were even then being made, to cut this portion of
the wreck away; for, as the ship, which was broadside on, turned towards
us in her rolling, I plainly descried her people at work with axes, espe-
cially one active figure with long curling hair, conspicuous among the rest.
But, a great cry, which was audible even above the wind and water, rose
from the shore at this moment ; the sea, sweeping over the rolling wreck
made a clean breach, and carried men, spars, casks, planks, bulwarks,
heaps of such toys, into the boiling surge.
    The second mast was yet standing, with the rags of a rent sail, and a
 wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro. The ship had
 struck once, the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted
in and struck again. I understood him to add that she was parting amid-
ships, and I could readily suppose so, for the rolling and beating were too
tremendous for any human work to suffer long. As he spoke, there was
another great cry of pity from the beach; four men arose with the
wreck out of the deep, clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast;
uppermost, the active figure with the curling hair.
    There was a bell on board; and as the ship rolled and dashed, like a
desperate creature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep of her
deck, as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore, now nothing
but her keel, as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea, the
bell rang; and its sound, the knell of those unhappy men, was borne
towards us on the wind. Again we lost her, and again she rose. Two
men were gone. The agony on shore increased. Men groaned, and
 clasped their hands ; women shrieked, and turned away their faces. Some
ran wildly up and down along the beach, crying for help where no help
 could be. I found myself one of these, frantically imploring a knot of
 sailors whom I knew, not to let those two lost creatures perish before
our eyes.

   They were making out to me, in an agitated way-I don't know how,
for the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough to understand-
that the life-boat had been bravely manned an hour ago, and could do
nothing; and that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt to wade
off with a rope, and establish a communication with the shore, there was
nothing left to try ; when I noticed that some new sensation moved the
people on the beach, and saw them part, and Ham come breaking through
them to the front.
   I ran to him-as well as I know, to repeat my appeal for help. But,
distracted though I was, by a sight so new to me and terrible, the determi-
nation in his face, and his look, out to sea-exactly the same look as I
remembered in connexion with the morning after Emily's flight-awoke
me to a knowledge of his danger. I held him back with both arms;
and implored the men with whom I had been speaking, not to listen to
him, not to do murder, not to let him stir from off that sand !
   Another cry arose on shore ; and looking to the wreck, we saw the
cruel sail, with blow on blow, beat off the lower of the two men, and fly
up in triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast.
   Against such a sight, and against such determination as that of the
calmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people
present, I might as hopefully have entreated the wind. " Mas'r Davy,"
he said, cheerily grasping me by both hands, "if my time is come, 'tis
come. If 'tan't, I '11 bide it. Lord above bless you, and bless all ! Mates,
make me ready ! I 'm a going off !"
   I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance, where the people
around me made me stay ; urging, as1 confusedlyperceived, that he was bent
on going, with help or without, and that I should endanger the precautions
for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested. I don't know
what I answered, or what they rejoined; but, I saw hurry on the beach,
and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there, and pene-
trating into a circle of figures that hid him from me. Then, I saw him
standlng alone, in a seaman's frock and trowsers : a rope in his hand, or
slung to his wrist : another round his body : and several of the best men
holding, at a little distance, to the latter, which he laid out himself, slack
upon the shore, at his feet.
   The wreck, even to my unpractised eye, was breaking up. I saw that
she was parting in the middle, and that the life of the solitary man upon
the mast hung by a thread. Still, he clung to it. He had a singular red
cap on,-not like a sailor's cap, but of a finer color ; and as the few yielding
planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged, and his anticipative
death-knell rung, he was seen by all of us to wave it. I saw him do it
now, and thought I was going distracted, when his action brought an
old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend.
   Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence of suspended
breath behind him, and the storm before, until there was a great retiring
wave, when, with a backward glance at those who held the rope which
was made fast round his body, he dashed in after it, and in a moment
was buffetting with the water; rising with the hills, faliing with the
valleys, lost beneath the foam ; then drawn again to land. They hauled
in hastily.

    He was hurt. I saw blood on his face, from where I stood; but he
 took no thought of that. H e seemed hurriedly to give them some direc-
 tions for leaving him more free-or so I judged from the motion of his
 arm-and was gone as before.
    And now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, falling with the
 valleys, lost beneath the rugged foam, borne in towards the shore, borne
 on towards the ship, striving hard and valiantly. The distance was
 nothing, but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly. At
 length he neared the wreck. Ile was so near, that with one more of his
 vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it,-when, a high, green, vast
hill-side of water, moving on shoreward, from beyond the ship, he seemed
 to leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was gone !
    Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere cask had been
broken, in running to the spot where they were hauling in. Consternation
was in every face. They drew him to niy very feet-insensible-dead.
H e was carried to the nearest house ; and, no one preventing me now, I
remained near him, busy, while every means of restoration were tried; but
he had been beaten to death by the great wave, and his generous heart
was stilled for ever.
    As I sat beside the bed, when hope was abandoned and all was done, a
fisherman, who had known me when Emily and I were children, and ever
since, whispered my name at the door.
    "Sir," said he, with tears starting to his weather-beaten face, which,
with his trembling lips, was ashy pale, " will you come over yonder ? "
    The old remembrance that had been recalled to me, was in his look. I
 asked him, terror-stricken, leaning on the arm he held out to support me:
    " Has a body come ashore? "

    H e said, " Yes."
    " Do I know it ? " I asked then.

    He answered nothing.
    But, he led me to the shore. And on that part of it where she and I
had looked for shells, two children-on that part of it where some lighter
fragments of the old boat, blown down last night, had been scattered by
the wind-among the ruins of the home he had wronged-I saw him
lying with his head upon his arm, as I had often seen him lie at school.




                          CI-IL4PTER LVI.
                  THE N E W WOUND, AhTD THE OLD.

   No need, 0 Steerforth, to have said, when we last spoke together, in
that hour which I so little deemed to be our parting-hour-no need to have
said, " Think of me at my best ! " I had done that ever ; and could I
change now, looking on this sight !
   They brought a hand-bier, and laid him on it, and covered him with a
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

flag, and took him up and bore him on towards the houses. All the men
who carried him had known him, and gone sailing with him, and seen him
merry and bold. They carried him through the wild roar, a hush in the
midst of all the tumult; and took him to the cottage where Death was
already.
   But, when they set the bier down on the threshold, they looked at one
another, and at me, and whispered. I knew why. They felt as if it were
not right to lay him down in the same quiet room.
   IVe went into the town, and took our burden to the inn. So soon as
I could at all collect my thoughts, I sent for Joram, and begged him to
provide me a conveyance in which it could be got to London in the night.
I knew that the care of it, and the hard duty of preparing his mother to
receive it, could only rest with me; and I was anxious to discharge that
duty as faithfully as I could.
   I chose the night for the journey, that there might be less curiosity
when I left the town. But, although it was nearly midnight when I came
ont of the yard in a chaise, followed by what I had in charge, there were
many people waiting. At intervals, along the town, and even a little
way out upon the road, I saw more; but at length only the bleak night
and the open country were around me, and the ashes of my youthful
friendship.
   Upon a mellow autumn day, about noon, when the ground was per-
fumed by fallen leaves, and many more, in beautiful tints of yellow, red,
and brown, yet hung upon the trees, through which the sun was shining,
I arrived at Highgate. I walked the last mile, thinking as I went along
of what I had to do ; and left the carriage that had followed me all through
the night, awaiting orders to advance.
   The honse, when I came up to it, looked just the same. Not a blind
was raised; no sign of life was in the dull paved court, with its covered
way leading to the disused door. The wind had quite gone down, and
nothing moved.
   I had not, at first, the comage to ring at the gate; and wheii I did
ring, my errand seemed to me to be expressed in the very sound of the
bell. The little parlour-maid came out, with the key in her hand; and
looking earnestly at me as she unloclred the gate, said:
   " I beg your pardon, sir.    Are you ill? "
   " I have been much agitated, and am fatigued."
   " I s anything the matter, sir ?-Mr.   James? -"
   " Hush!"    said I. "Yes, something has happened, that I have to
break to Mrs. Steerforth. She is at home? "
   The girl anxiously replied that her mistress was very seldom out now,
even in a carriage; that she kept her room; that she saw no company,
but would see me. Her mistress was up, she said, and Miss Dartle was
with her. What message should she take up stairs ?
   Giving her a strict charge to be careful of her manner, and only to
carry in my card and say I waited, I sat down in the drawing-room (which
we had now reached) until she should come back. Its former pleasant air
of occupation was gone, and the shutters were half closed. The harp
had not been used for many and many a day. His picture, as a boy, was
there. The cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there.
              THE PERSONAL BISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 I wondered if she ever read them now; if she would ever read them
 more !
    The house was so still, that I heard the girl's light step up stairs. On
 her return, she brought a message, to the effect that Mrs. Steerforth was
 an invalid and could not come down; but, that if I would excuse her
being in her chamber, she would be glad to see me. I n a few moments I
stood before her.
    She was in his room; not in her own. I felt, of course, that she had
taken to occupy it, in remembrance of him; and that the many tokens of
his old sports and accomplishments, by which she was surrounded,
remained there, just as he had left them, for the same reason. She mur-
mured, however, even in her reception of me, that she was out of her own
chamber because its aspect was unsuited to her infirmity; and with her
stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth.
    At her chair, as usual, was Rosa Dartle. From the first moment of
her dark eyes resting on me, I saw she knew I was the bearer of evil
tidings. The scar sprung into view that instant. She withdrew herself
a step behind the chair, to keep her own face out of Mrs. Steerforth's
observation ; and scrutinised me with a piercing gaze that never faltered,
never shrunk.
    " I am soiry to observe you are in mourning, sir," said Nrs. Steerforth.
    " I am unhappily a widower," said I,
    "You are very young to know so great a loss," she returned. "I am
 grieved to hear it. I am grieved to hear it. I hope Time will be good
to you."
    " I hope Time," said I, looking at her, "will be good to all of us.
 Dear Nrs. Steerforth, we must all trust to that, in our heaviest mis-
 fortunes."
    The earnestness of my manner, and the tears in my eyes, alarmed her.
 The whole course of her thoughts appeared to stop, and change.
    I tried to command my voice in gently saying his name, but it trembled.
 She repeated it to herself, two or three times, in a low tone. Then,
addressing me, she said, with enforced calmness :
    " My son is ill."
    " Very ill."
    " You have seen him ? "
    " I have."

    " Are you reconciled ? "
    I could not say Yes, I could not say No. She slightly turned her
head towards the spot where Rosa Dartle had been standing at her elbow,
and in that moment I said, by the motion of my lips, to Rosa "Dead ! "
   That Mrs. Steerforth might not be induced to look behind her, and
read, plainly written, what she was not yet prepared to know, I met her
look quickly; but I had seen Rosa Dartle throw her hands up in
the air with vehemence of despair and horror, and then clasp them on
her face.
   The handsome lady-so like, 0 so like!-regarded me with a fixed
look, and put her hand to her forehead. I besought her to be calm, and
prepare herself to bear what I had to tell; but I should rather have
entreated her to weep, for she sat like a stone figure.

    "When I was last here," I faltered, " Miss Dartle told me he was
sailing here and there. The night before last was a dreadful one at sea.
If he were at sea that night, and near a dangerous coast, as it is said
he was; and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship
which -        "
    " Rosa ! " said Mrs. Steerforth, " come to me ! "
    She came, but with no sympathy or gentleness. Her eyes gleamed
like fire as she confronted his mother, and broke into a frightful laugh.
    "Xow," she said, "is your pride appeased, you madwoman? Now
has he made atonement to you-~vith            his life ! Do you hear ?--%is
life ! "
    Mrs. Steerforth, fallen back stiffly in her chair, and making no sound
but a moan, cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare.
    " Aye ! " cried Rosa, smiting herself passionately on the breast, "look
at me ! Moan, and groan, and look at me ! Look here ! " striking the
 scar, " at your dead child's handy work ! "
    The moan the mother uttered, from time to time, went to my heart.
 Always the same. Always inarticulate and stifled. Always accompanied
 with an incapable motion of the head, but with no change of face.
Always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth, as if the jaw
were locked and the face frozen up in pain.
     " Do you remember when he did this ? " she proceeded. '' Do you
remember when, in his inheritance of your nature, and in your pampering
 of his pride and passion, he did this, and disfigured me for life? Look
 at me, marked until I die with his high displeasure ; and moan and groan
 for what you made him ! "
     " Miss Dartle," I entreated her. "For Heaven's sake ----"
     " I will speak ! " she said, turning on me with her lightning eyes. "Be
 silent, you! Look at me, I say, proud mother of a proud false son!
 Moan for your nurtme of him, moan for your corruption of him, moan for
 your loss of him, moan for mine ! "
     She clenched her hand, and trembled through her spare, worn figure,
 as if her passion were killing her by inches.
     "You, resent his selfwill ! " she exclaimed. " YOU, injured by his
 haughty temper! You, who opposed to both, when your hair was grey,
 the qualities which made both when you gave him birth ! You, who from
 his cradle reared him to be what he was, and stunted what he should
 have been ! Are you rewarded, aow, for y o u years of trouble ? "
     " 0 Miss Dartle, shame ! 0 cruel ! "
     " I tell you," she returned, " I will speak to her. No power on earth
 should stop me, while I was standing here ! Have I been silent all these
 years, and shall I not speak now? I loved him better than you ever
 loved him ! " turning on her fiercely. " I could have loved him, and
 asked no return. If I had been his wife, I could have been the slave of
 his caprices for a word of love a-year. I should have been. Who knows
 it better than I ? You were exacting, proud, punctilious, selfish. My
 love would have been devoted-would have trod your paltry whimpering
 under foot ! "
     With flashing eyes, she stamped upon the ground as if she actually
 did it.
 568             THE PEBSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     " Look here! " she said, striking the s c u again, with a relentless

  hand. "When he grew into the better understanding of what lie had
  done, he saw it, and repented of it ! I could sing to him, and talk to him,
  and show the ardor that I felt in all he did, and attain with labor to such
  knowledge as most interested him ; and I attracted him. When he was
 freshest and truest, he loved me. Yes, he did ! Many a time, when you
 were put off with a slight word, he has taken Me to his heart ! "
     She said it with a taunting pride in the midst of her frenzy-for it was
 little less-yet with an eager remembrance of it, in which the smouldering
 embers of a gentler feeling kindled for the moment.
     " I descended-as     I might have known I should, but that he fascinated
 me with his boyish courtship--into a doll, a trifle for the occupation of an
 idle hour, to be dropped, and taken up, and trifled with, as the incon-
 stant humour took him. When he grew weary, I grew weary. As his
 fancy died out, I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had,
 than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for liis wife.
 We fell away from one another without a word. Perhaps you saw it,
 and were not sorry. Since then, I have been a mere disfigured piece of
 furniture between yon both; having no eyes, no ears, no feelings, no
 remembrances. Moan ? Moan for what you made him ; not for your love.
 I tell you that the time was, when I loved him better than yon ever did ! "
    She stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare, and
the set face ; and softened no more, when the moaning was repeated, than
if the face had been a picture.
    " Miss Dartle," said I, " if you can be so obdurate as not to feel for
this afflicted m o t h e r "
    " Who feels for me? " she sharply retorted. " She has sown this.
 Let her moan for the harvest that she reaps to-day ! "
    "And if his faults -"         I began.
    "Faults ! " she cried, bursting into passionate tears. " Who dares
malign him? He had a soul worth millions of the friends to whom he
stooped ! ''
    " No one can have loved him better, no one can hold him in dearer
remembrance, than I," I replied. " I meant to say, if you have no compas-
sion for his mother; or if his faults-you have been bitter on them -"
    " I t 'S false," she cried, tearing her black hair ; " I loved hiin ! "

    " - cannot," I went on, " be banished from your remembrance, in such

an hour; look at that figure, even as one you have never seen before,
and render it some help ! "
    All this time, the figure was unchanged, and looked unchangeable.
Motionless, rigid, staring; moaning in the same dumb way from time to
time, with the same helpless motion of the head; but giving no other
sign of life. Miss Dastle suddenly kneeled down before it, and began to
loosen the dress.
    " il curse upon you ! " she said, looking round at me, with a mingled
expression of rage and grief.         I t was in an evil hour that you ever came
here ! A curse upon you ! Go ! "
    After passing out of the room, I hurried back to ring the bell, the sooner
to alarm the servants. She had then taken the impassive figure in her
arms, and, still upon her knees, was weeping over it, kissing it, calling to

it, rocking i t to and fro upon her bosom like a child, and trying every
tender means to rouse the dormant senses. No longer afraid of leaving
her, I noiselessly turned back again; and alarmed the house as I
went out.
    Later in the day, I returned, and we laid him in his mother's room.
She was just the same, they told me ; Miss Dartle never left her; doctors
were in attendance, many things had been tried ; but she lay like a statue,
except for the low sound now and then.
    I went through the dreary house, and darkened the windows. The
windows of the chamber where he lay, I darkened last. I lifted up the
leaden hand, and held it to my heart ; and all the world seemed death and
silence, broken only by his mother's moaning.




                            CHAPTER LVII.
                              THE EMIGRANTS.

   ONE thing more, I had to do, before yielding myself to the shock of
these emotions. I t was, to conceal what had occurred, from those who
were going away; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance.
I n this, no time was to be lost.
   I took Mr. Micawber aside that same night, and confided to him the
task of standing between Mr. Peggotty and intelligence of the late catas-
trophe. He zealously undertook to do so, and to intercept any newspaper
through which it might, without such precautions, reach him.
   " If it penetrates to him, sir," said Mr. Nicawber, striking himself on

the breast, " it shall first pass through this body ! "
    Mr. Micawber, I must observe, in his adaptation of himself to a new state
of society, had acquired a bold buccaneering air, not absolutely lawless,
but defensive and prompt. One might have supposed him a child of the
wildenles~,long accustomed to live out of the confines of civilisation, and
about to return to his native wilds.
   H e had provided himself, among other things, with a complete suit of
oil-skin, and a straw-hat with a very low crown, pitched or caulked on the
outside. I n this rough clothing, with a common mariner's telescope
under his arm, and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as
loolring out for dirty weather, he was far more nautical, after his manner,
than Mr. Peggotty. His whole family, if I may so express it, were cleared
for action. I found Mrs. Micawber in the closest and most uncompro-
mising of bonnets, made fast ~ ~ n dthee r chin ; and in a shawl which tied her
up (as I had been tied up, when niy aunt first received me) like a bundle,
and was secured behind at the waist, in a strong knot. Miss Micawber
I found made snug for stormy weather, in the same manner; with nothing
superfluous about her. Master Micawber was hardly visible in a Guernsey
570           THE PERSONAL HISTOBY AND EXPERIENCE

shirt, and the shaggiest suit of slops I ever saw ; and the children were
done up, like preserved meats, in impervious cases. Both Mr. Micawber
and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely turned back at the wrists, as
being ready to lend a hand in any direction, and to " tumble up," or sing
out, " Yeo-Heave-Yeo          ! " on the shortest notice.
   Thus Traddles and I found ihem at nightfall, assembled on the wooden
steps, at that time known as Hungerford Stairs, watching the departure
of a boat with some of their property on board. I had told Traddles of
the terrible event, and it had greatly shocked him; but there could
be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret, and he had come to
help me in this last service. I t was here that I took Mr. Micawber aside,
and received his promise.
   The Micawber family were lodged in a little, dirty, tumble-down public-
house, which in those days was close to the stairs, and whose protruding
wooden rooms overhung the river. The family, as emigrants, being objects
of some interest in and about Hungerford, attracted so many beholders,
that we mere glad to take refuge in their room. I t was one of the wooden
chambers up-stairs, with the tide flowing underneath. My aunt and Agnes
were there, busily making some little extra comforts, in the way of dress,
for the children. Peggotty was quietly assisting, with the old insensible
work-box, yard measure, and bit of wax-candle before her, that had now
outlived so much.
   I t was not easy to answer her inquiries ; still less to whisper Mr. Peg-
gotty, when Mr. Micawber brought him in, that I had given the letter,
and all was well. But I did both, and made them happy. If I showed
any trace of what I felt, my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it.
    " And when does the ship sail, Mr. Micawber ?" asked my aunt.
    Mr. Micawber considered it necessary to prepare either my aunt or his
wife, by degrees, and said, sooner than he had expected yesterday.
    " The boat brought you word, I suppose ? " said my aunt.
    '' I t did, nia'am," he returned.
    " Well ? " said my aunt.      " And she sails-''

    " Madam," he replied, " I am informed that we must positively be on
board before seven to-morrow morning."
    " EIeyday ! " said my aunt, "that 'S soon. I s it a sea-going fact, Mr.
Peggotty P "
    '"Tis so, ma'am. She'll drop down the river with that theer tide.
If Mas'r Davy and my sister comes aboard at Gravesen', arternoon o' next
 day, they'll see the last on us."
    "And that we shall do," said I, "be sure ! "
    "Until then, and until we are at sea," observed Mr. lficawber, with a
glance of intelligence at me, " Mr. Peggotty and myself will constantly
keep a double look-out together, on our goods and chattels. Emma, my
love," said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat in his magnificent way,
 "my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles is so obliging as to solicit, in my ear,
that he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients necessary to
the composition of a moderate portion of that Beverage which is peculiarly
 associated, in our minds, with the Roast Beef of old England. I allude
to-in short, Punch. Under ordinary circnmstances, I should scruple to
 entreat the indulgence of Miss Trotwood and Miss Wickfield, but -"

   " I can only say for myself," said my aunt, "that I will drink all
happiness and success to you, Mr. Micawber, with the utmost pleasure."
   "And I too ! " said Agnes, with a smile.
   Mr. Bficawber immediately descended to the bar, where he appeared to
be quite at home; and in due time returned with a steaming jug. I
could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own
clasp-knife, which, as became the knife of a practical settler, was about a
foot long; and which he wiped, not wholly without ostentation, on the
sleeve of his coat. Mrs. Micawber and the two elder members of the
family I now found to be provided with similar formidable instruments,
while every child had its own wooden spoon attached to its body by a
strong line. I n a similar anticipation of life afloat, and in the Bush, ;\fr.
Micawber, instead of helping Mrs. Micawber and his eldest son and
daughter to punch, in wine-glasses, which he might easily have done, for
there was a shelf-full in the room, served it out to then in a series of
villainous little tin pots ; and I never saw hiin enjoy anything so much as
drinking out of his own particular pint pot, and putting it in his pocket
at the close of the evening.
   " The luxuries of the old country," said Mr. Micawber, with an intense

satisfaction in their renouncement, "we abandon. The denizens of the
forest cannot, of course, expect to participate in the refinements of the
land of the Free."
   Here, a boy came in to say that Mr. Micawber was wanted down-stairs.
   " 1have a presentiment," said Mrs. Micawber, setting down her tin pot,
"that it is a member of my family ! "
   "If so, my deal;" observed Mr. Micawber, with his usual suddenness
of warmth on that subject, as the member of your family-whoever he,
she, or it, may be-has kept us waiting for a considerable period, perhaps
the Member may now wait nzy convenience."
   "Micawber," said his wife, in a low tone, " at such a time as this-"
   " ' I t is not meet,' " said Mr. Micawber, rising, " 'that every nice offence
should bear its comment ! ' Emma, I stand reproved."
   " The loss, Micawber," observed his wife, " has been my family's, not

yours. If my family are at length sensible of the deprivation to which
their own conduct has, in the past, exposed them, and now desire to
extend the hand of fellowship, let it not be repulsed."
   " My dear," he returned, " so be it ! "
   " If not for their sakes ; for mine, Micawber," said his wife.
   " Emma," he returned, " that view of the question is, at such a moment,
irresistible. I cannot, even now, distinctly pledge myself to fall upon your
family's neck; but the member of your family, who is now in attendance,
shall have no genial warmth frozen by me."
   Mr. Micawber withdrew, and was absent some little time ; in the course
of which Mrs. Micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension that
words might have arisen between him and the Member. At length the
same boy re-appeared, and presented me with a note written in pencil,
and headed, in a legal manner, " Ileep v. Micawber." Prom this docn-
ment, I learned that Mr. Micawber, being again arrested, was in a final
paroxysm of despair ; and that he begged me to send him his knife and pint
pot, by bearer, as they might prove serviceable during the brief remainder
512           T H E PERSONAL   HISTORY AND E X P E R I E N C E

 of his existence, in jail. He also requested, as a last act of friendship,
that I would see his family to the Parish Workhouse, and forget that such
a Being ever lived.
    Of course I answered this note by going down with the boy to pay the
money, where I found Mr. Nicawber sitting in a corner, looking darkly at
the Sheriff's Officer who had effected the capture. On his release, he
embraced me with the utmost fervor ; and made an entry of the trans-
action in his pocket-book-being       very particular, I recollect, about a
halfpenny I inadvertently omitted from my statement of the total.
   This momentons pocket-book was a timely reminder to him of another
transaction. On our return to the room upstairs (where he accounted
for his absence by saying that it had been occasioned by circumstances
over which he hacl no control), he took out of it a large sheet of paper,
folded small, and quite covered with long sums, carefully worked.
From the glimpse I had of them, I should say that I never saw such
sums out of a school cyphering-book. These, it seemed, were calculations
of compound interest on what he called "the principal amount of forty-
one, ten, eleven and a half," for various periods. After a careful consi-
deration of these, and an elaborate estimate of his resources, he had
come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount
with compound interest to two years, fifteen calendar months, and
fourteen days, from that date. For this he had drawn a note of-hand
with great neatness, which he handed over to Traddles on the spot, a
discharge of his debt in full (as between man and man), with many
acknowvledgments.
   " I have still a presentiment," said Mrs. Micawbel;    pensively shaking
her head, " that my family will appear on board, before we finally
depart."
   Mr. Micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too, but
he put it in his tin pot and swallowed it.
   " I f you have any opportunity of sending letters home, on your pas-
sage, Mrs. Micawber," said my aunt, " you must let us hear from you,
you know."
   " My dear Miss Trotwood," she replied, " I shall only be too happy to
think that anyone expects to hear from us. I shall not fail to correspond.
Mr. Copperfield, 1trust, as an old and familiar friend, will not object to
receive occasional intelligence, himself, from one who knew him when the
twins were yet unconscious ? "
   I said that I should hope to hear, whenever she had an opportunity of
writing.
   " Please IIeaven, there will be many such opportunities," said Mr.
Micawber. " The ocean, in these times, is a perfect fleet of ships ; and
we can hardly fail to encounter many, in running over. It is merely
crossing," said Mr. Micawber, trifling with his eye-glass, " merely cross-
ing. The distance is quite imaginary."
   I think, now, how odd it was, but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber,
that, when he went from London to Canterbury, he should have talked as
if he were going to the farthest limits of the earth; and, when he went
from England to Australia, as if he were going for a little trip across the
channel.
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          573
    " On the voyage, I shall endeavour," said Mr. Micawber, "occasionally
 to spin them a yarn; and the melody of my son TVilkins will, I trust, be
acceptable at the galley-fire. When Mrs. Micawber has her sea-legs 011-
an expression in which I hope there is no conventional impropriety-she
will give them, I dare say, Little Tafflin. Porpoises and dolphins, I
believe, will be frequently observed athwart our Bows ; and, either on the
Starboard or the Larboard Quarter, objects of interest will be continually
descried. I n short," said Mr. Micawber, with the old genteel air, " the
probability is, all will be found so exciting, alow and aloft, that when
the look-out, stationed in the main-top, cries Land-ho ! we shall be very
considerably astonished ! "
    With that he flourished off the contents of his little tin pot, as if he
had made the voyage, and had passed a first-class examination before the
highest naval authorities.
    "What I chiefly hope, my dear Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber,
 "is, that in some branches of our family we may live again in the old
country. Do not frown, Micawber! I do not now refcr to my own
family, but to our childrens' children. However vigorous the sapling,"
said Mrs. Micawber, shaking her head, " 1cannot forget the parent-tree ;
and when our race attains to eminence and fortune, I own I should wish
that fortune to flow into the coffers of Britannia."
    " My dear," said Mr. Micawber, " Britannia must take her chance. I
am bound to say that she has never done much for me, and that I have
no particular wish upon the subject."
    '' Micawber," returned Mrs. Micawber, " there, you are wrong. You
are going out, Micawber, to this distant clime, to strengthen, not to
weaken, the connexion between yourself and Albion."
    " The connexion in question, my love," rejoined Mr. Micawber, " has
not laid me, I repeat, under that load of personal obligation, that I am
at all sensitive as to the formation of another connexion."
    " Micawber," returned Mrs. Micawber.        " There, I again say, you are

wrong. You do not know your power, Micawber. I t is that which will
strengthen, even in this step you are about to take, the connexion between
yourself and Albion."
    Mr. Micawber sat in his elbow-chair, with his eyebrows raised; half
receiving and half repudiating Mrs. Micawber's views as they were stated,
but very sensible of their foresight.
    "My dear Mr. Copperfield," said Mrs. Micawber, '' 1 wish Bfr.
Micawber to feel his position. I t appears to me highly important that
Mr. Micawber should, from the hour of his embarkation, feel his position.
Your old knowledge of me, my dear Mr. Copperfield, will have told you
that I have not the sanguine disposition of Mr. Micawber. My disposi-
tion is, if I Inay say so, eminently practical. I know that this is a long
voyage. I know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences.
I cannot shut my eyes to those facts. But, I also know what Mr.
Micawber is. I know the latent power of Mr. Micawber. And therefore I
consider it vitally important that Mr. Micawber s h o ~ ~feel
                                                           l d his position."
    "My love," he observed, " perhaps you will allow me to remark that
it is barely possible that I do fie1 my position at the present moment."
    " I think not, Micawber," she rejoined. "Not fully. My dear
574           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 Mr. Copperfield, Mr. Micawber's is not a common case. &Er. Micawber is
 going to a distant country, expressly in order that he may be fully under-
 stood and appreciated for the first time. I wish Mr. Micawber to take
 his stand upon that vessel's prow, and firmly say ' This country I am come
 to conquer! Have you honours? Have you riches? Have you posts of
 profitable pecuniary emolument? Let them be brought forward. They
are mine ! ' "
    Mr. Micawber,
  . .         ..
                    glancing at us all, seemed to think there was a good
 deal in this ~dea.
    "I wish Mr. Micawber, if I make myself understood," said Mrs.
 Micawber, in her argumentative tone, " t o be the Czsar of his own
 fortunes. That, my dear Mr Copperfield, appears to me to be his true
 position. Prom the first moment of this voyage, I wish Mr. Micawber to
 stand upon that vessel's prow and say, 'Enough of delay: enough of
 disappointment : enough of limited means. That was in the old country.
This is the new. Produce your reparation. Bring it forward ! ' "
    Mr. Micawber folded his arms, in a resolute manner, as if he were then
stationed on the figure-head.
    " And doing that," said Mrs. Micawber, " -feeling      his position-am I
not right in saying that Mr. Micawber will strengthen, and not weaken,
his connexiou with Britain? An important public character arising in
that hemisphere, shall I be told that its influence will not be felt at
home? Can I be so weak as to imagine that Mr. Micawber, wielding the
rod of talent and of power in Australia, will be nothing in England? I
am but a woman; but I should be unworthy of myself, and of my papa, if
I were guilty of such absurd weakness."
    Mrs. Micawber's conviction that her arguments were unanswerable,
gave a moral elevation to her tone which I think I had never heard
Fn it before.
    " And therefore it is," said Mrs. Micawber, "that I the more wish, that,

at a future period, we may live again on the parent soil. Mr. Micawber
may be-I cannot disguise from myself that the probability is,Mr. Micawber
will be-a page of History; and he ought then to be represented in the
country which gave him birth, and did not give him employment ! "
    " My love," observed Mr. Micawber, "it is impossible for me not to be

touched by yo~xraffection. I am always willing to defer to your good
sense. What will be-will be. Heaven forbid that I should gr~tdgemy
native country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated by our
descendants ! "
   " That 'S well," said my aunt, nodding towards Mr. Peggotty, "and I
drink my love to you all, and every blessing and success attend you ! "
   Mr. Peggotty put down the two children he had been nursing, one on
each knee, to join Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in drinking to all of us in
return; and when he and the Micawbers cordially shoolr hands as com-
rades, and his brown face brightened with a smile, I felt that he would make
his way, establish a good name, and be beloved, go where he would.
   Even the children were instructed, each to dip a wooden spoon into
Mr. Micawber's pot, and pledge us in its contents. When this was done,
my aunt and Agnes rose, and parted from the emigrants. I t was a
sorrowful farewell. They were all crying; the children hung about Agnes
                         OF DAVID COPPEXFIELD.                           575
to the last ; and we left poor Mrs. illicarvber in a very distressed con-
dition, sobbing and weeping by a dim candle, that must have made the
room look, from the river, like a miserable light-house.
    I went down again next morning to see that they were away. They
had departed, in a boat, as early as five o'clock. I t was a wonderful
instance to me of the gap such partings make, that although my associa-
tion of them with the tumble-down public-honse and the wooden stairs
dated only from last night, both seemed dreary and deserted, now that they
were gone.
    I n the afternoon of the next day, my old nurse and I went down to
Gravesend. We found the ship in the river, surrounded by a crowd of
boats ; a favourable wind blowing; the signal for sailing at her mast
head. I hired a boat directly, and we put off to her; and getting
through the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre, went
on board.
    Mr. Peggotty was waiting for us on deck. He told me that Mr. Mi-
cawber had just now been arrested again (and for the last time) at
the suit of Heep, and that, in compliance with a request I had made to
him, he had paid the money : which I repaid him. He then took 11s down
between decks; and there, any lingering fears I had of his having heard
any rumours of what had happened, were dispelled by Mr. Micawber's
coming out of the gloom, taking his arm with an air of friendship and
protection, and telling me that they had scarcely been asunder for a
moment, since the night before last.
    I t was such a strange scene to me, and so confined and dark, that, at
first, 1 could make out hardly anything; but, by degrees, it cleared, as my
 eyes became more accustomed to the gloom, and I seemed to stand in a
picture by OSTADE. Among the great beams, bulks, and ringbolts of
the ship, and the emigrant-berths, and chests, and bundles, and barrels,
and heaps of miscellaneous baggage-lighted up, here and there, by
dangling lanterns ; arid elsewhere by the yellow day-light straying down a
windsail or a hatchway-were crowded groups of people, making new
 friendships, taking leave of one another, talking, laughing, crying, eating
 and drinking ; some, already settled down into the possession of their few
 feet of space, with their little households arranged, and tiny children estab-
 lished on stools, or in dwarf elbow-chairs ; others, despairing of a resting-
 place, and wandering disconsolately. Prom babies who had but a week or
 two of life behind them, to crooked old men and women who seemed to
 have but a week or two of life before them; and from ploughmen bodily
 carrying out soil of England on their boots, to smiths taking away
 samples of its soot and smoke upon their skins; every age and occupation
 appeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the 'tween decks.
    As my eye glanced round this place, I thought I saw sitting, by an open
 port, with one of the Micawber children near her, a figure like Emily's ;
 it first attracted my attention, by another figure parting from it with a
 kiss; and as it glided calmly away through the disorder, reminding me
 of-Agnes ! But in the rapid motion and confusion, and in the unsettle-
 ment of my own thoughts, I lost it again; and only knew that the time
 was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship; that
 my nurse tvas crying on a chest beside me; and that Mrs. Gummidge,
 576            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

  assistcd by some younger stooping woman in black, was busily arranging
  Mr. Peggotty's goods.
     " Is there any last wured, Mas'r Davy ? "     said he. 'l I s there any one
  forgotten thing afore we parts ? "
     " One thing ! " said I.   " Martha ! "
     He touched the younger woman I have mentioned on the shoulder, and
  Martha stood before me.
     " Heaven bless you, you good man! " cried I.         "You take her with
  you! "
     She answered for him, with a burst of tears. I could speak no more, at
  that time, but I wrung his hand; and if ever I have loved and honored
  any man, I loved and honored that man in my soul.
     The ship was clearing fast of strangers. The greatest trial that I had,
 remained. I told him what the noble spirit that was gone, had given me
 in charge to say at parting. I t moved him deeply. Rut when he charged
 me, in return, with many messages of affection and regret for those deaf
 ears, he moved me more.
     The time was come. I embraced him, took my weeping nurse upon my
 arm, and hurried away. On deck, I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber.
 She was looking distractedly about for her family, ever1 then ; and her last
 words to me were, that she never would desert Mr. Micawber.
    VITewent over the side into our boat, and lay at a little distance to see
 the ship wafted on her course. I t was then calm, radiant sunset. She
 lay between us, and the red light; and every taper line and spar was
 visible against the glow. A sight at once so beautiful, so mournful, and
 so hopeful, as the glorious ship, lying, still, on the flushed water, with all
 the life on board her crowded at the bulwarks, and there clustering, for a
 moment, bare-headed and silent, I never saw.
    Silent, only for a moment. As the sails rose to the wind, and the ship
 began to move, there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers,
 which those on board took up, and echoed back, and which were echoed
 and re-echoed. My heart burst out when I heard the sound, and beheld
the waving of the hats and handkerchiefs-and then I saw her !
    Then, I saw her, at her uncle's side, and trembling on his shoulder. H e
pointed to us with an eager hand ; and she saw us, and waved her last good-
bye to me. Aye, Emily, beautiful and drooping, cling to him with the
utmost trust of thy bruised heart; for he has clung to thee, with all the
might of his great love !
    Surrounded by the rosy light, and standing high upon the deck, apart
together, she clinging to him, and he holding her, they solemnly passed
away. The night had fallen on the Kentish hills when we were rowed
ashore-and fallen darkly upon me.

         IMPROVED TRANSPARENT TRACING PAPER,
    Warranted of the very best material.    Samples will be sent free, upon a ~ l i c a t i o n .
   The following extracts from the "Art Union," and "Magazine of Science," will be sufficient
guarantee of the excellent quality of these papers, and the great celebrity to which they have attained :
    Art Union.-"Messrs. Waterlow and Sons' Tracing Paper is certainly the best we have ever tried, being per-
fectly transparent, though sufficientlythick for all practical purposes, and perfectly free from that oiliness we
generally meet with in paper of a similar description, taking the ink as readily as ordinary writing paper. I t
must be invaluable to all who require the use of such an article!'
    Magazine of Science.-" To those very numerous classes of the public-artists, architects,engineers, map-makers
pattern-drawers-indeed to all who, whether professionallyor otherwise, have occasion to employ tracingpape~
we would, with earnestness, urge the extreme worth and merits of that manufactured by Messrs. Waterlow and
Sons. In happy contrast to the paper of a like nature, too frequently to be met with, theirs is entirely devoid of
all nasty, unclean greasiness; it is thoroughly transparent, and can be traced over either by the pencil, or-a great
desideratum-by pen and ink. Assuredly this is a very admirable article."

   The increasing demand for these Presses, and the great satisfaction which they have universally
given, have induced us to manufacture a large stork of the most useful sizes; we are therefore
enabled to offer them at much lower prices than heretofore ; the large sale which they have met with
has convinced us of the impolicy of endeavouring to maintain the old and extravagant scale of prices
charged at a time when it was the exception, instead of as at present the rule, for every Counting-
house or Gentleman's Library to be furnished witli a Copying Machine. These Machines, although
lower i n price than those o f a n y other manufacturer, are all warranted, and will be immediately
exchanged, or the money returned, if any fault is discovered.

                                This JOURNAL      is distinguished from purely scientific and
                          literary periodicals by partaking of the character of both. I n
                          the belief that the heart needs to be educated to the full as
                          much as the head, the constant aim has heen t o appeal to the
                          feelings as well as to the intellect. Prominence is given to none
                          but the higher and tenderer feelings of humanity.
                              The past numbers contain many contributions by long-
                          established Writers-Tales, Poetry, and Essays-all nearly
                          concerning the happiness and prosperity of the People.

                          provided, fitted for the pure minds and quick perceptions of
                          Childhood; and "Diamond Dust," consisting of quaint, witty,

              DANIEL LAMBERT'S SUIT.
SOMEWHERE      in Lincolnshire, no matter where-        A wondrous change in trade has come t o pass
(For that, In fact, IS nelther here nor there,)         Since Danlel Lambert stood before hrs glass.
I saw what I had never seen before-                     Monopoly, since Danlel wore his clothes
The very snlt which Danlel Lambert wore:                Has heen deprlved of that by which he rise.
And I confess that ~ t enormous
                         s         slze                 MOSESand SON,slnce then, have heen dlsplay'd
Was such as made me open both my eyes.                  As hold reformers in the sphere of trade:
I n fact, as long as my inspection lasted,              What would huge Daulel say, lf 11vlng now !
I stood and stared, completely flabbergasted.           And what surprise would l ~ fh18t lofty brow,
" Dear me, (I thought,) the celebrated Dan              If he could see what Mosss' famed Depat,
Must, sure, have heen a most prod~giousman!"            In all ~ t various
                                                                   s       articles could show I
The glant suit of whlch I made inspect~on               The present autumn dress, could he but see.
Brought MOSES'warehouse to my recollection.             Would please huge Daniel, as it pleases me.
The famed " Gol~athgarments" I survey'd,                Nor would the g ~ a n rue
                                                                               t h18 vlslt paid
And thought of what ~mprovementshad been made,          To MOSES'mart-the @ant of the trade.

COPPERFIELD ADVERTISER.
                ROYAL BANK BUILDINGS,
 LIVERPOOL,                September, 1850.
 I n September, 1840-We       Opened a department for the
          supplying of Families with Tea and Cofee-upon a
          principle calculated to u.ord the greatest advantage
          i n Price-with every security as to Quality.
 WHEN QUALITY is thus made the primary consideration
      -and     Price is fixed upon strictly economical
      principles-we were confident that our interest-as
      involved in the question of Profit-would   be fully
      secured by an increasing demand, which has been,
      and must be, the result of such a system-so
      obviously based.
 THE CONSTAATT care and exact; judgement exercised i n
            our method of selection and classification of
            qualities-have  been appreciated, and proved by
            the continually increasing extent of the FAMILY
            TRADE-in connection with our Establishment.
WE CANNOT refrain from directing the attention of
     Family Purchasers, to the present anomalous state
     of the-TEA MARKET-V~Z.
THE FIRSTCOST o f good and choice kinds is,-at         present,-unusually
    reasonable, at the same time, there is an increasing demand for the
    commonest BLACKTEA. This indicates that-CHEAPNESS-being           more
    regarded b y many Dealers than QUALITY-Disappointment is the
    necessary consequence, t o FAiCfILIhX whose supplies are derived from
    parties not possessing the requisite advantages in SELECTION and
    PURCHASE.

               Entrance up the Steps-leading             to the BANIC.

NOTE.-Liverpool       with its Docks, stands eminently advantageous for the
    Importing of Tea. Its superior Shipping Trade, having Docks covering
    upwards of 250 Statute Acres-with more than 20 miles of Quay space, a n
    amount of accommodation to be found in no other Port i a the World.
The Low Rates of Shipping Charges and the great facility for Dispatch,-have
    already secured to the Port of Liverpool nearly the whole of the Export
    Trade to China.

   H E success of" THELADIES'COMPANION,'.
T                                              whicl~has justified the belief that a field for such a
     periodical existed, has also encouraged its projectors to double diligence, with a view of
rendering their miscellany increasingly valuable by its vigour and variety, no less than attractive
by its refinement.
   New arrangements have been entered into, for the purpose of presenting in an improved form
the many important movements now making in the cause of Female Echcation and Association.
-It is the Editor's desire, too, to increase the importance of the literary criticism of the paper ;
selecting, week by week, such books only as befit a Lady's Library.-Characters and biographies
of Distinguished Women will be presented from time to time.-The          co-operation of some among
our female writers most distinguished in imaginative literature has been secured, in addition
to many of those who have already contributed.-In Art, besides furnishing guidance and
inforination, especially referring to the female artist, it is intended more largely than heretofore
to consider the intellectual pleasure of the amateur.
   While, however, Philosophy, Literature, Science, Imagination, Art, and Manners, will be in
turn treated, it is hoped, with increasing spirit,-a, ' l LADIES'COMPANION,"   to merit such compa-
nionship, must also hold up the Glass of Fashion," and keep open a Board of all manner
of dainty and ingenious works. Here, too, arrangements of the first importance have been
made, and here a name carries its own authority and recommendation. The proprietors, therefore
announce with pleasure, that the valuable assistance of Mademoiselle DBVY,37, Grosvenor-street, is
give11 exclusively to " THE LADIES'COMPANION        ;" and that all the information concerning Dress
or Fashions, which appears in its columns, has either been directly communicated by that lady, o r
appears under her sanction. They may also state that the Iliust~.ations of this periodical a r e
under the superintendence of H. Noel Humphreys, Esq.

   " The last of the new periodicals claiming notice is one which we have before spoken of, but in which many
manifest recent improvements invite renewed and more cordial mention. The Ladies' Companion is now a very,
intelligent as well as pleasant miscellany with merits not at all common. It has stories well told, nice criticism-
poetry much above the average, anecdotes and comment apt and inviting to lady readers, pretty and piquant illnstra
tions, and in every department presents evidence of able superintendence, and of a full, ready, well-stored, well-
cultivated mind. No one who looks at the numbers for the last month or two will find this too large a measure of
praise, and among its other most recent attractions let us not omit to mention the commencement of a clever story by
Miss Jewsbury, ' The Sorrows of Gentility.' '"Examiner, October 5, 1850.

        KNICHT'S CYCLQPRDIA OF LONDONI.
     In the year 1844 was completed a Work o n "LONDON," edited by CHARLES    KNIGHT.which extended t o
 Six Large Volumes. I t is proposed to publish a digested abridgment of that Work, with every necessary

Seven Shillings. This new Work, issued a t this remarkable rate of cheapness, will contain upwards of Six
Hundred Pages of Text, and numerous Engravings.
     In 1851 there will be a gathering from all lands in this, the largest city of the world, whose inhabitants
are in intercourse-commercial, political, or religious-with almost the whole human race. We purposely
select this period for producing a full, compact, and cheap book on LONDON,    that will endeavour to combine
accuracy with amusement,-a Guide for the Visitor,-apermanent Volume in the National Library.

    "THE INDUSTRY     O F A L L NATIONS"is a large subject. The material products of that Industry will require
for their exhibition a Building whose area will be computed by acres, with Galleries whose length will be
measured by miles. The People are anxiously looking for information upon this great theme. Thecuriosity
and the emulation of the vast army of Workers in these kingdoms is slirred into more than common activity
by the preparations for the approaching INDUSTRIAL    GATHERING  FROI A L L LANDS. We propose t o meet this
popular desire for information in a manner that may convey the results. without the ostentation of science, at
uprice within the means of all readers. We propose to publish AN INDUSTRIAL CYCLOPADIA, which will

    THIS DICTIONARY     OF ARTS A N D INDWSTRY        will occupy somewhat more than half of the proposed work;
and will, i t is confidently hoped, be C O M P L E T E D A S A VOLUME OF REFERENCE   BY THE OPENING OF THE
EXHIBITION OF 1851. The Dictionary will be followed by the publication of

   A WEEKLY PAPER ON SOME SUBJECT                                                   OF     INDUSTRY.

 WRITINGS OF DOUGLAS JERROLD.
     Many of these remain in the piecemeal form in which they were
originally published, or lie scattered over the periodical literature of
the last fifteen years ; and as all of them, in a greater or less degree,
have achieved a popular reputation, it is hoped that their republication,
in a cheap and uniform edition, will be acceptable to the public.

  They will comprise--
          I. NOVELS.                 Ill. ESSAYS.
          II. TALES.                 IV. COMEDIES & DRAMAS.

and will probably extend to Six Volumes.

     The size adopted will be that of Mr. Dickens's cheap editions,
but the lines will extend across the page, instead of being in columns.

    The mode of publication will be in Weekly Numbers of sixteen
pages each ; in Monthly Parts ;and, finally, in Volumes.

    The price of each Number will be I t d . ; and the average of each
Volume will be about Twenty-four Numbers.

                           CHAPTER LVIII.
                                  ABSENCE.

    IT was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me, haunted by the
 ghosts of many hopes, of many dear remembrances, many errors, many
 unavailing sorrows and regrets.
    I went away from England ;not knowing, even then, how great the shock
 was, that I had to bear. I left all who were dear to me, and vrent away ;and
 believed that I had borne it, and it was past. As a man upon a field of
 battle will receive a mortal hurt, and scarcely know that he is struck, so I,
 when I was left alone with my undisciplined heart, had no conception of
 the wound with which it had to strive.
    The knowledge came upon me, not quickly, but little by little, and
 grain by grain. The desolate feeling with which I went abroad, deepened
 and widened hourly. At first it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow,
 wherein I could distinguish little else. By imperceptible degrees, it
became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost-love, friendship,
interest; of all that had been shattered-my first trust, my first afTection,
the whole airy castle of my life; of all that remained-a ruined blank and
waste, lying wide around me, unbroken, to the dark horizon.
   If my grief were selfish, 1did not know it to be so. I mourned for my
child-wife, taken from her blooming world, so young. I mourned for
him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands, as he
had won mine long ago. I mourned for the broken heart that had found
rest in the stormy sea; and for the wandering remnants of the simple
home, where I had heard the night-wind blowing, when I was a child.
   From the accumulated sadness into which I fell, I had at length no
hope of ever issuing again. I roamed from place to place, carrying my
burden with me everywhere. I felt its whole weight now ; and I drooped
beneath it, and 1 said in my heart that it could never be lightened.
   When this despondency was at its worst, I believed that I should die.
Sometimes, I thought that I would like to die at home; and actually
turned back on my road, that I might get there soon. At other times, I
passed on farther away, from city to city, seeking I know not what, and
trying to leave I know not what behind.
   I t is not in my power to retrace, one by one, all the weary phases of
distress of mind through which 1 passed. There are some dreams that
can only be imperfectly and vaguely described; and when I oblige myself
to look back on this time of my life, I seem to be recalling such a dream.
J see myself passing on among the novelties of foreign towns, palaces,
cathedrals, temples, pictures, castles, tombs, fantastic streets-the old
abiding places of History and Fansy-as a dreamer might; bearing my
painful load through all, and hardly conscious of the objects as they fade
                                                              P P
578          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

before me. Listlessness to everything, but brooding sorrow, was the night
that fell on my undisciplined heart. Let me look up from it-as at
last I did, thank Heaven !-and from its long, sad, wretched dream, to
dawn.
    For many months I travelled with this ever-darkening cloud upon my
mind. Some blind reasons that I had for not returning home-reasons
then struggling within me, vainly, for more distinct expression-kept me
on my pilgrimage. Sometimes, I had proceeded restlessly from place to
place, stopping nowhere ; sometimes, I had lingered long in one spot. I
had had no purpose, no sustaining soul within me, anywhere.
    I was in Switzerland. I had come out of Italy, over one of the great
passes of the Alps, and had since wandered with a guide among ihe bye-ways
of the mountains. If those awful solitudes had spoken to my heart, I did
not know it. I had found sublimity and wonder in the dread heights and
precipices, in the roaring torrents, and the wastes of ice and snow; but as
yet, they had taught me nothing else.
    I came, one evening before sunset, down into a valley, where I was to
rest. I n the course of my descent to it, by the winding track along the
mountain-side, from which I saw it shining far below, I think some long-
unwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity, some softening influence
awakened by its peace, inoved faintly in my breast. I remember pausing
once, with a kind of sorrow that was not all oppressive, not quite
despairing. I reinember almost hoping that some better change was
possible within me.
    I came into the valley, as the evening sun was shining on the remote
heights of snow, that closed it in, like eternal clouds. The bases of the
mountains forming the gorge in which the little village lay, were richly
green; and high above this gentler vegetation, grew forests of dark fir,
cleaving the wintry snow-drift, wedge-like, and stemming the avalanche.
Above these, were range upon range of craggy steeps, grey rock, bright
ice, and smooth verdure-specks of pasture, all gradually blending with the
crowning snow. Dotted here and there on the mountain's-side, each tiny
dot a home, were lonely wooden cottages, so dwarfed by the towering
heights that they appeared too small for toys. So did even the clnstered
village in the valley, with its wooden bridge across the stream, where
the stream tumbled over broken rocks, and roared away among the
trees. I n the quiet air, there was a sound of distant singing-shepherd
voices ; but, as one bright evening clond floated midway along the moun-
tain's-side, I could almost have believed it came from there, and was
not earthly music. All at once, in this serenity, great Nature spoke to
me; and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass, and
weep as I had not wept yet, since Dora died !
    I had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before,
 and had strolled out of the village to read them while my supper was
 making ready. Other packets had missed me, and I had received none for
 a long time. Beyond a line or two, to say that I was well, and had arrived
 at such a place, I had not had fortitude or constancy to write a letter
 since I left home.
     The packet was in my hand. I opened it, and read the writing of
 Agnes.
                         O F DAVID COPPERFIELD.                         579
     She was happy and useful, was prospering as she had hoped. That
   was all she told me of herself. The rest referred to me.
     She gave me no advice ; she urged no duty on me ; she only told me,
  in her own fervent manner, what her trust in me was. She knew (she
  mid) how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good. She knew
  how trial and emotion would exalt and strengthen it. She was sure that
 in my every purpose I should gain a firmer and a higher tendency, through
 the grief I had undergone. She, who so gloried in my fame, and so
 looked forward to its augmentation, well knew that I would labor on. She
 knew that in me, sorrow could not be weakness, but must be strength. As
 the endurance of my childish days had done its part to make me what I
 was, so greater calamities would nerve me on, to be yet better than I was ;
 and so, as they had taught me, would I teach others. She commended
 me to God, who had taken my innocent darling to His rest ; and in her
 sisterly affection cherished me always, and was always at my side go where
 I would; proud of what I had done, but infinitely prouder yet of what
 I was reserved to do.
    I put the letter in my breast, and thought what had I been an hour
 ago ! When I heard the voices die away, and saw the quiet evening cloud
 grow dim, and all the colors in the valley fade, and the golden snow upon
 the mountain tops become a remote part of the pale night sky, yet felt
 that the night was passing from my mind, and all its shadows clearing,
 there was no name for the love I bore her, dearer to me, henceforward,
than ever until then.
    I read her letter, many times. I wrote to her before I slept. I told
lier that I had been in sore need of her help; that without her I was
not, and I never had been, what she thought me; but, that she inspired
me to be that, and I would try.
    I did try. I n three months more, a year would have passed since the
beginning of my sorrow. I determined to make no resolutions until the
expiration of those three months, but to try. I lived in that valley, and its
neighbourhood, all the time.
    The three months gone, I resolved to remain away from home for some
time longer; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland, which was
growing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening; to resume my
pen; to work.
    I resorted humbly whither Agnes had commended me; I sought out
Nature, never sought in vain; and I admitted to my breast the human
interest I had lately shrunk from. I t was not long, before I had almost
as many friends in the valley as in Yarmouth ; and when I left it, before
the winter set in, for Geneva, and came back in the spring, their cordial
greetings had a homely sound to me, although they were not conveyed in
English words.
    I worked early and late, patiently and hard. I wrote a Story, with a
purpose growing, not remotely, out of my experience, and sent it to
Traddles, and he arranged for its publication very advantageously for me ;
and the tidings of my growing reputation began to reach me from travellers
whom I encountered by chance. After some rest and change, I fell to
work, in my old ardent way, on a new fancy, which took strong possession
of me. As I advanced in the execution of this task, I felt it more and

more, and roused my utmost energies to do it well. This was my third
work of fiction. I t was not half written, when, in an interval of rest, I
thought of returning home.
    For a long time, though studying and working patiently, I had accus-
tomed myself to robust exercise. My health, severely impaired when I left
England, was quite restored. I had seen much. I had been in many
countries, and I hope I had improved my store of knowledge.
    I have now recalled all that I think it needful to recal here, of this
term of absence-with one reservation. I have made it, thus far, with
no purpose of suppressing any of my thoughts ; for, as I have elsewhere
said, this narrative is my written memory. I have desired to keep the
most secret current of my mind apart, and to the last. I enter on
it now.
    I cannot so completely penetrate the mystery of my own heart, as to
know when I began to think that I might have set its earliest and brightest
hopes on Agnes. I cannot say at what stage of my grief it first became
 associated with the reflection, that, in my w a y ~ a r dboyhood, I had
thrown away the treasure of her love. I believe I may have heard some
whisper of that distant thought, in the old unhappy loss or want of
 something never to be realised, of which I had been sensible. But the
thought came into my mind as a new reproach and new regret, when I
 was left so sad and lonely in the world.
    If, at that time, I had been much with her, I should, in the weak-
 ness of my desolation, have betrayed this. I t was what I remotely
 dreaded when I was first impelled to stay away from England. I could
 not have borne to lose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection;
 yet, in that betrayal, I should have set a constraint between us hitherto
 unknown.
     I could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded
 me had grown up in my own free choice and course. That if she had
 ever loved me with another love-and I sometimes thought the time was
 when she might have done so-I had cast it away. I t was nothing, now,
 that I had accustomed myself to think of her, when we were both mere
 children, as one who was far removed from my wild fancies. I had
 bestowed my passionate tenderness upon another object; and what I
 might have done, I had not done; and what Agnes was to me, I and her
 own noble heart had made her.
     I n the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me, when I
 tried to get a better understanding of myself and be a better man, I did
 glance, through some indefinite probation, to a period when I might pos-
 sibly hope to cancel the mistaken past, and to be so blessed as to marry
 her. But, as time wore on, this shadowy prospect faded, and departed
 from me. If she had ever loved me, then, I should hold her the more
  sacred; remembering the confidences I had reposed in her, her knowledge
  of my errant heart, the sacrifice she must have made to be my friend and
  sister, and the victory she had won. If she had never lovecl me, could I
  believe that she would love me now?
     I had always felt my weakness, in comparison with her constancy and
  fortitude ; and now I felt it more and more. Whatever I might have been
  to her, or she to me, if I had been inore worthy of her long ago, I was
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           581
not now, and she was not. The time was past. I had let it go by, and
had deservedly lost her.
   That I suffered much in these contentions, that they filled me with
unhappiness and remorse, and yet that I had a sustaining sense that it
was required of me, in right and honor, to keep away from myself, with
shame, the thought of turning to the dear girl in the withering of my
hopes, from whom I had frivolously turned when they were bright and
fresh-which consideratioil was at the root of every thought I had con-
cerning her-is all equally true. I made no effort to conceal from myself,
now, that I loved her, that I was devoted to her; bnt I brought the
assurance home to myself, that it was now too late, and that our long-
subsisting relation must be undisturbed.
   I had thought, much and often, of my Dora's shadowing out to me
what might have happened, in those years that were destined not to try us ;
I had considered how the things that never happen, are often as much
realities to us, in their effects, as those that are accomplished. The very
years she spoke of, were realities now, for my correction ; and would have
been, one day, a little later perhaps, though we had parted in our earliest
folly. I endeavoured to convert what might have been between myself
and Agnes, into a means of making me more self-denying, more resolved,
more conscious of myself, and my defects and errors. Thus, through the
reflection that it might have been, I arrived at the conviction that it could
never be.
   These, with their perplexities and inconsistencies, were the shifting
quicksands of my mind, from the time of my departure to the time of
my return home, three years afterwards. Three years had elapsed since
the sailing of the emigrant ship; when, at that same hour of sunset, and
in the same place, I stood on the deck of the packet vessel that brought
me home, looking on the rosy water where I had seen the image of that
ship reflected.
   Three years. Long in the aggregate, though short as they went by.
And home was very dear to me, and Agnes too-but she was not mine-
she was never to be mine. She might have been, but that was past !
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                            CHAPTER LIX.
                                 RETURN.

    I LANDED in London on a wintry autumn evening. I t was dark ancl
raining, and I saw more fog and mud in a minute than I had seen in a
year. I walked from the Custom I-Iouse to the iblonument before I found
a coach; and although the very house-fronts, looking on the swollen
gutters, were like old friends to me, I could not but admit that they were
very dingy friends.
    I have often remarked-I suppose everybody has-that one's going
away from a familiar place, would seem to be the signal for change in it.
As I looked O L I ~ of the coach-window, and observed that an old house on
Fish-street Hill, which had stood untouched by painter, carpenter, or
bricklayer, for a century, had been pulled down in my absence ; and that
a neigl~bouringstreet, of time-honored insalubrity and inconvenience, was
being drained and widened; I half expected to find St. Paul's Cathedral
looking older.
   For some changes in the fortunes of my friends, I was prepared.
My aunt had long been re-established at Dover, and Traddles had begun
to get into some little practice at the Bar, in the very first term after
my departure. He had chambers in Gray's Inn, now; and had told me,
in his last letters, that he was not without hopes of being soon united to
the dearest girl in the world.
    They expected me home before Christmas; but had no idea of my
returning so soon. I had purposely niisled them, that I might have the
pleasure of taking them by surprise. And yet, I was perverse enough to
feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome, and rattling,
alone and silent, through the misty streets.
    The well-know11 shops, however, with their cheerful lights, did some-
thing for me; and when I alighted at the door of the Gray's Inn Coffee-
house, I had recovered my spirits. I t recalled, at first, that so-different
time when I had put up at the Golden Cross, and reminded me of the
changes that had come to pass since then ; but that was natural.
    "Do you know where Mr. Traddles lives in the Inn P " I asked the
waiter, as I warmed myself by the coffee-room fire.
    " I-Iolborn Court, sir. Number two."
    " Mr. Traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers, I believe? "
 said I.
    " Well, sir," returned the waiter, "probably he has, sir; but I am not

 aware of it myself'."
    This waiter, who was middle-aged and spare, looked for help to a
 waiter of more authority-a stout, potential old man, with a double-chin,
 in black breeches and stockings, who came out of a place like a church-
                        OF D.4VID   COPPERFIELD.                        583
warden's pew, at the end of the coffee-room, where he kept company with
a cash-box, a Directory, a Law-list, and other books and papers.
   " Mr. Traddles," said the spare waiter.    "Number two in the Court."
   The potential waiter waved him away, and turned, gravely, to me.
   "I was inquiring," said I, "whether Mr. Traddles at number two in the
Court, has not a rising reputation among the lawyers ? "
   "Never heard his nanie," said the wa~ter,in a rich husky voice.
   I felt quite apologetic for Traddles.
   "He's a young man, sure? " said the portentous waiter, fixing his
eyes severely on me. " How long has he been in the Inn?"
   "Not above three years," said I.
   The waiter, who I supposed had lived in his churcliwarden's pew for
forty years, could not pursue such an insignificant subject. He asked me
what I would have for dinner ?
   I felt I was in England again, and really was quite cast down on Trad-
dles's account. There seemed to be no hope for him. I meekly ordered
a bit of fish and a steak, and stood before the fire musing on his obscurity.
   As I followed the chief waiter with my eyes, I conld not help thinking
that the garden iil which he had gradually blown to be the flower he
was, was an arduous place to rise in. I t had such a prescriptive, stiff-
necked, long-established, solemn, elderly air. I glanced about the room,
which had had its sanded floor sanded, no doubt, in exactly the same
manner when the chief waiter was a boy-if he ever was a boy, which
appeared improbable; and at the shining tables, where I saw myself
reflected, in unruffled depths of old mahogany ; and at the lamps, without
a flaw in their trimming or cleaning; and at the comfortable green cur-
tains, with their pure brass rods, snugly enclosing the boxes ; and at the
two large coal fires, brightly burning; and at the rows of decanters, burly
as if with the consciousness of pipes of expensive old port wine below;
and both England, and ihe law, appeared to me to be very difficult indeed
to be taken by storm. I went up to my bed-room to change my wet
clothes; and the vast extent of that old wainscotted apartment (which
was over the archway leading to the Inn, I remember), and the sedate
immensity of the four-post bedstead, and the indomitable gravity of the
chests of drawers, all seemed to unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of
Traddles, or on any such daring youth. I came down again to my dinner;
and even the slow comfort of the meal, and the orderly silence of the
place-which was bare of guests, the Long Vacation not yet being over-
were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles, and his small hopes of a liveli-
hood for twenty years to come.
   I had seen nothing like this since I went away, and it quite dashed my
hopes for my friend. The chief waiter had had enough of me. Ile came
near me no more ;but devoted hi~ilselfto an old gentleman in long gaiters,
to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of
its own accord, for he gave no order. The second waiter informed me, in
a whisper, that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the
 Square, and worth a mint of moEey, which it was expected he would leave
to his laundress's daughter; likewise that it was rumoured that he had a
 service of plate in a bufeau, all tarnished witli lying by, though more than
one spoon and a fork had never get been beheld in his chambers by mortal
 584            T H E PERSONAL HISTORY       AND EXPERIENCE

  vision. By this time, I quite gave Traddles up for lost; and settled in my
  own mind that there was no hope for him.
     Being very anxious to see the dear old fellow, nevertheless, I despatched
  my dinner, in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in the opinion of
  the chief waiter, and hurried out by the back way. Number two in the
  Court was soon reached ; and an inscription on the door-post informing
 me that Mr. Traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top story, I
 ascended the staircase. A crazy old staircase I found it to be, feebly
 lighted on each landing by a club-headed little oil wick, dying away in a
 little dungeon of dirty glass.
     In the course of my stumbling up stairs, I fancied I heard a pleasant
 sound of laughter ; and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister, or
 attorney's clerk or barrister's clerk, but of two or three merry girls. Happen-
 ing, however, as I stopped to listen, to put my foot in a hole where the
 Honorable Society of Gray's Inn had left a plank deficient, I fell dowiz
 with some noise, and when I recovered my footing all was silent.
    Groping my way more carefully, for the rest of the journey, my heart
beat high when I found the outer door, which had MR. TRADDLES             painted
011 it, open. I knocked.         A considerable scuffling within ensued, but
nothing else. I therefore knocked again.
    A small sharp-looking lad, half-footboy and half-clerk, who was very
much out of breath, but who loolred at me as if he defied me to prove it
legally, presented himself.
    " I s Mr. Traddles within? " said I.
    " Yes, sir, but he 'S engaged."
    " I want to see him."

    After a moment's survey of me, the sharp-looking lad decided to let me
in ; and opening the door wider for that purpose, admitted me, first, into a
little closet of a hall, and next into a little sitting-room ; where I came
into the presence of my old friend (also out of breath), seated at a table,
and bending over papers.
    " Good God ! "      cried Traddles, looking up. " I t 'S Copperfield ! "
and rushed into my arms, where I held him tight.
    " All well, my dear Traddles ? "

    " All well, my dear, dear Copperfield, and nothing but good news ! "
    We cried with pleasure, both of us.
    " My dear fellow," said Traddles, rumpling his hair in his excitement,
which was a most unnecessary operation, "my dearest Copperfield, my
long-lost and most welcome friend, how glad I am to see you! How
brown you are ! How glad I am ! Upon my life ancl honor, I never was
so rejoiced, my beloved Copperfield, never ! "
    I was equally at a loss to express my emotions. I was quite unable to
speak, at first.
    " My dear fellow ! " said Traddles. "And grown so famous ! My
glorious Copperfield ! Good gracious me, when did you come, where have
you come from, what have you been doing? "
    Never pausing for an answer to anything he said, Traddles, who had
clapped me into an easy chair by the fire, all this time impetuously stirred
the fire with one hand, and pulled at my neck-kerchief with tlie other,
under some wild delusion that it was a great coat. Without putting

  down the poker, he now hugged me again ; aud I hugged him ; and, both
  laughing, and both wiping our eyes, we both sat down, and shook hands
 across the hearth.
     "To think," said Traddles, "that you should have been so nearly
  coming home as you must have been, my dear old boy, and not at the
  ceremony ! "
     "What ceremony, my dear Traddles? "
     "Good gracious me ! " cried Traddles, opening his eyes in his old way.
  "Didn't you get my last letter ? "
     " Certainly iiot, if it referred to any ceremony."
     " Why, my dear Copperfield," said Traddles, sticking his hair upright

 with both hands, and then putting his hands on my knees, " I am
 married ! "
    " Married ! " I cried 'o fully !
    " Lord bless me, ye; ?"said Traddles-" by the &rerend Horace-to
 Sophy-down in Devonshire. Why, my dear boy, she 'S behind the
 window curtain ! Look here ! "
    To my amazement, the dearest girl in the world came at that same
 instant, laughing and blushing, from her place of concealment. And a
 more cheerful, amiable, honest, happy, bright-looking bride, I believe (as
I could not help saying on the spot) the world never saw. I kissed her
as an old acquaintance should, and wished them joy with all my might of
heart.
    "Dear me," said Traddles, " what a delightful re-union this is ! You
arc so extremely brown, my dear Copperfield! God bless my soul, how
happy I am ! "
    " And so am I," said I.

    " And I am sure I am ! " said the blushing and laughing Sophy.

    "We are all as happy as possible ! " said Traddles. " Even the girls
are happy. Dear me, I declare I forgot them ! "
    " Forgot ? " said I.
    " The girls," said Traddles.       " Sophy's sisters. They are staying with
us. They have come to have a peep at London. The fact is, when-
was it you that tumbled up stairs, Copperfield ? "
    " It was," said I, laughing.

    " Well then, when you tumbled up stairs," said Traddles, " I was romping

with the girls. I n point of fact, we were playing at Puss in the Corner.
But as that wouldn't do in Westminster Hall, and as it wouldn't look
quite professional if they were seen by a client, they decamped. And they
are now-listening, I have no doubt," said Traddles, glancing at the door
of another room.
    " I am sorry," said I, laughing afresh, "to have occasioned such a
dispersion."
    " Upon my word," rejoined Traddles, greatly delighted, "if you had

seen them running away, and running back again, after you had knocked,
to pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair, and going on n
the maddest manner, you wouldn't have said so. My love, will you fetch
the girls ? "
    Sophy tripped away, and we heard her received in the adjoining room
with a peal of laughter.
               THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

     " Really musical, isn't it, my dear Copperfield ? " said Traddles.  " I t 's
very agreeable to hear. I t quite lights up these old rooms. To an
unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life, you know,
it 'S positively delicious. I t 'S charming. Poor things, they have had a
great loss in Sophy-who, I do assure you, Copperfield, is, and ever was,
the dearest girl !-and it gratifies me beyond expression to find them in
such good spirits. The society of girls is a very delightfill thing,
Copperfield. I t 'S not professional, but it 'S very delightful."
     Observing that he slightly faltered, and comprehending that in the
goodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he
had said, I expressed my concurrence with a heartiness that evidently
relieved and pleased him greatly.
     " But then," said Traddles, " our domestic arrangements are, to say

the truth, quite unprofessional altogether, my dear Copperfield. Even
Sophy's being here, is unprofessional. And we have no other place of
abode. We have put to sea in a cockboat, but we are quite prepared
to rough it. And Sophy 'S an extraordinary manager ! You 'l1 be sur-
prised how those girls are stowed away. I am sure I hardly know how
it 'S done."
    " Are many of the young ladies with you? " I inquired.

    " The eldest, the Beauty is here," said Traddles, in a low confidential

voice, " Caroline. And Sarah 'S here-the one I mentioned to you
as having something the matter with her spine, you know. Immensely
better! And the two youngest that Sophy educated are with us. And
Louisa 'S here."
    " Indeed ! " cried I.
    " Yes," said Traddles. " NOWthe whole set-I mean the chambers-
is only three rooms ; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonder-
ful way, and they sleep as comfortably as possible. Three in that room,"
said Traddles, pointing. " Two in that."
    I could not help glancing round, in search of the accommodation
remaining for Nr. and Mrs. Traddles. Traddles understood me.
     " Well ! " said Traddles, "we are prepared to rough it, as I said just

now; and we did improvise a bed last week, upon the floor here. But
there 'S a little room in the roof-a very nice room, when you 're up there
-which Sophy papered herself; to surprise me; and that 'S our room at
present. I t 'S a capital little gipsey sort of place. There 'S quite a view
from it."
     " And you are happily married at last, my dear Traddles! " said I.

 " How rejoiced I am ! "
     " Thank you, my dear Copperfield," said Traddles, as we shook hands
once more. "Yes, I am as happy as it 'S possible to be. There 'S your old
friend, you see," said Traddles, nodding triumphantly at the flower-pot
 and stand; "and there 'S the table with the marble top ! All the other
 furniture is plain and serviceable, you perceive. And as to plate, Lord
 bless you, we haven't so much as a tea-spoon."
     " All to be earned? " said I, cheerf~llly.

     " Exactly so," replied Traddles, " all to be earned.     Of course we have
 something in the shape of tea-spoons, because we stir our tea. But
 they 're Britannia metal."

   "  The silver will be the brighter when it comes," said I.
   " The very thing we say ! " cried Traddles.         " You see, my dear

 Copperfield," falling again into the low confidential tone, " after I had
 delivered my argument in DOE dem JIPESvemus WIGZELL,which did
 me great service with the profession, I went down into Devonshire, and
 had some serious conversation in private with the Reverend I-Iorace. I
 dwelt upon the fact that Sophy-who I do assure you, Copperfield, is the
dearest girl ! -"
   " I am certain she is ! " said I.

   " She is, indeed ! " rejoined Traddles. 'c But I am afraid I am wander-
ing from the subject. Did I mention the Reverend Horace ? "
   " You said that you dwelt upon the fact -"
   " True ! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long
period, and that Sophy, with the permission of her parents, was more
than content to take me-in short," said Traddles, with his old frank smile,
" on our present Britannia-metal footing. Very well. I then proposed
to the Reverend Horace-who is a most excellent clergyman, Copperfield,
and oughl to be a Bishop ; or at least ought to have enough to live upon,
without pinching himself-that if I could turn the corner, say of two
hundred and fifty pounds, in one year ; and could see my way pretty clearly
to that, or something better, next year; and could plamly furnish a little
place like this, besides ; then, and in that case, Sophy and I should be
united. I took the liberty of representing that we had been patient for a
good many years; and that the circumstance of Sophy's being extraor-
dinarily useful at home, ought not to operate, with her affectionate parents,
against her establishment in life-don't you see?"
   " Certainly it ought not,"   said I.
   " I am glad you think so, Copperfield," rejoined Traddles, " because,

without any imputation on the Reverend Horace, I do think parents,
and brothers, and so forth, are sometimes rather selfish in sucli cases.
Well ! I also pointed out, that my most earnest desire was, to be useful
to the family ; and that if I got on in the world, and anything should
happen to him-I refer to the Reverend Horace-"
   " I understand,"    said I.
   " -Or    to Mrs. Crewler-it mould be the utmost gratification of my
wishes, to be a parent to the girls. He replied in a most admirable manner,
exceedingly flattering to my feelings, and undertook to obtain the consent
of Mrs. Crewier to this arrangement. They had a dreadful time of it
with her. I t mounted from her legs into her chest, and then into her
head-"
   "What mounted ? " I asked.
   " Her grief,"   replied Traddles, with a serious look. "Her feelings
generally. As I mentioned on a former occasion, she is a very superior
woman, but has lost the use of her limbs. Whatever occurs to harass
her, usually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted to the
chest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded the whole system
in a most alarming manner. However, they brought her through it by
unremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday
six weeks. You have no idea what a Monster I felt, Copperfield, when
saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction ! Mrs.
588           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 Crewler couldn't see me before we left-couldn't forgive me, then, for
depriving her of her child-but she is a good creature, and has done so
since, I had a delightful letter from her, only this morning."
     "And in short, my dear friend," said I, "you feel as blest as you
 deserve to feel! "
     " Oh ! That 'S your partiality ! " laughed Traddles.      But, indeed, I
am in a most enviable state. I work hard, and read Law insatiably. I
get up at five every morning, and don't mind it at all. I hide tile girls in
the day-time, and make merry with them in the evening. And I assure
you I am quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday, which is the
day before the first day of Michaelmas Term. But here," said Traddles,
breaking off in his confidence, and speaking aloud, " are the girls ! Mr.
Copperfield, Miss Crewler-Miss Szah-Miss Louisa-Margaret                 and
Lucy ! "
    They were a perfect nest of roses ; they looked so wholesome and fresh.
They were all pretty, and Miss Caroline was very handsome; but there
was a loving, cheerful, fireside quality in Sopliy's bright looks, which was
better than that, and which assured me that my friend had chosen well.
We all sat round the fire ; while the sharp boy, who I now divined had lost
his breath in putting the papers out, cleared them away again, and pro-
duced the tea-things. After that, he retired for the night, shutting the
outer-door upon us with a bang. Mrs. Traddles, with perfect pleasure
and coniposure beaming from her household eyes, having made the tea,
then quietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire.
    She had seen Agnes, she told me while she was toasting. "Tom" had
taken her down into Kent for a wedding trip, and there she had seen my
aunt, too ; and both my aunt and Agnes were well, and they had all talked
of nothing but me. "Tom" had never had me out of his thoughts,
she really believed, all the time I had been away. "Tom " was the
authority for everything. "Tom" was evidently the idol of her life;
never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion; always to be
believed in, and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart, come
what might.
    The deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the Beauty,
pleased me very much. I don't know that I thought it very reasonable;
but I thought it very delightful, and essentially a part of their character.
If Traddles ever for an instant missed the teaspoons that werc still to be
won, I have no doubt it was when he handed the Beauty her tea. If his
sweet-tempered wife could have got up any self-assertion against any one,
I am satisfied it could only have been because she was the Beauty's sister.
A few slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner, which I
observed in the Beauty, were manifestly considered, by Traddles and
his wife, as her birthright and natural endowment. If she had been born
a Queen Bee, and they laboring Bees, they could not have been more
 satisfied of that.
    But their self-forgetfulness charmed me. Their pride in these girls,
 and their submission of themselves to all their whims, was the pleasantest
 little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see. If
 Traddles were addressed as " a darling," once in the course of that
 evening ; and besought to bring something here, or carry something there,
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            589
 or take something up, or put something down, or find something, or fetch
 something; he was so addressed, by one or other of his sisters-in-law,
 at least twelve times in an hour. Neither could they do anything
 without Sophy. Somebody's hair fell down, and nobody but Sophy
 could put it up. Somebody forgot how a particular tune went, and
 nobody but Sophy could hum that tune right. Somebody wanted to recal
 the name of a place in Devonshire, and only Sophy knew it. Something
 was wanted to be written home, and Sophy alone could be trusted to write
 hefore breakfast in the morning. Somebody broke down in a piece of
 knitting, and no one but Sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right
 direction. They were entire mistresses of the place, and Sophy and
 Traddles waited on them. I-IOW      many children Sopl~ycould have taken
 care of in her time, I can't imagine ; but she seemed to be famous for
 knowing every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the
 English tongue ; a i d she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice
in the world, one after another (every sister issuing directions for a dif-
 ferent tune, and the Beauty generally striking in last), so that I was quite
fascinated. The best of all was, that, in the midst of their exactions,
all the sisters had a great tenderness and respect both for Soplly and
Traddles. I am sure, when I took my leave, and Traddles was coming
out to walk with me to the coffee-house, I thought I had never seen an
obstinate head of hair, or any other head of hair, rolling about in such a
shower of kisses.
    Altogether, it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure,
for a long time after I got back and had wishcd Traddles good night.
If I had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers, in
that withered Gray's Inn, they could not have brightened it half so much.
The idea of those Devonshire girls, among the dry law-stationers and the
attornies' offices ; and of the tea and toast, and children's songs, in that
grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment, red-tape, dusty wafers, inli-
jars, brief and draft paper, law reports, writs, declarations, and bills of
costs ; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed that the
Sultan's famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys, and
had brought the talking bird, the singing tree, and the golden water into
Gray's Inn Hall. Somehow, I found that I had taken leave of Traddles
for the night, and come back to the cofee-house, with a great change in
my despondency about him. I began to think he would get on, in
spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England.
    Drawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to think about him
at my leisure, I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to
tracing prospects in the live-coals, and to thinking, as they broke and
 changed, of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had marked my
life. I had not seen a coal fire, since I had left England three years ago :
though many a wood fire had I watched, as it crumbled into hoary ashes,
 and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth, which not inaptly
figured to me, in my despondency, my own dead hopes.
    I could think of the past now, gravely, but not bitterly; and could con-
template the f ~ ~ t u rine a brave spirit. Ilome, in its best sense, was for
me no more. She in whoni I might have inspired a dearer love, I had
taught to be my sister. She would marry, and would have new claimants
 590           THE PERSONAL HISTORY         r n ~EXPERIENCE
 on her tenderness ; and in doing it, would never know the love for her that
 had grown up in my heart. I t was right that I should pay the forfeit of
 my headlong passion. What I reaped, I had sown.
      I was thinking, And had I truly disciplined my heart to this, and
 could I resolutely bear it, and calmly hold the place in her home which
 she had calmly held in mine,-when I found my eyes resting on a coun-
 tenance that might have arisen out of the fire, in its association with my
 early remembrances.
     Little Mr. Chillip the Doctor, to whose good offices I was indebted in
 thevery first chapter of this history, sat reading a newspaper in the shadow
 of an opposite corner. H e was tolerably stricken in years by this time ;
 but, being a mild, meek, calm little man, had worn so easily, that I thought
 he looked at that moment just as he might     -   have looked when he sat in
 our parlor, waiting for me to be born.
     Mr. Chillip had left Blunderstone six or seven years ago, and I had
never seen him since. He sat placidly perusing the newspaper, with his
little head on one side, and a glass of warm sherry negas at his elbow.
He was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologise
to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it.
    I walked up to where he was sitting, and said, " How do you do,
Mr. Chillip ? "
    He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger,
and replied, in his slow way, " I thank you, sir, you are very good. Thank
you, sir. I hope you are well."
    " You don't remember me ? " said I.

     "Well, sir," returned Mr. Chillip, smiling very meekly, and shaking his
head as he surveyed me, " I have a kind of an impression that something
in your countenance is familiar to me, sir; but I couldn't lay my hand
upon your name, really."
    "And yet you knew it, long before I knew it myself," I returned.
    ' I Did I indeed, sir ? " said Mr. Chillip.  " I s it possible that I had the

honor, sir, of officiating when-       ?"
    " Yes," said I.

        Dear me ! " cried Mr. Chillip. " But no doubt you are a good deal
changed since then, sir ? "
   " Probably," said I.
   "Well, sir," observed hlr. Chillip, " I hope you'll excuse me, if I am
compelled to ask the favor of your name? "
    On &mytelling him my name, he was really moved. He quite shook
hands with me-which was a violent proceeding for him, his usual course
being to slide a tepid little fish-slice, an inch or two in advance of his hip,
and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it.
Even now, he put his hand in his coat pocket as soon as he could dis-
engage it, and seemed relieved when he had got it safe back.
     " Dear me, sir ! " said Mr. Chillip, surveying me with his head on one

side. "And it 'S Mr. Copperfield, is i t ? Well, sir, I think I should have
known you, if I had taken the liberty of looking more closely at you.
 There 'S a strong resemblance between you and your poor father, sir."
     " I never had the happiness of seeing my father," I observed.

     "Very true, sir," said Mr. Chillip, in a soothing tone. "And very
                       O F DAVID COPPEBEIELD.                            591
 much to be deplored it was, on all accounts ! We are not ignorant, sir,"
 said Mr. Chillip, slowly shaking his little head again, "down in our part
of the country, of your fame. There must be great excitement here, sir,"
 said Mr. Chillip, tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger.
 "You must find it a trying occupation, sir! "
    " What is your part of the country now 2 " I asked, seating myself

near him.
    " I am established within a few miles of Bury St. Edmunds, sir," said

Mr. Chillip. " Mrs. Chillip, coming into a little property in that neigh-
bourhood, under her father's will, I bought a practice down there, in which
YOU will be glad to hear I am doing well.      My daughter is growing quite
a tall lass now, sir," said Mr. Chillip, giving his little head another little
shake. " Her mother let down two tucks in her frocks only last week.
Such is Time, you see, sir ! "
    As the little man put his now empty glass to his lips, when he made
this reflection, I proposed to him to have it refilled, and I would keep him
company with another. " Well, sir," he retnrned in his slow way, " it 'S
more than I am accnstomed to ; but I can't deny myself the pleasure of
your conversation. I t seems but yesterday that I had the honor of
attending you in the measles. You came through them charmingly, sir ! "
   I acknowledged this compliment, and ordered the negus, which was
soon produced. " Quite an uncommon dissipation ! " said Mr. Chillip,
stirring it, "but I can't resist so extraordinary an occasion. You have
no family, sir ? "
    I shook my head.
    " I was aware that you sustained a bereavement, sir, somc time ago,"

said Mr. Chillip. " I heard it from your father-in-law's sister. Very
decided character there. sir ? "
    " Why, yes," said 'I, " decided enough. Where did you see her,
&fr. chilli^ ? "
    " Are you not aware, sir," returned Mr. Chillip, with his placidest
smile, " that your father-in-law is again a neighbour of mine ? "
    " No," said I.
    " EIe is indeed, sir ! " said Mr. Chillip. "Married a young lady of that
part, with a very good little property, poor thing.-And this action of
the brain now, sir? Don't you find it fatigue you? " said Mr. Chillip,
looking at me like an admiring Robin.
    I waived that question, and returned to the BIurdstones. "I was aware
of his being married again. Do you attend the family ? " I asked.
    "Not regularly. I have been called in," he replied. " Strong phreno-
logical development of the organ of firmness, in Mr. Murdstone and his
sister, sir."
    I replied with such an expressive look, that Mr. Chillip was emboldened
by that, and the negus together, to give his head several short shakes,
and thoughtfully exclaim, " Ah, dear me ! We remember old times, Mr.
Copperfield ! "
    "And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course, are they P "
said I.
    "Well, sir," replied Mr. Chillip, " a medical man, being so much in
families, ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but his pro-
 592            TIlE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 fession. Still, I must say, they are very severe, sir : both as to this life
 and the next."
     "The next will be regulated without much reference to them, I dare
 say," I returned : " what are they doing as to this ? "
     Mr. Chillip shook his head, stirred his negus, and sipped it.
     " She was a charming woman, sir ! " he observed in a plaintive manner.

     " The present Mrs. Murdstone ? "
     " A charming woman indeed, sir," said Mr. Chillip ; "as amiable, I am
 sure, as it was possible to be ! Mrs. Chillip's opinion is, that her spirit
 has been entirely broken since her marriage, and that she is all but
 melancholy mad. And the ladies," observed Mr. Chillip, timorously, "are
 great observers, sir."
    "I suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable
mould, Heaven help her ! " said I. " And she has been."
    " Well, sir, there were violent quarrels at first, I assure you," said Mr.
 Chillip ; "but she is quite a shadow now. Would it be considered forward
if I was to say to you, sir, in confidence, that since the sister came to
help, the brother and sister between them have nearly reduced her to a
state of imbecility."
    I told him I could easily believe it.
    " I have no hesitation in saying," said Mr. Chillip, fortifying himself
with another sip of negus, "between you and me, sir, that her mother
died of it-or that tyranny, gloom, and worry, have made Mrs. Murd-
stone nearly imbecile. She was a, lively young woman, sir, before marriage,
and their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her,
now, more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law. That was
Mrs. Chillip's remark to me, only last week. And I assure you, sir, the
ladies are great observers. Mrs. Chillip herself is a great observer ! "
    "Does he gloomily profess to be (I am ashamed to use the word in
such association) religious still? " I inquired.
    "You anticipate, sir," said Mr. Chillip, his eyelids getting quite red
with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging. " One of Mrs.
Chillip's most impressive remarks. Mrs. Chillip," he proceeded, in the
calmest and slowest manner, " quite electrified me, by pointing out that
Mr. Murdstone sets up an image of himself, and calls it the Divine Nature.
You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back, sir, with t,he
feather of a pen, I assure you, when Mrs. Chillip said so. The ladies are
great observers, sir ? "
    "Intuitively," said I, to his extreme delight.
    " I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion, sir," he
rejoined. " I t is not often that I venture to give a non-medical opinion,
I assure you. Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes, and
it is said,-in short, sir, it is said hg Mrs. Chillip,-that the darker tyrant
he has lately been, the more ferocious is his doctrine."
    " I believe Mrs. Chillip to be perfectly right," said I.

    " Mrs. Chillip does go so far as to say," pursued the meekest of little
 men, much encouraged, "that what such people miscall their religion, is a
 vent for their bad-humors and arrogance. And do you know I must
 say, sir," he continued, mildly laying his head on one side, "that I don't
 find authority for &fr. and Miss Murdstone in the New Testament ? "
                         O F DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   " I never found it either," said I.
   " I n the meantime, sir," said Mr. Chillip, "they are much disliked;
  and as they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them to
  perdition, we really have a good deal of perdition going on in our neigh-
  bourhood ! Ilowever, as Mrs. Chillip says, sir, they undergo a continual
  punishment; for they are turned inward, to feed upon their own hearts,
  and their own hearts are very bad feeding. Now, sir, about that brain of
  yours, if you'll excuse my returning to it. Don't you expose it to a
  good deal of excitement, sir ? "
    I found it not difficult, i n the excitement of Mr. Chillip's own brain,
 under his potations of negus, to divert his attention from this topic to
 his own aflairs, on which, for the next half hour, he was quite loquacious;
 giving me to understand, among other pieces of information, that he was
 then at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house to lay his professional evidence before
 a Commission of Lunacy, touching the state of mind of a patient who had
 become deranged from excessive drinking.
    "And I assure you, sir," he said, " I am extremely nervous on such
 occasions. I could not support being what is called Bullied, sir. I t
 would quite unrnan me. Do you know it was some time before I
 recovered the conduct of that alarming lady, on the night of your birth,
 Mr. Copperfield ? "
    I told him that I was going down to my aunt, the Dragon of that
night, early in the morning; and that she was one of the most tender-
hearted and excellent of women, as he would know h11 well if he knew
her better. The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her
again, appeared to terrify him. H e replied, with a small pale smile, " Is she
so, indeed, sir ? Really ? " and almost immediately called for a candle,
and went to bed, as if he were not qulte safe anywhere else. He did not
actually stagger under the negus; but I should think his placid little pulse
must have made two or three more beats in a minute, than it had done
since the great night of my aunt's disappointment, when she struck at him
with her bonnet,.
    Thoroughly tired, I went to bed too, at midnight; passed the next da.y
on the Dover coach; burst safe and sound into my aunt's old parlor
while she was at tea (she wore spectacles now); and was received by her,
and M r Dick, and dear old Peggotty, who acted as housekeeper, with open
arms and tears of joy. My aunt was mightily amused, when we began
to talk composedly, by my account of my meeting with Mr. Chdlip, and
of his holding her in such dread remembrance; and both she and Peggotty
had a great deal to say about my poor mother's second husband, and
"that murdering woman of a sister,"-on           whom I think no pain or
penalty would have induced my aunt to bestow any Christian or Proper
Name, or any other designation.
               TKE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE




                            CHAPTER LX.


   MY aunt and I, when we were left alone, tallred far into the night.
 How the emigrants never wrote home, otherwise than cheerfully and hope-
fully; how Mr. Micawber had actually remitted divers smali sums of
money, on account of those " pecuniary liabilities," in reference to which
he had been so business-like as between man and msn; how Janet,
returning into my aunt's service when she came back to Dover, had finally
carried out her renunciation of mankind by entering into wedlock with a
thriving tavern-keeper; and how my aunt had finally set hey seal on the
same great principle, by aiding and abetting the bride, and crowning
the marriage-ceremony with her presence ; were among our top~cs-already
more or less familiar to me through the letters I had had. Mr. Dick, as
usual, was not forgotten. My aunt informed me how he incessantly
occupied himself in copying everything he could lay his hands on, and kept
King Charles the First at a respectful distance by that semblance of
employment; how it was one of the main joys and rewards of her life that
he was free and happy, instead of pining in monotonous restraint; and
how (as a novel general conclusion) nobody but she could ever fully know
what he was.
   " And when, Trot,"     said my aunt, patting the back of my hand, as
we sat in our old way before the fire, "when are you going over to
Canterbury ? "
   " I shall get a horse, and ride over to-morrow morning, aunt, unless you
will go with me ? "
   " No! " said my aunt, in her short abrupt way. " I mean to stay
where I am."
   Then, I should ride, I said. I could not have come through Canterbury
to-day without stopping, if I had been coming to anyone but her.
   She was pleased, but answered, " Tut, Trot; my old bones would
have kept till to-morrow! " and softly patted my hand again, as I sat
looking thoughtfully a t the fire.
   Thoughtfully, for I could not be here once more, and so near Agnes,
without the revival of those regrets with which I had so long been occu-
pied. Softened regrets they might be, teaching me what I had failed to
learn when my younger life mas all before me, but not the less regrets.
 " Oh, Trot," I seemed to hear my aunt say once more ; and I understood

her better now-" Blind, blind, blind ! "
   We both kept silence for some minutes. When I raised my eyes, I
found that she was steadlly observant of me. Perhaps she had followed
 the current of my mind; for it seemed to me an easy one to track now,
wilful as it had been once.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          595
    " You will find her father a white-haired old man," said my aunt,
 "though a better man in all other respects-a reclaimed man. Neither
 will you find him measuring all human interests, and joys, and sorrows,
 with his one poor little inch-rale now. Trust me, child, such things must
 shrink very much, before they can be measured off in that way."
    " Indeed they must," said I.
    " You will find her," pursued my aunt, "as good, as beautiful, as

 earnest, as disinterested, as she has always been. If I knew higher praise,
 Trot, I would bestow it on her."
   There was no higher praise for her ; no higher reproach for me. 0, how
had I strayed so far away !
   "If she trains the young girls whom she has about her, to be like
herself," said my aunt, earnest even to the filling of her eyes with tears,
"Heaven knows, her life will be well employed ! Useful and happy, as
she said that day ! Wow could she be otherwise than useful and happy !"
   "Has Agnes any -" I was thinking aloud, rather than speaking.
   "Well? Hey ? Any what ? " said my aunt, sharply.
   "Any lover," said I.
   " A score," cried my aunt, with a kind of indignant pride. " She
might have married twenty times, my dear, since you have been gone ! "
   "No doubt," said I. " N o donbt. But has she any lover who is
worthy of her? Agnes could care for no other."
   My aunt sat musing for a little while, with her chin upon her hand.
Slowly raising her eyes to mine, she said :
   " I suspect she has an attachment, Trot."
   "A prosperous one ? " said I.
   "Trot," returned my aunt gravely, " I can't say. I have no right to
tell you even so much. She has never confided it to me, but I suspect it."
   She looked so attentively and anxiously at me (I even saw her tremble),
Ghat I felt now, more than ever, that she had followed my late thoughts.
I summoned all the resolutions I had made, in all those many days and
nights, and all those many conflicts of my heart.
   " If it should be so," I began, " and I hope it is-"

   " I don't know that it is," said my aunt curtly. "You must not be
ruled by my suspicions. You must keep them secret. They are very
slight, perhaps. I have no right to speak."
   " If it should be so," I repeated, " Agnes will tell me at her own good

time. A sister to whom I have confided so much, aunt, will not be
reluctant to confide in me."
   My aunt withdrew her eyes from mine, as slowly as she had turned
them upon me; and covered them thoughtf~~lly       with her hand. 'By arid
by she put her other hand on my shoulder; and so we both sat,
looking into the past, without saying another word, until we parted for
the night.
   I rode away, early in the morning, for the scene of my old school days.
I cannot say that I was yet quite happy, in the hope that I was gaining a
victory over myself; even in the prospect of so soon looking on her face
again.
    The well-remembered ground was soon traversed, and I came into the
quiet streets, where every stone was a boy's book to me. I went on
                                                          Q    Q   ~

foot to the old house, and went away with a heart too full to enter.
I returned ; and looking, as I passed, through the low window of the
turret-room where first Uriah Heep, and afterwards Mr. Micawber, had
been wont to sit, saw that it was a little parlor now, and that there
was no office. Otherwise the staid old house was, as to its cleanliness
and order, still just as i t had been when I first saw it. I requested the
new maid who admitted me, to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman who
waited on her from a friend abroad, was there ; and I was shown up the
grave old staircase (cautioned of the steps I knew so well), into the unchanged
drawing-room. The books that Agnes and I had read together, were on
their shelves; and the desk where I had labored at my lessons, many a
night, stood yet at the same old corner of the table. All the littlechanges
that had crept in when the Heeps were there, were changed again.
Everything was as it used to be, in the happy time.
    I stood in a window, and looked across the ancient street at the oppo-
site houses, recalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons, when I
first came there; and how I had used to speculate about the people who
appeared at any of the windows, and had followed them with my eyes u p
and down stairs, while women went clicking along the pavement in pattens,
and the dull rain fell in slanting lines, and poured out of the waterspout
yonder, and flowed into theroad. The feeling with which I used to watch
the tramps, as they came into the town on those wet evenings, at dusk,
 and limped past, with their bundles drooping over their shoulders at, the
 ends of sticks, came freshly back to me; fraught, as then, with the smell of
 damp earth, and wet leaves and briar, and the sensation of the very airs
 that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey.
    The opening of the little door in the panneled wall made me start and
 turn. I-Ier beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me.
 She stopped and laid her hand upon her bosom, and I caught her i n
 my arms.
    " Agnes ! my dear girl ! I have come too suddenly upon you."

    "No, no ! I am so rejoiced to see you, Trotwood l "
    "Dear Agnes, the happiness it is to me, to see you once again! "
    I folded her to my heart, and, for a little while, we were both silent.
Presently we sat down, side by side; and her angel-face was turned upon
me with the welcome I had dreamed of, waking and sleeping, fbr whole
years.
    She was so true, she was so beautiful, she was so good,-I owed her so
much gratitude, she was so dear to me, that I could find no utterance
for what I felt. I tried to bless her, tried to thank her, tried to tell her
(as I had often done in letters) what an influence she had upon me; but
all my efforts were in vain. My love and joy were dumb.
    With her own sweet tranquillity, she calmed my agitation; led me back
t o the time of our parting; spoke to me of Emily, whom she had visited,
i n secret, many times ; spoke to me tenderly of Dora's grave. With the
unerring instinct of her noble heart, she touched the chords of my
memory so softly and harmoniously, that not one jarred within me; I
 could listen to the sorrowful, distant music, and desire to shrink from
 nothing i t awoke. How could I, when, blended with it all, was her dear
 self, the better angel of my life?

598           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

tated on Miss Shepherd and the eldest Miss Larkins, and all the idle
loves and likings, and dislikings, of that time. Nothing seemed to have
survived that time but Agnes; and she, ever a star above me, was brighter
and higher.
    When I returned, Mr. ~ i c k f i e l dhad come home, from a garden he
had, a couple of miles or so out of the town, where he now employed
himself almost every day. I found him as my aunt had described him. We
sat down to dinner, with some half-dozen little girls; and he seemed but
the shadow of his handsome picture on the wall.
    The tranquillity and peace belonging, of old, to that quiet ground in
my memory, pervaded it again. When dinner was done, Mr. Wickfield
taking no wine, and I desiring none, we went up stairs; where Agnes and
her little charges sang and played, and worked. After tea the children
left us; and we three sat together, talking of the by-gone days.
    " My part in them," said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his white head, "has
much matter for regret-for deep regret, and deep contrition, Trotwood,
you well know. But I would not cancel it, if it were in my power."
    1could readily believe that, looking at the face beside him.
    " I should cancel with it," he pursued, "such patience and devotion,
such fidelity, such a child's love, as I must not forget, no ! even to forget
myself."
      I understand you, sir," I softly said. " I hold it-I have always held
it-in veneration."
    " But no one knows, not even             he returned, " how much she has
done, how much she has undergone, how hard she has striven. Dear
Agnes ! "
    She had put her hand entreatingly on his arm, to stop him ; and was
very, very, pale.
    " Well, well !" he said with a sigh, dismissing, as I then saw, some

trial she had borne, or was yet to bear, in connexion with what my aunt
had told me. "Well! I have never told you, Trotwood, of her mother.
Has any one ? "
    " Never, sir."
    " I t 'S not much-though    it was much to suffer. She married me in
opposition to her father's wish, and he renounced her. She prayed him
to forgive her, before my Agnes came into this world. He was a very
hard man, and her mother had long been dead. H e repulsed her. He
broke her heart."
    Agnes leaned upon his shoulder, and stole her arm about his neck.
    " She had an affeclionate and gentle heart," he said; "and it was
broken. I knew its tender nature very well. No one could, if I did not.
She loved me dearlg, but was never happy. She was always laboring, in
secret, under this distress; and being delicate and downcast at the time
of his last repulse-for    it was not the first, by many-pined away and
died. She left me Agnes, two weeks old; and the grey hair that you
recollect me with, when you first came."
    He kissed Agnes on her cheek.
    " My love for my dear child was a diseased love, but my mind was
all unhealthy then. I say no more of that. I am not speaking of myself,
Trotwood, but of her mother, and of her. If I give you any clue to what
I am, or to what I have been, you will unravel it, I know. What Agnes
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                          599
is, I need not say. I have always read something of her poor mother's
story, in her character; and so I tell it you to-night, when we three
are again together, after such great changes. I have told it all."
   His bowed head, and her angel face and filial duty, derived a more
pathetic meaning from it than they had had before. If I had wanted
anything by which to mark this night of our reunion, I should have
found it in this.
   Agnes rose up from her father's side, before long; and going softly
to her piano, played some of the old airs to which we had often listened
in that place.
    " Have you any intention of going away again ? " Agnes asked me, as

I was standing by.
    " What does my sister say to that ? "

    " I hope not."

    " Then I have no such intention, Agnes."
    " I think you ought not, Trotwood, since you ask me," she said, mildly.

"Your growing reputation and success enlarge your power of doing good ;
and if I could spare my brother," with her eyes upon me, " perhaps the
time could not."
    " What I am, you have made me, Agnes.         You should know best."
    " I made you, Trotwood? "

    " Yes ! A p e s , my dear girl ! " I said, bending over her. " I tried to

tell you, when we met to-day, something that has been in my thoughts
since Dora died. You remember, when you came down to me in our little
room-pointing upward, Agnes? "
    "Oh, Trotwood! " she returned, her eyes filled with tears. "So
loving, so confid~ng,and so young ! Can 1 ever forget ? "
    "As you were then, my sister, I have often thought since, you have
ever been to me. Ever pointing upward, Agnes; ever leading me to
something better ; ever directing me to higher things ! "
    She only shook her head; through her tears I saw the same sad
quiet smile.
    "And I am so grateful to you for it, Agnes, so bound to you, that
there is no name for the affection of my heart. I want you to know, yet
don't know how to tell you, that all my life long I shall look up to you,
and be guided by you, as I have been through the darkness that is past.
Whatever betides, whatever new ties you may form, whatever changes may
come between us, I shall always look to you, and love you, as I do now,
and have always done. You will always he my solace and resource, as you
have always been. Until I die, my dearest sister, I shall see you always
before me, pointing upward ! "
    She put her hand in mine, and told me she was proud of me, and of
what I said ; although I praised her very far beyond her worth. Then,
she went on softly playing, but without removing her eyes from me.
    "Do you know, what I have heard to-night, Agnes," said I, " strangely
seems to be a part of the feeling with which I regarded you when I saw
you first-with which I sat beside you in my rough school-days ? "
    "You knew 1 had no mother," she replied with a smile, "and felt
kindly towards me."
    " More than that, Agnes.     I knew, almost as if I had known this story,
              THE PERSONAL HISTORY        AND   EXPERIENCE

that there was something inexplicably gentle and softened, surrounding
you ; something that might have been sorrowful in some one else (as I can
now understand it was), but was not so in you."
   She softly played on, looking at me still.
   "Will you laugh at my cherishing such fancies, Agnes? "
   "No ! "
   " Or at my saying that I really believe I felt, even then, that you
could be faithfully affectionate against all discouragement, and never cease
to be so, until you ceased to live ?-Will you langh at such a dream ? "
   " Oh, no !    Oh, no ! "
   For an instant, a distressful shadow crossed her face ; but, even i n the
start it gave me, it was gone; and she was playing on, and looking at me
with her own calm smile.
   As I rode back in tlie lonely night, the wind going by me like a
restless memory, I thought of this, and feared she was not happy. I was
not happy ; but, thus far, I had faithfully set the seal upon the Past, and,
thinking of her, pointing upward, thought of her as pointing to that
sky above me, where, in the mystery to come, I might yet love her with
a love unknown on earth, and tell her what the strife had been within
me when I loved her here.




                           CHAPTER LXI.
             I AM SIIOWN TWO INTERESTING PENITENTS.

   FORa time-at        all events until my book should be completed,
which would be the work of several months-I took up my abode i n my
aunt's house at Dover; and there, sitting in the window from which I had
loolred out at the moon upon the sea, when that roof first gave me shelter,
I quietly pursued my task.
   I n pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when
their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my
story, I do not enter on the aspirations, the delights, anxieties, and
triumphs, of my art. That I truly devoted myself to it with my strongest
earnestness, and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul, I have already
said. If the books I have written be of any worth, they will supply the
rest. I shall otherwise have written to poor purpose, and the rest will be
of interest to no one.
   Occasionally, I went to London; to lose myself i n the swarm of life
there, or to consult with Traddles on some business point. H e had
managed for me, in my absence, with the soundest judgment; and my
worldly affairs were prospering. As my notoriety began to bring upon
 me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom I had no know-
ledge-chiefly about nothing, and extremely difficult to answer-I agreed
                       OF DAVID COPPEELFIELD.                         601
with Traddles to have my name painted up on his door. There, the devoted
postmen on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me; and there, a t
intervals, I labored through them, like a Home Secretary of State without
the salary.
   Among this correspondence, there dropped in, every now and then,
an obliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking
about the Commons, to practise under cover of my name (if I would take
the necessary sleps rem6ning to make a proctor of myself), and pay me
a percentage on the profits. But I declnied these offers; being already
aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in ex~stence,and
considering the Commons quite bad enough, without my doing anything
to make ~t worse.
   The girls had gone home, when my name burst into bloom on Traddles's
door; and the sharp boy looked, all day, as if he had never heard of
Sophy, shut up in a back room, glanclng down from her work into a
sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it. But, there I always found
her, the same bright housewife ; often humming her Devonshire ballads
when no strange foot was coming up the stairs, and blunting the sharp
boy in his offic~alcloset with melody.
   I wondered, at first, why I so often found Sophy writing in a copy-book;
and why she always shut it up when I appeared, and hurrled it into the
table-drawer. But the secret soon came out. One day, Tradtiles (who
had just come home through the dr~zzlingsleet from Court) took a
paper out of his desk, and asked me what I thought of that handwriting?
   "Oh, don't, Tom! " cried Sophy, who was warming his slippers before
the fire.
   " M y dear," returned Tom, i n a delighted state, "why n o t ? TnThat
do you say to that writing, Copperfield? "
   " It 'S extraordinarily legal and formal," said I. " 1don't think I ever
saw such a stiff' hand."
   " Not like a lady's hand, is il ? " said Traddles.
   " A lady's ! " I repeated. " Bricks and mortar are more like a lady's
hand ! "
   Traddles broke into a raptnrous laugh, and informed me that it was
Sophy's writing; that Sophy had vowed and declared he would need a
copying-clerk soon, and she wonld be that clerk ; that she had acqu~redthis
hand fiom a pattern ; and that she could throw of-I forget how many
folios an hour. Sophy was very much confused by my being told all this,
and said that when " Tom " was madc a judge he wouldn't be so ready
to proclaim it. Which " Tom " denied ; averring that he should always
be equally proud of it, under all circumstances.
   " What a thoroughly good and charming wife she is, my dear Traddles ! "
said I, when she had gone away, laughing.
   " My dear Copperfield," returned Traddles, " she is, without any excep-

tion, the dearest girl ! The way she manages this place ; her punctuality,
domestic knowledge, economy, and order ; her cheerfulness, Copperfield ! "
    "Indeed, you have reason to commend her ! " I returned. "You
are a happy fellow. I believe you make yourselves, and each other, two
of the happiest people in the world."
   " I am sure we ure two of the happiest people," returned Traddles.
602            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 "I admit that, at all events. Bless my soul, when I see her getting up
 by candle-light on these dark mornings, busying herself in the day's
 arrangements, going out to market before the clerks come into the Inn,
caring for no weather, devising the most capital little dinners out of the
plainest materials, making puddings and pies, keeping everything in its
right place, always so neat and ornamental herself, s ~ t t ~ up
                                                              n g at night with
me if lt 'S ever so late, sweet-tempered and encouraging always, and all for
me, I positively sometimes can't believe it, Copperfield ! "
    He was tender of the very slippers she had been warming, as he put
them on, and stretched his feet enjogingly upon the fender.
    " I positively sometimes can't believe it," said Traddles. "Then, our
pleasures ! Dear me, they are inexpensive, but they are quite wonderful !
When we are at home here, of an evening, and shut the outer door, and
draw those curtains-which she made-where could we be more snug?
When it 'S fine, and we go out for a walk in the evening, the streets abound
ill enjoyment for us. We look into the glittering windows of the jewellers'
shops; and I show Sophy which of the diamond-eyed serpents, coiled up on
white satin rising grounds, I wouid give her if I could afford i t ; and
Sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelled
and engine-turned, and possessed of the horizontal lever-escape-movement,
and all sorts of things, she would buy for me if she could afford i t ; and
we pick out the spoons and forks, fish-slices, butter-knives, and sugar-
tongs, we should both prefer if we could both afford it ; and really we go
away as if we had got them ! Then, when we stroll into the squares, and
great streets, and see a house to let, sometimes we look up at it, and say,
how would that do, if I was made a judge ? And we parcel it out-such
a room for us, such rooms for the girls, and so forth ; until we settle to our
satisfaction that it would do, or it wouldn't do, as the case may be.
Sometimes, we go at half-price to the pit of the theatre-the very smell of
which is cheap, in my opinion, at the money-and there we thoroughly
enjoy the play : which Sophy believes every word of, and so do I. I n
walking home, perhaps we buy a little bit of something at a cook's-shop, or
a little lobster at the fishmonger's, and bring it here, and make a splendid
supper, chatting about what we have seen. Now, you know, Copperfidd,
if I was Lord Chancellor, we couldn't do this ! "
    "You would do something, whatever you were, my dear Traddles,"
thought I, "that would be pleasant and amiable! And by the way," I
said aloud, " I suppose yon never draw any skeletons now ? "
    " Really," replied Tracldles, laughing, and reddening, " 1 can't wholly
deny that I do, my dear Copperfield. For, being in one of the back rotvs
of the King's Bench the other day, with a pen in nly hand, the fancy came
into my head to try how I had preserved that accomplishment. And I
am afraid there 'S a skeleton-in a wig-on the ledge of the desk."
   After we had both laughed heartily, Traddles wound up by looking with
a smile at the fire, and saying, in his forgiving way, " Old Creakle !"
    "I have a letter from that old-Rascal here," said I. For I never
was less disposed to forgive him the way he used to batter Traddles,
than when I saw Traddles so ready to forgive him himself.
    " Prom Creakle the schoolmaster ? " exclaimed Traddles.        " No ! "
    "Among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

 fortune," said I, looking over my letters, "and who discover that they
were always much attached to me, is the self-same Creakle. H e is not a
 schoolmaster now, Traddles. He is retired. H e is a Middlesex
Magistrate."
    1 thought Traddles might be surprised to hear it, but he was not
so at all.
    " How do you suppose he comes to be a Middlesex Magistrate? "

said I.
    " Oh dear me ! " replied Traddles, " it would be very difficult to answer

that question. Perhaps he voted for somebody, or lent money to somebody,
or bought something of somebody, or otherwise obliged somebody, or
jobbed for somebody, who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the
county to nominate him for the commission."
    "On the commission he is, at any rate," said I. " And he writes to
me here, that he will be glad to show me, in operation, the only true
system of prison discipline ; the only unchallengeable way of making sincere
and lasting converts and penitents-which, you know, is by solitary
confinement. WhaL do you say ? "
    " To the system ? " inquired Traddles, looking grave.

    " No.   To my accepting the offer, and your going with me? "
    " 1 don't object," said Traddles.
    " Then I'll write to say so.    You remember (to say nothing of our
treatment) this same Creakle turning his son out of doors, 1 suppose,
and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter? "
    " Perfectly," said Traddles.

    "Yet, if you'll read his letter, you'll find he is the tenderest of men
to prisoners convicted of the whole calendar of felonies," said I ; "though
I can't find that his tenderness extends to any other class of created
beings."
    Traddles shrugged his shoulders, and was not at a11 surprised. I had
not expected him to be, and was not surprised myself; or my observation of
similar practical satires would have been but scanty, We arranged the time
of our visit, and I wrote accordingly to Mr. Creakle that evening.
    On the appointed day-I think it was the next day, but no matter-
Traddles and I repaired to the prison where Mr. Crealtle was powerful.
I t was an immense and solid building, erected at a vast expense. I could
not help thinking, as we approached the gate, what an uproar would have
been made in the country, if any deluded man had proposed to spend one
half the money it had cost, on the erection of an industrial school for the
young, or a house of refuge for the deserving old.
    In an office that might have been on the ground-floor of the Tower of
Babel, it was so massively constructed, we were presented to our old
schoolmaster; who was one of a group, composed of two or three of the
busier sort of magistrates, and some visitors they had brought. H e received
me, like a man who had formed my mind in bygone pears, and had always
loved me tenderly. On my introducing Traddles, Mr. Creakle expressed, in
like manner, but in an inferior degree, that he had always been Traddles's
guide, philosopher, and friend. Our venerable instructor was a great deal
older, and not improved in appearance. His face was as fiery as ever;
his eyes were as small, and rather deeper set. The scanty, wet-looking
604           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

grey hair, by which I remembered him, was almost gone; and the thick
veins in his bald head were none the more agreeable to look at.
    After some conversation among these gentlemen, fkom which I might
have supposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately
taken into account but the supreme comfort of prisoners, at any expense,
and nothing on the wide earth to be done outside prison-doors, we began
our inspection. I t being then just dinner-time, we went, first into the
great kitchen, where every prisoner's dlnner was in course of being set
out separately (to be handed to him in his cell), with the regularity and
precision of clock-work. I said aside, to Traddies, that l wondered
whether it occurred to anybody, that there was a striking contrast between
these plentiful repasts of cho~cequality, and the dinners, not to say of
paupers, but of soldiers, sailors, laborers, the great bulk of the honest,
working community ; of whom not one man in five hundred ever dined half
so well. But I learned that the " system" required high living; and, in
short, to dispose of the system, once for all, I found that on that head
and on all others, "the system " put an end to all doubts, and disposed of
all anomalies. Nobody appeared to have the least idea that there was any
other system, but the system, to be considered.
    As we were going through some of the magnificent passages, I inquired
of Mr. Creakle and his friends what were supposed to be the main
advantages of this all-governing and universally over-riding system? 1
found them to be the perfect isolation of prisoners-so that no one man
in confinement there, knew anything about another; and the reduction of
prisoners to a wholesome state of mind, leading to sincere contrition and
repentance.
    Now, it struck me, when we began to visit individuals in their cells,
and to traverse the passages in whlch those cells were, and to have the
manner of the going to chapel and so forth, explained to us, that there was
a strong probability of the prisoners knowing a good deal about each other,
and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse. This, at
the time I write, has been proved, I believe, to be the case; but, as i t
would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a
doubt then, I looked out for the penitence as diligently as I could.
    And here again, I had great misgivings. I found as prevalent a
fashion in the form of the penitence, as I had left outside in the
forms of the coats and waistcoats in the windows of the tailors' shops.
I found a vast amount of profession, varying very little in character:
 varying very little (which I thought exceedingly suspicious), even in
 words. I found a great many foxes, disparaging whole lineyards of
 inaccessible grapes; but I found very few foxes whom I would have
 trusted within reach of a bunch. Above all, I found that the most pro-
 fessing men were the greatest objects of interest; and that their conceit,
 their vanity, their want of excitement, and their love of deception (which
 many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent, as their histories
 showed), all prompted to these professions, and were all gratified by them.
     However, I heard so repeatedly, in the course of our goings to and fro,
  of a certain Number Twenty Seven, who was the Favorite, and who really
  appeared to be a Model Prisoner, that I resolved to suspend my judgment
  untll I should see Twenty Seven. Twenty Eight, I understood, was also
                         OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                            605
 a bright particular star; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little
 dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of Twenty Seven. I heard so much
of Twenty Seven, of his pious admonitions to everybody around him, and
of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother (whom he
seemed t o consider i n a very bad way), that I became quite impatient t o
see him.
    I had to restrain my impatience for some time, on account of Twenty
Seven being reserved for a concluding effect. But, at last, we came to the
door of his cell; and Mr. Creakle, loolting through a little hole in it,
reported to us, in a state of the greatest admiration, that he was readmg
a Hymn Book.
    There was such a rush of heads immediately, to see Number Twenty
Seven reading his Hymn Book, that the little hole was blocked up, six or
seven heads deep. To remedy this inconvenience, and give us an oppor-
tunity of conversing with Twenty Seven in all his purity, Mr. Creakle
directed the door of the cell to be unlocked, and Twenty Seven to be
invited out into the passage. This was done; and whom should Traddles
and I then behold, to our amazement, in this converted Number Twenty
Seven, but Uriah Heep !
    H e knew us directly; and said, as he came out-with the old writhe,-
    " How do you do, Mr. Copperfield ? Eow do you do, Mr. Traddles ? "
    This recognition caused a general admiration in the party. I rather
thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud, and taking
notice of us.
    '< Well, Twenty Seven," said Mr. Creakle, mournfully admiring him.
"How do you find yourself to-day ? "
    " I am very umble, sir ! " replied Uriah Heep.

    "You are always so, Twenty Seven," said Mr. Creakle.
    Here, another gentleman asked, with extreme anxiety : " Are you quite
comfortable ? "
    "Yes, I thank you, sir! " said Uriali Heep, looking in that direction.
"Par more comfortable here, than ever I was outside. I see my follies
now, sir. That 'S what makes me comfortable."
    Several gentlemen were much affected ; and a third questioner, forcing
himself to the front, inquired with extreme feeling : '' How do you find
the beef? "
    " Thank you, sir," replied Uriah, glancing in the new direction of this
voice, "it was tougher yesterday than I could wish ; but it 'S my duty to
bear. I have committed follies, gentlemen," said Uriah, looking rouna
with a meek smile, "and I ought to bear the consequences without
repining."
    A murmur, partly of gratification at Twenty Seven's celestial state of
mind, and partly of indignation against the Contractor who had given him
any cause of complaint (a note of which was immediately made by
Mr. Creakle), having subsided, Twenty Seven stood in the midst of us, as if
he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum.
That we, the neophytes, might have an excess of light shining upon us all
a t once, orders were given to let out Twenty Eight.
    I had been so much astonished already, that I only felt a kind of resigned
wonder when Mr. Littimer walked forth, reading a good book!

some medium of communication; and a murmur went round the group,
as his door shut upon him, that he was a most respectable man, and a
beautiful case.
   "Xow, Twenty Seven," said Mr. Creakle, entering on a clear stage with
his man, "is there anything that any one can do for you? If so, men-
tion it."
     I would umbly ask, sir," returned Uriah, with a jerk of his malevolent
head, "for leave to write again to mother."
   " I t shall certainly be granted," said Mr. Creakle.

   "Thank you, sir! I am anxious about mother. I am afraid she ain't
safe."
   Somebody incautiously asked, what from? But there was a scandalised
whisper of " Hush ! "
   " Immortally safe, sir," returned Uriah, writhing in the direction of

the voice. " I should wish mother to be got into my state. I never
should have been got into my present state if I hadn't come here. I
wish mother had come here. I t would be better for everybody, if they
got took up, and was brought here."
   This sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction-greater satisfaction, 1
think, than anything that had passed yet.
   "Before I come here," said Uriah, stealing a look at us, as if he would
have blighted the outer world to which we belonged, if he could, " I was
given to follies ; bnt now I am sensible of my follies. There's a deal of
sin outside. There's a deal of sin in mother. There's nothing but sin
every where-except here."
   " You are quite changed ? " said Mr. Creakle.

   " Oh dear, yes, sir ! " cried this hopeful penitent.
   "You wouldn't relapse, if you were going out? " asked somebody else.
   " Oh de-ar no, sir ! "
   "Well ! " s a d Mr. Creakle, "this is very gratifying. You have
addressed Mr. Copperfield, Twenty Seven. Do you wish to say anything
further to him? "
   "You knew me, a long time before I came here and was changed, Mr.
Copperfield," said Uriah, looking at me; and a more villainous look I
never saw, even on his visage. "You knew me when, in spite of my
follies, I was umble among them that was proud, and meek among them
that was violent-you was violent to me yourself, Mr. Copperfield. Once,
you struck me a blow in the face, you know."
   General commiseration. Several indignant glances directed at me.
   "But I forgive you, Mr. Copperfield," said Uriah, making his forgiving
nature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel, which I shall not
record. " I forgive everybody. I t would ill become me to bear malice.
I freely forgive you, and I hope you '11 curb your passions in future. I
hope Mr. W. will repent, and Miss W., and all of that sinful lot. You 've
been visited with affliction, and I hope it may do you good; but you'd
better have come here. Mr. W. had better have come here, and Miss W.
too. The besl wish I could give you, Mr. Copperfield, and give all of you
gentlemen, is, that you could be took up and brought here. When I
think of my past follies, and my present state, I am sure it would be best
for you. I pity all who ain't brought here! "
               T H E PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

    H e sneaked back into his cell, amidst a little chorus of approbation;
 and both Traddles and I experienced a great relief when he was locked in.
    It was a characteristic feature in this repentance, that I was fain to ask
 what these two men had done, to be there a t all. That appeared to be
 the last thing about which they had anything to say. I addressed myself
to one of the two warders, who, I suspected, from certain latent indications
in their faces, knew pretty well what all this stir was worth.
    ' < D o you know," said I, as we walked along the passage, "what felony
was Number Twent,y Seven's last 'folly ?' "
   The answer was, that it was a Bank case.
    " A fraud or1 the Bank of England ? " I asked.
    "Yes, sir. Fraud, forgery, and conspiracy. H e and some others.
E-Ie set the others on. It was a deep plot for a large sum. Sentence,
transportation for life. Twenty Seven was the knowingest bird of the lot,
and had very nearly kept himself safe; but not quite. The Bank was just
able to put salt upon his tail-and only just."
    " D o you know Twenty Eight's offence?"
    " Twenty Eight," returned my informant, speaking throughout in a
low tone, and looking over his shoulder as we walked along the passage,
to guard himself from being overheard, in such an unlawfi~lreference to
these Imn~aculates,by Creakle and the rest ; "Twenty Eight (also trans-
portation) got a place, and robbed a young master of a matter of two
hundred and fifty pounds in money and valuables, the night before they
were going abroad. I particularly recollect his case, from his being took
by a dwarf.
    " A what?"
   " A little woman. I have forgot her name."
   " N o t Mowcher ? "
    "That 'S it ! H e had eluded pursuit, and was going to America In a
flaxen wig, and whiskers, and such a complete disguise as never you see
in all your born days ; when the little woman, being in Southampton, met
him walking along the street-picked him out with her sharp eye i n a
moment-ran        betwixt his legs to upset him-and      held on to him like
grim Death."
   "Excellent Miss hlowcher ! " cried I.
   "You'd have said so, if you had seen her, standing on a chair in the
witness-box at his trial, as I did," said my friend. " H e cut her face
right open, and pounded her in the most brutal manner, when she took
him ; but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up. She held so tight
to him, in fact, that the officers were obliged to take 'em both together.
She gave her evidence in the gamest way, and was highly complimented
by the Bench, and cheered right home to her lodgings. She said in
Court that she 'd have took him single-handed (on account of what she knew
concerning him), if he had been Samson. And it 'S my belief she would! "
   I t was mine too, and I highly respected Miss Mowcher for it.
   W e had now seen all there was to see. It would have been in vain to
represent to sneh a man as the Worshipful Mr. Creakle, that Twenty
Seven and Twenty Eight were perfectly consistent and unchanged; that
exactly what they were then, they had always been ; that the hypocritical
ltnaves were just the subjects to make that sort of profession in such a

place; that they knew its market-value at least as well as we did, in the
immediate s~rviceit would do them when they were expatriated ; in a word,
that it was a rotten, hollow, painfully-suggestive piece of business altogether.
We left them to their system and themselves, and went home wondering.
   " Perhaps it 'S a good thing, Traddles," said I, " to have an unsound
Hobby ridden hard ; for it 'S the sooner ridden to death."
   " I hope so," replied Traddles.




                            CRAPTER LXII.
                      A LIGHT SHINES ON M Y WAY.

   THEyear came round to Christmas-time, and I had been at home above
two months. I had seen Agnes frequently. However loud the general
voice might be i n giving me encouragement, and however fervent the
emotions and endeavours to which it roused me, I heard her lightest word
of praise as I heard nothing else.
   At least once a week, and sometimes oftener, I rode over there, and
passed the evening. I usually rode back a t night; for the old unhappy
sense was always hovering about me now-most sorrowfully when I left her
-and I was glad to be up and out, rather than wandering over the past
in weary wakefulriess or miserable dreams. I wore away the longest part
of many wild sad nights, in those rides; reviving, as I went, the thoughts
that had occupied me in my long absence.
   Or, if I were to say rather that I listened to the echoes of those thoughts,
I should better express the truth. They spoke to me from afar off. I
had put them at a distance, and accepted my inevitable place. When I
read to Agnes what I wrote ; when I saw her listening face ; moved her to
smiles or tears ; and heard her cordial voice so earnest on the shadowy
events of that imaginative world in which I lived; I thought what a fate
mine might have been-but only thought so, as I had thought after I was
married to Dora, what I could have wished my wife to be.
   My duty to Agnes, who loved me with a love, which, if I disquieted,
I wronged most selfishly and poorly, and could never restore; my matured
assurance that I, who had worked out my own destiny, and won what
I had impetuously set my heart on, had no right to murmur, and must
bear; comprised what I felt and what I had learned. But I loved her:
and now it even became some consolation to me, vaguely to conceive a distant
day when I might blamelessly avow it ; when all this should be over ; when
I could say " Agnes, so it was when I came home; and now I am old,
and I never have loved since ! "
   She did not once show me any change in herself. What she always had
been to me, she still was; wholly unaltered.
   Between my annt and me there had been something, in this connexion,
since the night of my return, which I cannot call a restraint, or an avoidance
of the subject, so much as an implied understanding that we thought of it
                                                                 RR
610            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

together, bnt did not shape our thoughts into words. When, according
to our old custom, we sat before the fire at night, we often fell into this
train; as naturally, and as consc~ouslyto each other, as if we had unre-
servedly said so. But we preserved an unbroken silence. I believed that
she had read, or partly read, my thoughts that night; and that she fully
comprehended why I gave mine no more distinct expression.
   This Christmas-time being come, and Agnes having reposed no new
confidence in me, a doubt that had several times arisen in my mind-
whether she could have that perception of the true state of my breast,
which restrained her with the apprehension of giving me pain-began to
oppress me heavily. If that were so, my sacrifice was nothing ; my plainest
obligation to her unfulfilled; and every poor action I had shrunk from, I
was hourly doing. I resolved to set this right beyond all doubt ;-if such a
barrier were between us, to break it down at once with a determined hand.
   I t was-what      lasting reason have I to remember it !-a cold, harsh,
winter day. There had been snow, some hours before; and it lay, not
deep, but hard-frozen on the ground. Out at sea, beyond my window,
the wind blew ruggedly from the north. I had been thinking of it, sweep-
ing over those mountain wastes of snow in Switzerland, then inaccessible
to any human foot ; and had been speculating which was the lonelier, those
solit,ary regions, or a deserted ocean.
    "Biding to-day, Trot? " said my aunt, putting her headin at the door.
    " Yes," said I, " I am going over to Canterbury. I t 'S a good day for
a ride."
    " I hope your horse may think so too," said my aunt ; "but at present

he is holding down his head and his ears, standing before the door there,
as if he thought his stable preferable."
    My aunt, I may observe, allowed my horse on the forbidden ground,
but had not at all relented toward the donkeys.
    " H e will be fresh enough, presently ! " said I.
    "The ride will do his master good, at all events," observed my aunt,
 glancing at the papers on my table. "Ah, child, you pass a good many
hours here ! I never thought, when I used to read books, what work it
was to write them."
    " It 'S work enough to read them, sometimes," I returned.    " As to the
writing, it has its own charms, aunt."
    " A11 ! I see ! " said my aunt. " Ambition, love of approbation, sym-
pathy, and much more, I suppose ? Well : go along with you ! "
    "Do you know anything more," said I, standing composedly before her
-she had patted me on the shoulder, and sat down in my chair, " of that
attachment of Agnes? "
   She loolred up in my face a little while, before replying :
   " I think I do, Trot."
   "Are you confirmed in your impression? " I inquired.
   " I think I am, Trot."

   She looked so steadfastly at me : with a kind of doubt, or pity, or
suspense in her affection : that I summoned the stronger determination to
show her a perfectly cheerful face.
    " And what is more, Trot-"      said my aunt.
    "Yes!"
                        OF DAVID COPPERPIELD.

  " I think Agnes is going to be married."
  " God bless her ! " said I, cheerfully.

  " God bless her ! " s a d my aunt, " and her husband too ! "
  I echoed it, parted from my aunt, went lightly down stairs, mounted,
and rode away. There was greater reason than before to do what I had
resolved to do.
   How well I recollect the wintry ride! The frozen particles of ice,
brushed from the blades of grass by the wind, and borne across my face ;
the hard clatter of the horse's hoofs, beating a tune upon Lhe ground;
the stiff-tilled soil ; the snow-drift, l~ghtlyeddying in the chalk-pit as the
breeze ruffled i t ; the smoking team wlth the waggon of old hay, stopping
to breathe on the hlll-top, and shaking their bells musically; the whitened
slopes and sweeps of Down-land lying against the dark sky, as if they
wcre drawn on a huge slate !
   I found Agnes alone. The little girls had gone to their own homes
now, and she was alone by the fire, readmg. She put down her book on
seeing me come in; and having welcomed me as usual, took her work-
basket and sat in one of the old-fashioned windows.
   I sat beside her on the window-seat, and we talked of what I was doing,
and when it would be done, and of the progress I had made since my last
visit. Agnes was very cheerful ; and laughingly pred~ctedthat I should
soon become too famous to be talked to, on such subjects.
   " So I make the most of the present time, you see," said Agnes, "and

talk to you whlle I may."
   As I looked at her beautiful face, observant of her work, she raised lier
mild clear eyes, and saw that I was looking at her.
   " You are thoughtful to-day, Trotwood ! "

   "Agnes, shall 1 tell you what about? I came to tell you."
   She put aside her work, as she was used to do when we were seriously
discuss~nganyth~ng;and gave me her whole attention.
   "My dear Agnes, do you doubt my being true to you?"
   " No ! " she answered, with a look of astonishment.
   "Do you doubt my being what I always have been to you? "
   " No ! " she answered, as before.
   "Do you remember that I tried to tell you, when I came home, what a
debt of gratitude I owed you, dearest Agnes, and how fervently I felt
towards you ? "
   " I remember it," she said, gently, " very well."
   " You have a secret," said I.       " Let me share it, Agnes."
   She cast down her eyes, and trembled.
   " I could hardly fail to know, even if I had not heard-bot from other
lips than yours, Agnes, which seems strange-that there is some one upon
whom you have bestowed the treasure of your love. Do not shut me out
of what concerns your happiness so nearly ! If you can trust me, as you
say you can, and as I know you may, let me be your friend, your brother,
in this matter, of all others ! "
   With an appealing, almost a reproachful, glance, she rose from the
window ; and hurrying across the room as if without knowing where, put her
hands before her face, and burst into such tears as smote me to the heart.
   And yet they awakened something in me, bringing promise to my heart.

612            THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIEXCE

 Without my knowing why, these tears allied themselves with the quietly
  sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance, and shook me more with
 hope than fear or sorrow.
       Agnes ! Sister ! Dearest ! What have I done ! "
       Let me go away, Trotwood. I am not well. I am not myself. I
 will speak to you by and by-another time. I will write to you. Don't
  speak to me now. Don't ! don't ! "
     I sought to recollect what she had said, when I had spoken to her on that
 former night, of her affection needing no return. I t seemed a very world
 that I must search through in a moment.
       Agnes, I cannot bear to see you so, and think that I have been the
 cause. My dearest girl, dearer to me than anything in life, if you are
 unhappy, let me share your unhappiness. If you are in need of help or
 counsel, let me try to give it to you. If you have indeed a burden on
 your heart, let me Iry to lighten it. For whom do I live now, Bgnes, if
 it is not for you ! "
     " Oh, spare me ! I am not myself! Another time ! " was all I could
 distinguisi.
     Was it a selfish error that was leading me away? Or, having once a
 clue to hope, was there something opening to me that I had not dared to
 think
 .-----~.
       --of?.
     " I must say more.    I cannot let you leave me so ! For Heaven's sake,
 Agnes, let us not mistake each other after all these years, and all that has
 come and gone with them ! I must speak plainly. If you have any lingering
 thought that I could envy the happiness you will confer ; that I could not
 resign you to a dearer protector, of your own choosing; that I could not,
 from my removed place, be a contented witness of your joy; dismiss it,
 for I don't deserve i t ! I have not suEeered quite in vain. You have not
 taught me quite in vain. There is no alloy of self in what I feel for you."
     She was quiet now. In a little time, she turned her pale face towards
 me, and said in a low voice, broken here and there, but very clear,
     " I owe it to your pure friendship for me, Trotwood-which, indeed,
 I do not doubt-to tell you, you are mistaken. I can do no more. I f
 I have sometimes, in the course of years, wanted help and counsel, they
have come to me. If I have sometimes been unhappy, the feeling has
passed away. If I have ever had a burden on my heart, it has been
lightened for me. If I have any secret, it is-no new one ; and is-not
what you suppose. I cannot reveal it, or divide it. It has long been
mine, and must remain mine."
    " Agnes ! Stay ! A moment ! "

    She was going away, but I detained her. I clasped my arm about her
waist. " I n the course of years ! " " I t is not a new one ! " Nerv
thoughts and hopes were whirling through my mind, and all the colors of
my life were changing.
    " Dearest Agnes ! Whom I so respect and honor-whom         I so devotedly
love! When I came here to-day, I thought that nothing could have
wrested this confession from me. I thought I could have kept it in my
bosom all our lives, till we were old. But, Agnes, if I have indeed any
new-born hope that I may ever call you something more than Sister,
widely different from Sister ! -"

614           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

the moon was shining ; A p e s with her quiet eyes raised up to i t ; I
following her glance. Long miles of road then opened out before my
mind; and, toihng on, I saw a ragged way-worn boy, forsaken and neglected,
who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine, his own.

   It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt.
She was up in my study, Peggotty said: which it was her pride to keep
in readiness and order for me. We found her, in her spectacles, sitting by
the fire.
   " Goodness me ! " said my aunt, peering through the dusk, " who 'S
this you 're bringing home ? "
    " Agnes," said I.
   As nre had arranged to say nothing at first, my aunt was not a little dis-
comfited. She darted a hopeful glance at me, when I said " Agnes ;" but
seeing that I looked as usual, she took off her spectacles in despair, and
rubbed her nose with them.
    She greeted Agnes heartily, nevertheless ; and we were soon in the
lighted parlor down stairs, at dinner. My aunt put on her spectacles
twice or thrice, to take another look at me, but as often took them off
again, disappointed, and rubbed her nose with them. Much to the dis-
comfiture of Mr. Dick, who knew this to be a bad symptom,
    "By the by, aunt," said I, after dinner; " I have been speaking to
Agnes about what you told me."
    "Then, Trot," said my aunt, turning scarlet, "you did wrong, and
broke your promise."
    "You are not angry, aunt, I trust? I am sure you won't be, when
you learn that Agnes is not unhappy in any attachment."
    " Stuff and nonsense ! " said my aunt.

    As my aunt appeared to be annoyed, I thought the best way was to cut
her annoyance short. I took Agnes in my arm to the back of her chair,
and we both leaned over her. My aunt, with one clap of her hands, and
one look through her spectacles, immediately went into hysterics, for the
first and only time in all my knowledge of her.
   The hysterics called up Peggotty. The moment my aunt was restored,
she flew at Peggotty, and calling her a silly old creature, hugged her with
all her might. After that, she hugged Mr. Dick (who was highly honored,
but a good deal surprised) ; and after that, told them why. Then, we were
all happy together.
   I could not discover whether my aunt, in her last short conversation
with me, had fallen on a pions fraud, or had really mistaken the state of
my mind. It was quite enough, she said, that she had told me Agnes
was going to be married; and that I now knew better than any one how
true it was.

   We were married within a fortnight. Traddles and Sophy, and Doctor
and Mrs. Strong, were the only guests at our quiet wedding. We left
them full of joy; and drove away together. Clasped i n my embrace,
I held the source of every worthy aspiration I had ever had ; the centre
of myself, the circle of my life, my own, my wife; my love of whom was
founded on a rock !
                       OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.

   "Dearest husband ! " said Agnes. " Now that I may call you by that
name, I have one thing more to tell you."
   "Let me hear it, love."
   "It grows out of the night when Dora died. She sent you for me."
   " She did."
     She told me that she left me something. Can you think what it was ? "
   I believed I could. I drew the wife who had so long loved me, closer
to my side.
   " She told me that she made a last request to me, and left me a last

charge."
   " And it was-"
   'cThat only I would occupy this vacant place."
   And Agnes laid her head upon my breast, and wept; and I wept with
her, though we were so happy.




                          CIfilPTER LXIII.
                               A VISITOR.

   WHATI have purposed to record is nearly finished ; but there is yet
a n incident conspicuous in my memory, on which it often rests with
delight, and without which one thread in the web I have spun, would
have a ravelled end.
   I had advanced in fame and fortune, my domestic joy was perfect, I
had been marrird ten happy years. Agnes and I were sitting by the fire,
in our house in London, one night in spring, and three of our children
were playing in the room, when I was told that a stranger wished to
 see me.
   He had been asked if he came on business, and had answered No; he
had come for the pleasure of seeing me, and had come a long way. H e
was an old man, my servant said, and loolted like a farmer.
   As this sounded mysterious to the children, and moreover was like the
beginning of a favorite story Agnes used to tell them, introductory to
the arrival of a wicked old Fairy in a cloalc who hated every body, it
produced some commotion. One of our boys laid his head in his mother's
lap to be out of harm's way, and little Agnes (our eldest child) left her
doll in a chair to represent her, and thrust out her little heap of golden
curls from between the window-curtains, to see what happened next.
    " Let him come in here ! " said I.
   There soon appeared, pausing in the dark doorway as he entered, a
hale, grey-haired old man. Little Agnes, attracted by his looks, had run
to bring him in, and I had not yet clearly seen his face, when my wife,
starting up, cried out to me, in a pleased and agitated voice, that it was
Mr. Peggotty !
616            THE PERSONBL HISTORY AND         EXPERIENCE

    I t was Mr. Peggotty. An old man now, but in a ruddy, hearty, strong
old age. M'hen our first emotion was over, and he sat before the fire
with the children on his lmees, and the blaze shining on his face, he
looked, to me, as vigorous and robust, withal as handsome, an old man,
as ever I had seen.
    " Mas'r Davy," said he. And the old name in the old tone fell so
naturally on my ear ! " Mas'r Davy, 'tis a joyful hour as I see you, once
more, 'long with your own trew wife 1 "
    " A joyful hour indeed, old friend! " cried I.
    " And these beer pretty ones," said Mr. Peggotty. " To look at these
heer flowers ! Why, Mas'r Davy, you was but the heighth of the littlest of
these, when I first see you ! When Em'ly warn't no bigger, and our poor
lad were but a lad ! "
    " Time has changed me more than it has changed you since then," said
I. " But, let these dear rogues go to bed ; and as no house in England but
this must hold you, tell me where to send for your luggage (IS the old
 black bag among it, that went so far, I wonder !), and then, over a glass of
Yarmouth grog, we will have the tidings of ten years ! "
    " Are you alone ? " asked Agnes.
    " Yes, ma'am," he said, kissing her hand, " quite alone."
    We sat him between us, not knowing how to give him welcome
enough ; and as I began to listen to his old familiar voice, I could have
 fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling
 niece.
     " I t 'S a mort of water," said Mr. I'eggotty, " fur to come across, and
on'y stay a matter of fower weeks. But water ('specially when 'tis salt)
 comes nat'ral to me; and friends is dear, and I am ]leer.-Which is
verse," said Mr. Peggotty, surprised to find it out, " though I hadn't such
intentions."
     " Are you going back those many thousand miles, so soon?" asked
Agnes.
     " Yes, ma'am," he returned. "I giv the promise to Em'ly, afore I
come away. You see, I doen't grow younger as the years comes round,
and if I hadn't sailed as 'twas, most like I shouldn't never have done 't.
And it 'S allus been on my mind, as I ~ r ~ ucome
                                                st   and see Mas'r Davy and
your own sweet blooming self, in your wedded happiness, afore I got to
be too old."
    H e looked at us, as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently.
Agnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair, that he
might see us better.
    "And now tell us," said I, " everything relating to your fortunes."
    " Our fortuns, Mas'r Davy," he rejoined, " is soon told. We haven't
fared nohows, but fared to thrive. We 've allus thrived. mJe 've worked
as we ought to 't, and maj-be we lived a leetle hard at first or so, but we
have allus thrived. What with sheep-farming, and what with stock-
farming, and what with one thing and what with t'other, we are as well to
do, as well could be. Theer 'S been kiender a blessing fell upon us," said
Mr. Peggotty, reverentially inclining his head, " and we 've done nowt
but prosper. That is, in the long run. If not yesterday, why then to-day.
I f not to-day, why then to-morrow."
                        OF DAVlD COPPERFIELD.

  " And E~nily? " said Agnes and I , both together.
  " Em'ly," said " he, arter you left her, ma'arn-and       I never lleerd her
saying of her prayers at night, t'other side the canvas screen, when we
was settled in the Bush, but what I heerd your name-and arter she and
me lost sight of Mas'r Davy, that theer shining sundown-was that low, at
first, that, if she had know'd then what Mas'r Davy kep from us so kind
and thowtful, 'tis my opinion she 'd have drooped away. But theer
was some poor folks aboard as had illness among 'em, and she took
care of them; and theer was the children in our company, and she
took care of them; and so she got to be busy, and to be doing good, and
that helped her."
    " When did she first hear of i t ? " I asked.

    " I lrep it from her arter I heerd on't," said Mr. Peggotty, "going
on nigh a year. We was living then in a solitary place, but among
the beautifullest trees, and with the roses a covering our Beein to the
roof. Theer come along one day, when I was out a working on the
land, a traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England (I doen't
rightly mind which), and of course we took him in, and giv him to eat
and drink, and made him welcome. We all do that, all the colony over.
I i e 'd got an old newspaper with him, and some other account in print of
the storm. That 'S how she know'd it. When I come home at night, 1
found she know'd it."
     H e dropped his voice as he said these words, and the gravity I so well
remembered overspread his face.
     " Did it change her much?" we asked.
     "Aye, for a good long time," he said, shaking Itis head ; " if not to this
present hour. But I think the solitoode done her good. And she had a
deal to mind in the way of poultry and the like, and minded of it, and
come through. I wonder," he said thoughtfully, "if you could see my
Em'ly now, Nas'r Davy, whether you'd know her! "
     " I s she so altered ? " I inquired.

     " I doen't know. I see her ev'ry day, and doen't know; but, odd-
times, I have thowt so. A slight figure," said Mr. Peggotty, looking at
the fire, " kiender worn ; soft, sorrowful, blue eyes ; a delicate face ; a
pritty head, leaning a little down; a quiet voice and way-timid a'most.
That 'S Em'ly ! "
     We silently observed him as be sat, still looking at the fire.
     G Some thinks," he said, "as her affection was ill-bestowed; some, as

her marriage was broke off by death. No one knows how 'tis. She
 might have married well, a mort of times, 'but, uncle,' she says to me,
   that 'S gone for ever.' Cheerfnl along with me ; retired when others is
 by; fond of going any distance fur to teach a child, or fur to tend a sick
 person, or fur to do some kindness tow'rds a young girl's wedding (and
 she 'S done a many, but has never seen one) ; fondly loving of her uncle ;
 patient; liked by young and old; sowt out by all that has any trouble.
 That 'S Em'ly ! "
     H e drew his hand across his face, and with a half-suppressed sigh looked
 up from the fire.
     " I s Martha with you yet? " I asked.
     G Martha," he replied       got married, Mas'r Davy, in the second year.
618           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

A young man, a farm-laborer, as come by us on his way to market with
hls mas'r's drays-a journey of over five hundred mile, theer and back-
made offers fur to take her fur his wife (wives is very scarce theer), and
then to set up fur their two selves in the Bush. She spoke to me fur to
tell him her trem story. I did. They was married, and they live fower
hundred mile away froin any voices but their own and the singing birds."
   " Mrs. Gummidge? " I suggested.

   I t was a pleasant key to touch, for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst into a
roar of laughter, and rubbed his hands up and down his legs, as he had
been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked
boat.
   " Would you believe it ! " he said.    "Why, someun even made offers
fur to marry her! If a ship's cook that was turning settler, Mas'r Davy,
didn't make offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge, I 'm Gormed-and I
can't say no fairer than that ! "
   I never saw dgnes laugh so. This sudden ecstacy on the part of Mr.
Peggotty was so delightful to her, that she could not leave off laughing;
and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh, and the greater
Mr. Peggotty's ecstacy became, and the more he rubbed his legs.
   "And what did Mrs. Gummidge say?" 1 asked, when I was grave
enough.
    " If you 'l1 believe me," returned Mr. Peggotty, " Missis Gummidge,
'stead of saying ' thank you, I 'm much obleeged to yon, I ain't a going fur
to change my condition at my time of life,' up'd with a bucket as was
standing by, and laid it over that theer ship's cook's head 'till he sung
out for help, and I went in and reskied of him."
   Mr. Peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter, and Agnes and I both
kept him company.
    "But I must say this, for the good creetur," he resumed, wiping his
face when we were quite exhausted ; " she has been all she said she 'd
be to us, and more. She 'S the willingest, the trewest, the honestest-
helping woman, Mas'r Davy, as ever draw'd the breath of life. I have
never know'd her to he lone and lorn, for a single minute, not even when
the colony was all afore us, and we was new to it. And thinking of the
old'un is a thing she never done, I do assure you, since she left
England ! "
   " Now, last, not least, Mr. Micawber," said I.   " H e has paid off every
obligation he incurred here-even to Traddles's bill, you remember, my
dear Agnes-and therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing
well. But what is the latest news of him ? "
   Mr. Peggotty, with a smile, put his hand in his breast-pocket, and
produced a flat-folded, paper parcel, from which he took out, with much
care, a little odd-looking newspaper.
   "You are to unnerstan', Mas'r Davy," said he, "as we have left the
Bush now, being so well to do ; and have gone right away round to Port
Middlebay Harbor, wheer theer 'S what u;e call a town."
   " Mr. Micawber was in the Bush near you? " said I.
    " Bless you, yes," said Mr. Peggotty, "and turned to with a will. I
never wish to meet a better gen'lman for turning to, with a will. I've
seen that theer bald head of his, a perspiring in the sun, Mas'r Davy,
                        OF DAVID     COPPERFIELD.                       619
'till I a'most thowt it would have melted away. And now he's a
Magistrate."
      A Magistrate, eh ? " said I.
    Mr. Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper, where I
read aloud as follows, from the "Port Middlebay Times :"

    "y2     The public dinner to our distinguished fellow-colonist and towns-
man, WILICINSMICAWBER,        ESQUIRE,Port Middlebay District Magistrate,
came off yesterday in the large room of the Hotel, which was crowded t o
suffocation. I t is estimated that not fewer than forty-seven persons must
have been accommodated with dinner at one time, exclusive of the com-
pany i n the passage and on the stairs. The beauty, fashion, and exclu-
siveness of Port Middlebay, flocked to do honor to one so deservedly
esteemed, so highly talented, and so widely popular. Doctor Me11 (of
Colonial Salem-Ilouse Grammar School, Port Middlebay) presided, and
on his right sat the distinguished guest. After the removal of the cloth,
and the singing of Non Nobis (beautifully executed, and in which we were
at no loss t o distinguish the bell-like notes of that gifted amateur,
W ~ L K I NMICAWBER,
             S            ESQUIRE, JUNIOR),     the usual loyal and patriotic
toasts were severally given and rapturously received. Doctor Mell, in a
speech replete with feeling, then proposed ' Our distinguished Guest, the
ornament of our town. May he never leave us but to better himself, and
may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself
impossible ! ' The cheering with which the toast was received defies
description. Again and again it rose and fell, l ~ l t e the waves of
ocean. A t length all was hushed, and WILICINSRIICAWRER,            ESQUIRE,
presented himself to return thanks. Far be it from us, in the present
comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment, to
endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-
flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address ! Suffice it to
observe, that i t was a masterpiece of eloquence ; and that those passages
i n which he more particularly traced his own successful career to its
source, and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals of
ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable to liquidate,
brought a tear into the manliest eye present. The remaining toasts were
DOCTOR     MELL; MRS. MICAWBER(who gracefully bowed her ackno~v-
ledgments from the side-door, where a galaxy of beauty was elevated on
chairs, a t once to witness and adorn the gratifying scenej; MRS.RIDGER
BEGS (late Miss Micawber); MRS. ELL; WILICINS ~ I C A W B E R ,
ESQUIRE, JUNIOR      (who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking
that lie found himself unable to return thanks in a speech, but would do
so, with their permission, in a song) ; MRS. MICAWBER'S FAMILY          (well-
known, it is needless to remark, in the mother-country), &c. &c. &c. A t
the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-
magic for dancing. Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE,          who disported
themselves until Sol gave warning for departure, Wilkins Micawber,
Esquire, Junior, and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena, fourth
daughter of Doctor Mell, were particularly remarkable."

   I was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell, pleased to have
             THE   PERSONAL HISTORY        AND EXPERIENCE

discovered, in these happier circumstances, Mr. Mell, formerly poor
pinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate, when Mr. Peggotty pointing
to another part of the paper, my eyes rested on my own name, and I read
thus :
            "   TO DAVID COPPERFIELD, ESQUIRE,
                        " THE   EMINENT AUTHOR.
  " MY DEAR SIR,
           "Tears have elapsed, since I had an opportunity of ocularly
perusing the lineaments, now familiar to the imaginations of a consider-
able portion of the civilised world.
   "But, my dear sir, though estranged (by the force of circumstances
over which I have had no controul) from the personal society of the
friend and companion of my youth, I have not been unmindful of his
soaring flight. Nor have I been debarred,
                   Though seas between us braid ha' roared,
(BURNS)from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread
before us.
   " I cannot, therefore, allow of the departure from this place of an
individual whom we mutually respect and esteem, without, my dear sir,
taking this public opportunity of thanking you, on my own behalf, and,
I may undertake to add, on that of the whole of the Inhabitants of
Port Middlebay, for the gratification of which you are the ministering
agent.
    " Go on, my dear sir!      You are not unknown here, you are not
unappreciated. Though ' remote,' we are neither c unfriended,' ' melan-
choly,' nor (I may add) 'slow.' Go on, my dear sir, in your Eagle
course ! The Inhabitants of Port Middlebay may at least aspire to watch
it, with delight, with entertainment, with instruction !
    "Among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the globe,
will ever be found, while it has light and life,
                           "The
                                " Eye
                                      " Appertaining to
                                                   'c WILICINSMICAWBER,
                                                          'l Nagistrate."



   I found, on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper, that
Mr. hficawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that Journal.
There was another letter from him in the same paper, touching a bridge ;
there was an advertisement of a collection OF similar letters by him, to be
shortly republished, in a neat volume, " with considerable additions ;"
and, unless I am very much mistaken, the Leading Article was his also.
   We talked much of Mr. Micaurber, on many other evenings while &IT,
Peggotty remained with us. He lived with us during the whole term of
his stay,-which, I think, was something less than a month,-and his
sister and my aunt came to London to see him. Agnes and I parted
from him aboardship, when he sailed; and we shall never part from him
more, on earth.
                        OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.                           621
  But before he left, he went with me to Yarmouth, to see a little tablet
I had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham. While I was
copying the plain inscription for him at his request, I saw him stoop, and
gather a tuft of grass from the grave, and a little earth.
   "For Em'iy," he said, as he put it in his breast.          " I promised,
Mas'r Davy."




                           A LAST RETROSPECT.

   AND now my written story ends. I look back, once more-for the last
time-before I close these leaves.
   I see myself, with Agnes at my side, journeying along the road of life.
I see our children and our friends around us ; and I hear the roar of many
voices, not indiEerent to me as I travel on.
   What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd? La,
these; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question !
   Here is my aunt, in stronger spectacles, an old woman of fourscore
years and more, but upright yet, and a steady walker of sir miles at a
stretch in winter weather.
   Always with her, here comes Peggotty, my good old nurse, likewise in
spectacles, accustomed to do needlework at night very close to the lamp,
but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle, a yard measure
in a little house, and a work-box with a picture of St. Paul's upon
the lid.
   The cheeks and arms of Peggotty, so hard and red in my childish days,
when I wondered why the birds didn't peck her in preference to apples,
are shrivelled now; and her eyes, that used to darken their whole neigh-
bourhood in her face, are fainter (though they glitter still) ; but her rough
forefinger, which I once associated with a pocket nutmeg grater, is just
the same, and when I see my least child catching at it as it totters from
my aunt to her, I think of our little parlor at home, when I could scarcely
walk. My aunt's old disappointment is set right, now. She is godmother
to a real living Betsey Trotwood ; and Dora (the next in order) says she
spoils her.
   There is something bulky in Peggotty's pocket. I t is nothing smaller
than the Crocodile-Book, which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this
time, with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across, but which Peggotty
exhibits to the children as a precious relic. I find it very curious to see
my own infant face, looking up at me from the Crocodile stories; and to
be reminded by it of my old acquaintance Brooks of Sheffield.
   Among my boys, this summer holiday time, I see an old man making
giant kites, and gazing at them in the air, wlth a delight for which there
are no words. IIe greets me rapturously, and whispers, with many nods
622           THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

 and winks, "Trotwood, you will be glad to hear that I shall finish the
 Memorial when I have nothing else to do, and that your aunt 'S the most
 extraordinary woman in the world, sir ! "
   Who is this bent lady, supporting herself by a stick, and showing me a
 countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty, feebly
 contending with a querulous, imbecile, fretful wandering of the mind? She
is in a garden ; and near her stands a sharp, dark, withered woman, with
 a white scar on her lip. Let me hear what they say.
    " Rosa, l have forgotten this gentleman's name."

   Rosa bends over her, and calls to her, " Mr. Copperfield."
    " I am glad to see you, sir. I am sorry to observe you are in mourning.
I hope Time will he good to you ! "
    Her impatient attendant scolds her, tells her I am not in mourning,
bids her look again, tries to rouse her.
    " You have seen my son, sir," says the elder lady. " Are you
reconciled ? "
   Looking fixedly at me, she puts her hand to her forehead, and moans.
Suddenly, she cries, in a terrible voice, " Bosa, come to me. He is dead ! "
Rosa, kneeling at her feet, by turns caresses her, and quarrels with her;
now fiercely telling her, " I loved him better than you ever did ! "--now
soothing her to sleep on her breast, like a sick child. Thus I leave them;
thus I always find them; thus they wear their time away, from year to
year.
    What ship comes sailing home from India, and what English lady is
this, married to a growling old Scotch Crcesus with great flaps of ears.
Can this be Julia Mills?
   Indeed it is Julia Mills, peevish and fine, with a blacli. man to carry
 cards arid letters to her on a golden salver, and a copper-colored woman in
linen, with a bright handkerchief round her head, to serve her Tiffin in her
dressing-room. But Julia keeps no diary in these days; never sings
Affection's Dirge ; eternally quarrels with the old Scotch Crcesus, who is
a sort of yellow bear wlth a tanned hide. Julia is steeped in money to the
throat, and talks and thinks of nothing else. I liked her better in the
Desert of Sahara.
   Or perhaps this i s the Desert of Sahara ! For, though Julia has a stately
house, and mighty company, and sumptuous dinners every day, I see no
green growth near her; nothing that can ever come to fruit or flower.
What Julia calls " society," I see; among it Mr. Jack Maldon, from his
Patent Place, sneering at the hand that gave it him, and speaking to me,
of the Doctor, as " so charmingly antique." But when society is the
name for such hollow gelitlemen and ladies, Julia, and when its breeding
is professed indifference to everything that can advance or can retard
mankind, I think we must have lost ourselves in that same Desert of
Sahara, and had better find the way out.
   And 10, the Doctor, always our good friend, laboring at his Dic-
tionary (somewhere about the letter I)), and happy in his home and wife.
Also the Old Soldier, on a considerably reduced footing, and by no means
so influential as in days of yore !
   Working at his chambers in the Temple, with a busy aspect, and his
                         OF D.4VID    COPPERFIELD.                        623
hair (where he is not bald) made more rebellious than ever by the constant
friction of his lawyer's-wig, I come, in a later time, upon my dear old
Traddles. His table is covered with thick piles of papers; and I say, as
I look around me:
   " If Sophy were your clerk, now, Traddles, she would have enough to

 ..! "
do
    "You may say that, my dear Copperfield ! But those were capital
 days, too, in Holborn Court ! Were they not ? "
    " When she told you you would be a Judge ? But it was not the town

 talk then !"
    " At all events," says Traddles, " if I ever am one-"

    c c Why, you know you will be."
    "Well, my dear Copperfield, when I am one, I shall tell the story, as I
 said I would."
    We walk away, arm in arm. I am going to have a family dinner with
Traddles. I t is Sophy's birthday ; and, on our road, Traddles discourses
 to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed.
    '' I really have been able, my dear Copperfield, to do all that I had
most at heart. There's the Reverend Horace promoted to that living at
four hundred and fifty pounds a year; there are our two boys receiving
the very best education, and distinguishing theinselves as steady scholars
and good fellows ; there are three of the girls married very comfortably ;
there are three more living with us ; there are three more keeping house
for the Reverend Ilorace since Mrs. Crewler's decease ; and all of them
happy ."
    " Except-    " I suggest.
    "Except the Beauty," says Traddles. "Yes. It was very unfortu-
nate that she should marry such a vagabond. But there was a certain
dash and glare about him that caught her. However, now we have
got her safe at our house, and got rid of him, we must cheer her up
again."
    Traddles's house is one of the very houses-or it easily may have
been-which he and Sophy used to parcel out, in their evening walks.
I t is a large house ; but Traddles keeps his papers in his dressing-room,
and his boots with his papers ; and he and Sophy squeeze themselves into
upper rooms, reserving the best bed-rooms for the Beauty and the girls.
There is no room to spare in the house ; for more of " the girls" are here, and
always are here, by some accident or other, than I know how to count. Here,
when we go in, is a crowd of them, running down to the door, and hand~ng
Traddles about to be kissed, until he is out of breath. Here, established
in perpetuity, is the poor Beauty, a widow with a little girl; here,
at dinner on Sophy's birthday, are the three married girls with their
three husbands, and one of the husband's brothers, and another hus-
band's cousin, and another husband's sister, who appears to me to be
engaged to the cousin. Traddles, exactly the same simple, unaffected
fellow as he ever was, sits at the foot of the large table llke a Patr~arch;
and Sophy beams upon him, from the head, across a cheerful space that is
certainly not glitter~ngwith Britannia metal.
    And now, as I close my task, subduing my desire to linger yet, these
faces fade away. But, one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by
which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them all. And
that remains.
   I turn my head, and see it, in its beautiful serenity, beside me. My
lamp burns low, and I have written far into the night; but the dear
presence, without whicli I were nothing, bears me company.
   0 Agnes, 0 my soul, so may thy face be by me when I close my life
indeed ; so may I, when realities are melting from me like the shadows
whicli I now dismiss, still find thee near me, pointing upward !




                                THE END.

  I   DO   not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this
Book, i n the first sensations of having finished it, to refer to it
with the composure which this formal heading ~vouldseem to
require.    My interest in it, is so recent and strong; and my
mind is so divided between pleasure and regret-pleasure          in
the achievement of a long design, regret in the separation
from many companions-that        I am in danger of wearying the
reader whom I love, with personal confidences, and private
emotions.

  Besides which, all that I could say of the Story, to any
purpose, I have endeavoured to say in it.

  It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how
sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years'
imaginative task; or how an Author feels as if he were dis-
missing some portion of himself into the shadowy world, when
a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for
ever. Yet, I have nothing else to tell ; unless, indeed, I were
to confess (which might be of less moment still) that no one
can ever believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I
have believed it in the writing.

  Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I
cannot close this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a
hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again put forth
my two green leaves once a month, and with a faithful remem-
brance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these
leaves of David Copperfield, and made me happy.

                  THE RAILROAD OF LIFE.


          BY THE AUTHOR OF "FRANK FAIRLEGH."

                              DIRECTORS' REPORT.
   INthrowing open to the Public the " RAILROADOF LIFE," the head Director (who
 unites in his own persoil the offices of Chairman, Secretary, Engineer, Contractor, Station-
master, Engine-driver, Stoker, Poker-in short, every thing except Book-keeper) craves
permission to report a few of the difficulties he has had to overcome, to account for the
line he has chosen, and to set forth the present prospects of the undertaking.
   The journey from the cradle to the grave is, proverbially, a very up-hill affair. I n the
old coaching days, a certain tip-top dragsman, who knew more of the road, and handled the
ribbons in better style than any brother of the craft with whom your Director is acquainted,
-one Will Shakspeare, known (probably from the name of some public-house which he
frequented) by the sodripuet of "The Swan of Avon," was accustomed to divide the
journey into seven stages. I n regard to the first two of these, your Directol; deeming them
a bore, thought fit to get through them by means of a tunnel; you are, therefore, kept in
the dark till the third stage commences. This, known as Love Lane, or the Course of True
Love, presented immense difficulties; for, in the memory of man, it "never did run smooth,"
and even the "ironing " and " mangling" necessary to the formation of a railroad, have failed
to reduce every rough place. For the exact method in which each difficulty has been met,
your Director begs to recommend AN EARLY INSPECTION OF THE WORK ITSELF, which, he
confidently trusts, will not disappoint your expectations. The latter stages, presenting
fewer points of interest, are passed over as quickly as possible; and the scene at the
Terminus being of a decidedly "grave" character, that part of the "uiidertaking" has been
left chiefly to the imagination.
   I n regard to the particular line which he has chosen, your Director has been actuated by
a desire to reach the proposed end as swiftly and easily as possible, hoping by a judicious
management of the principal (ple?) intrusted to him, to secure the greatest amount of
interest for the Subscribers.
   To conclude, your Director has much pleasure in informing you, that he considers the
prospects of the "RAILROAD       OF LIFE" most encouraging : every one must, in the course of
their existence, take the journey ; and if every one takes it, the Railroad must answer.
   The Capital (Contents and Illustrations) is in at least 30,000 Shares of 1s. each; and
 for all further particulars, your Director begs to refer you to

   Now, in the same proportion as any people forming a Nation develope their com-

render it necessary that its inhabitants should not only become acquainted with the
Topographical and Geographical features, relative distances and bearings, of their
own and neighbouring nations, but of every portion of the known world, even
extending their researches to unknown regions. Indeed, no member of a commercial
nation, especially in one where education is much diffused, is qualified to act his
part aright as one of its people, unless he is able to form a tolerably accurate notion
of the names of Nations, Places, Seas, Rivers, Mountains, &C., their relative position
and extent, as well as to learn how richly the Creator of the Earth has endowed
them all with the means of ministering to those comforts and pleasures, of which man
in every state of society and climate so much stands in need.
   These reflections might be much extended, but the limits of a prospectus will not
permit it, suffice it to say that every Englishman, be he rich or poor, should have
access t o modern Maps of the various portions of the World, in order to possess the
means of cultivating a knowledge of its divisions, the names of the chief Nations,
Places, &C., &C., as well as to be able to form intellectual and comrnercial ideas
of its numerous products, and the respective regions from whence come the
countless varieties of foreigo substances now in use among us as articles of ornament
or necessity.
   Now, though a Modern Atlas of the World is so essential to every family in this
kingdom, still it has been almost limited in its possession, on account of the high price
a t which all really gocd and practical works have hitherto been issued. To remove
this difficulty has been the principal motive which has induced the Proprietors of
" PHILIPS'PENNYMODERN          ATLAS"t o issue a work which they feel satisfied will be

         IMPROVED TRANSPARENT TRACING PAPER,
    Warranted of the very best material.    Samples will be sent free, upon a ~ l i c a t i o n .
   The following extracts from the "Art Union," and "Magazine of Science," will be sufficient
guarantee of the excellent quality of these papers, and the great celebrity to which they have attained :
    Art Union.-"Messrs. Waterlow and Sons' Tracing Paper is certainly the best we have ever tried, being per-
fectly transparent, though sufficientlythick for all practical purposes, and perfectly free from that oiliness we
generally meet with in paper of a similar description, taking the ink as readily as ordinary writing paper. I t
must be invaluable to all who require the use of such an article!'
    Magazine of Science.-" To those very numerous classes of the public-artists, architects,engineers, map-makers
pattern-drawers-indeed to all who, whether professionallyor otherwise, have occasion to employ tracingpape~
we would, with earnestness, urge the extreme worth and merits of that manufactured by Messrs. Waterlow and
Sons. In happy contrast to the paper of a like nature, too frequently to be met with, theirs is entirely devoid of
all nasty, unclean greasiness; it is thoroughly transparent, and can be traced over either by the pencil, or-a great
desideratum-by pen and ink. Assuredly this is a very admirable article."

   The increasing demand for these Presses, and the great satisfaction which they have universally
given, have induced us to manufacture a large stork of the most useful sizes; we are therefore
enabled to offer them at much lower prices than heretofore ; the large sale which they have met with
has convinced us of the impolicy of endeavouring to maintain the old and extravagant scale of prices
charged at a time when it was the exception, instead of as at present the rule, for every Counting-
house or Gentleman's Library to be furnished witli a Copying Machine. These Machines, although
lower i n price than those o f a n y other manufacturer, are all warranted, and will be immediately
exchanged, or the money returned, if any fault is discovered.

TO THE STATUE ON BLOOMSBURY CHURCH.
 E x c u s s my boldness, elevated Statue!             At this vast mart-the glory of the West-
 And learn why thus my pen i s pointed a t you.        Dress is dlsplay'd, the cheapest and the best.
 A mighty change-a wonderful reality-                  You must have seen, from your exalted spire,
 Has lately taken place in your locality.              What MOSEShere has shown us in attire.
 Improvement's wand, with pantomimic touch,            You also must have seen the crowds that press
 Has bid new scenes arise, and alter'd much            To purchase Messrs. MOSES'Winter Dress.
 That thickly peopled district where your pile         Never was such a stirring scene display'd
 Has firmly stood for such a length of while.          At any previous opening in the trade.
 Look down and see how great a work i s done,          The Braoch DBpbt, so near your noble church,
 Nor fail to view the mart of M. and S O N ;           Has never once been left, as in the lurch.

that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or, i t is the same concern, has been
resorted to i n many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion withany
other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 506,507, and 508, New Oxford
Street, and 2 and 3, Hart Street ; 36, Fargate, Sheffield ; and 19, Thornton's Buildings, Bradford,
Yorkshire ; and those who desire cheap and genuine Clothing, &C., should call at or send to the Minories
and Aldgste (opposite the Church), City, London ; or to the Branch Establishments as above.

     The Establishments are closed from sunset, Friday, till sunset, Saturday, when business
                                    is resumed till 12 o'clock.
