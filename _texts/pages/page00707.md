THE HOUSEHOLD NARRAT                 OF


                   CURRENT EVENTS.
                              CONDUCTED BY


            CHARLES DICKENS.
                                   BEING A


Monthly Supplement to " Household Words."
       E take this opportunity of announcing a design, closely associated
        with our Household Words, which we have now matured, and which
 we hope will be acceptable to our readers.
    We purpose publishing, at the end of each month as a Supplementary
 Number to the monthly part of Household Words, a comprehensive Abstract

 and price of a single number of '&lt;HOUSEHOLD WORDS."                   Twelve
  umbers will necessarily be published in the course of the year-one for each
 month-and on the completion of the Annual Volume, a copious Index will
 appear, and a title-page for the volume ; which will then be called THE
 HOUSEHOLD    NARRATIVE   of such a year. I t will form a complete Chronicle
 of all that year's events, carefully compiled, thoroughly digested, and sys-
 tematically arranged for easy reference ; presenting a vast mass of infor-
 mation that must be interesting to all, at n price that will render it
 accessible to the humblest purchasers of books, and at which only our
 existing machinery in connexion with our Weekly TvIiscellany would enable
us to produce it.
   The first number of THE HOUSEHOLD          NARRATIVE     will appear as a
Supplement to the first monthly part of " Household Words," published a t
the end of the present month of APRIL, AS the Volume for 1850 would be
incomplete (in consequence of our not having commenced this publication
at the beginning of a year) without a backward reference to the three
