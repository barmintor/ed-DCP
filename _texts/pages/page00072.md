I   ANALYSIS O F THE NAME O F M O S E S & SON.

!      ITis not a little interesting to notice the many recommendatory nouns and adjectives which bear as their
    initial characters the letters composing the name of MOSES& SON. For instance : the letter '&M*at
    once reminds of (M)atchless (M)ake and (M)agnificent (M)aterial.-The               letter " 0 " is displayed in
    (0)ut-and-(0)ut (O)vercaats, (0)btainable (0)pposite the Church.-The               letter " S " is the initial
    character of the words (S)trength, S)martness, (S)tyle, and (S)uitability.-The           letter L 6 E "will be
    found in (E)ronomy, (E)uellence, [P)gnity, (E)xchange, and (S)o on.
       The A " in the conjunction whispers of (A)dmirable (A)rticies (A)dapted to ( ~ ) 1 1 . - ~ ~ ~ in     , " the
    same word, will show itself in (=)one so (N)oted as this (N)otorious (=)sine in trade.-The        letter "D lS
    calls to mind (D)urable (D)ress, (D)elicate ( ~ ) e s i g n ,and (D)ispatch.
       The word SON, it is true, furnishes us with the very same letters as we have just pointed out; but,
    notwithstanding, there will be no difficulty in finding new footsteps to tread in.
       A (S)lap-up (S)uit, for instance, at once gives us the letter "S " over again ;as do also the words
    (S)howrooms, (S)hawls, (S)carfs, (S)ilks, (S)atins, (S)hifts, and (S)o forth.-The             character "0,"
    again, speaks of (O)utfits, (O)xonians, and (0)ther similar article~.-~'W," in eouclusion, appears in
     (Nleatness, (N)icety, and (N)eglect in (W)othing, at the celebrated House of that Firm whose name
    has been thus truthfully analysed.
