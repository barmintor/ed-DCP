   "King Arthur aims a t relating one of the most fascinating of all national and chivalrous legends. It is a
valuable addition t o the poetical treasures of 0111 language, and we regard it a s not only worthy, but likely t o
take its place among those fine though not faultless performances, which will hereafter represent t h e poetical
literature of England in the first half of the nineteenth century. T h e author is, we think, right i n believing
this t o be the least perishable monument of his genius."-Edinbwrgh    Review.
