   HYDROPATHIC E S T A B L I S H M E N T ,
                   SUDBROOK PARK, NEAR RICHMOND, SURREY.

 THISInstitution, which has been in full and successful operation for eight years, is conducted by JAMES
ELLIS,
    M.D., who resides in the house, and has thus the opportunity of exercising a constant superintend-
ence of the treatment.
    During a lengthened residence a t Grafenburg, Dr. ELLIShad peculiar opportunities of studying the
principles and practice of the Water Cure, under Vincent Priessnitz, who has recommended patients return-
ing to England to place themselves under his care ; added to which, he has made a personal inspection of
the first establishments on the Continent and in England.
    His own experience during a practice of eight years, part of which h e was a coadjutor of Dr. Weiss,
enables him confidently to assert, that all diseases curable, and many incurable by any previously known
means, can be safely and successfully treated by a proper application of the Water Cure alone.
    Sudbrook Park adjoins Richmond Park on its southern and sheltered side, and contains upwards of a
hundred acres. It is richly wooded, and the pleasure grounds are extensive and beautiful, containing
many appliances for the recreation and exercise of the patients. I t is also within five minutes' walk of
the most beautiful part of the river Thames, which is accessible for the amusements of boating and fishing.
     B y special permission of the Queen, there is also a private access to the Royal Park of Richmond.
    T h e air is celebrated for its purity, and the soil being composed of gravel, is peculiarly dry and healthy,
allowing the exercise of walking at all seasons.
     T h e Mansion is admirably adapted for the purpose, the rooms being lofty and spacious. I t was formerly
t h e residence of the Dukes of Argyll and Buccleuch.

     T h e house is abundantly supplied with the purest water, including, among other sources, the celebrated
Silver spring which takes its rise in Richmond Park,* and the Plunge Baths, Douches, &c,, are fitted u p
