                         M Y SEA-SIDE TRIP.
                                              __e_
  I CANNOT look hack on the past month or two without feelings of considerable pleasure.
   My stay by the sea-side not only replenished my health, but also afforded me many opportunities of
making useful and interesting observations. The difference of character is one thing which I cannot
pass by without observation in such scenes and on such occasions.
   The leisure which I had at command gave me an opportunity of noticing this diversity of character.
But I could not help remarking that one general rule in point of fashion seemed to influence all parties.
   For instance, previously to my taking up my marine abode, I gave E. MOSES& SON a n order for
various requisites in Summer attire, which order was executed greatly to the credit of the Proprietors, and
greatly to the satisfaction of myself.
   On arriving at my destination, and mingling, as I did, with the klite at the Watering-place where I had
chosen to stay, I found that the fashion and make of my dress were precisely the same as those of the
principal part of the visitors.
   E. MOSES& SON, I found, had been the Tailors selected by these parties, who know well how to make
a judicious selection in such matters as attire.
   I was highly pleased at the result of my observations, and I determined not to let Moses & SONbe the
losers. So long as Watering-places have visitors, and so long as fashion is an object in such circles as
frequent these retreats, so long will I purchase my dress of MOSES& SON. I understand that their
present stock is of the most admirable description, and, as the Autumn is here, I shall go for a suit where
I went previously to taking my sea-side trip.
