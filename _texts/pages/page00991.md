              DANIEL LAMBERT'S SUIT.
SOMEWHERE      in Lincolnshire, no matter where-        A wondrous change in trade has come t o pass
(For that, In fact, IS nelther here nor there,)         Since Danlel Lambert stood before hrs glass.
I saw what I had never seen before-                     Monopoly, since Danlel wore his clothes
The very snlt which Danlel Lambert wore:                Has heen deprlved of that by which he rise.
And I confess that ~ t enormous

Was such as made me open both my eyes.                  As hold reformers in the sphere of trade:
I n fact, as long as my inspection lasted,              What would huge Daulel say, lf 11vlng now !
I stood and stared, completely flabbergasted.           And what surprise would l ~ fh18t lofty brow,
" Dear me, (I thought,) the celebrated Dan              If he could see what Mosss' famed Depat,
Must, sure, have heen a most prod~giousman!"            In all ~ t various
                                                                   s       articles could show I
The glant suit of whlch I made inspect~on               The present autumn dress, could he but see.
Brought MOSES'warehouse to my recollection.             Would please huge Daniel, as it pleases me.
The famed " Gol~athgarments" I survey'd,                Nor would the g ~ a n rue
                                                                               t h18 vlslt paid
And thought of what ~mprovementshad been made,          To MOSES'mart-the @ant of the trade.

   CAUTION.-E. MOSES & S O N regret having to guard the public against imposition, but having heard
that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or, it is the same concern, has been
resorted to i n many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion with any
other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 36, Fargate, Sheffield, and 19,
Thornton's Buildings, Bradford, Yorkshire ; and those who desire cheap and genuine Clothing, $C., should
call a t or send to the Minories and Aldgate (opposite the Church), City, London ; or to the Branch
Establishments as above.
