                                THE DOG-DAYS.
     THEREis a particular Star which philosophers call a Canicular Star, or Dog-Star, which Star, i n its rising
 and setting, determines what we call the Dog-days, now about commencing.
     I t can hardly be considered as descending to dog-grel when E. MOSESand SONsay,
                                               "Let the Dog-days
                                                Be ligbt-' tog ' days."
     The oppressive heat which almost invariably distinguishes this season of the year renders a light coo1
 description of dress absolutely necessary; and E. MOSESand SONhave no wish t o be dog-matical when they
say that positively their Summer Over-coats and other Dress, are the choicest articles that can be purchased.
 If the present Stock of Summer Over-coats, in Alpaca and other materials, are compared, in quality and price.
 with those which used to be worn some years ago, it will be seen what good E. Mosas and SONhave effected.
     Since E. lMosas & SONem-barked in trade, Monopoly has had t o bark in vain for support.
     His dog.ged obstinacy in high prices has availed him nothing ; his full gallop in trade has become a mere
dog-trot, and, the dog has had his day.
     He no longer cuts a "Dash" in business; his styles be-"Tray" him ; and he is obliged t o sneak away like
a dog with his tail burnt. E. MOSES&Son have proved Monopoly to be like the dogin themanger, begrudging
all parties a portion of advantage in his transactions. Like the dog, however, in other fable, he grasped a t a
shadow and lost the substance; which substance E. MOSESand SONflatterthemselves they have long enjoyed
i n the shape of an unprecedented amount of public countenance and support.
