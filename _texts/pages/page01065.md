faces fade away. But, one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by
which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them all. And
that remains.
   I turn my head, and see it, in its beautiful serenity, beside me. My
lamp burns low, and I have written far into the night; but the dear
presence, without whicli I were nothing, bears me company.
   0 Agnes, 0 my soul, so may thy face be by me when I close my life
indeed ; so may I, when realities are melting from me like the shadows
whicli I now dismiss, still find thee near me, pointing upward !




                                THE END.
