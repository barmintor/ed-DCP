WORDS." Twelve numbers will necessarily be published in
the course of the year-one for each month-and on the com-

HOUSEHOLD     NARRATIVE   of such a year. I t will form a complete
Chronicle of all that year's events, carefully compiled, thoroughly
digested, and systematically arranged for easy reference ; pre-
