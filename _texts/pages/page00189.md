       BESIDES the above Patented Article of Dress (called THE NIUOLL), there is
     another Novelty introduced for this Season, which is, however, Registered under the
     name of NICOLL'S MORNING COAT, it being especially intended for morning
     wear, in riding or walking exercise, when it necessarily avoids the stiff formality to
     be observed in the cut and form of the dress-coat. The price is TWO GUlNEAS.




       .--
          The premises (extending from 114 to 120, Regent Street), as illuminated in honour of
                              Her Majesty's and the Prince's Birthdays.
    T H E REGISTERED PALETOT is now ready for the Spring Months, with all
 the new and patented improvements, included in the moderate price of Two
 GUINEAS. Thus it deservedly bears the name of being not only the most fashionable,
 but also the cheapest and most durable garment ever offered to the public; the
 intrinsic value of the material known as NICOLLIAN, or LLAMA CLOTH, being,
 within the last few months, much enhanced ; the same durability being retained,
 with an increased fineness and beauty in appearance. I t can be seen, ready for
 immediate wear, in every size, at the Patentees' Warerooms.
