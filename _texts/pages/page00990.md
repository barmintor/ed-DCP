                                 Numerous Subscribers having expressed a desire to have the whole
                              of ELIZACOOK'S P O E M Sreprinted in the JOURNAL,     we have much
                              pleasure in announcing that a re-issue will be commenced in the
                              F I R S T NUMBER of the FOURTHVOLUME, to be published Novem-
                              ber and, and continued weekly until completed.
                                                          ---+---
                                This JOURNAL      is distinguished from purely scientific and
                          literary periodicals by partaking of the character of both. I n
                          the belief that the heart needs to be educated to the full as
                          much as the head, the constant aim has heen t o appeal to the
                          feelings as well as to the intellect. Prominence is given to none
                          but the higher and tenderer feelings of humanity.
                              The past numbers contain many contributions by long-
                          established Writers-Tales, Poetry, and Essays-all nearly
                          concerning the happiness and prosperity of the People.

                          provided, fitted for the pure minds and quick perceptions of
                          Childhood; and "Diamond Dust," consisting of quaint, witty,
                          and concise definitions and adages, has heen selected and
                          written with great care.
                                                     --
                              The above a~rangementwill not interfere with the present
                          features of the JOURNAL,  and Subscribers will thus obtain, at
                          a trifling cost, the WHOLE OR THE POEMS written before the
                          commencement of the JOURNAL.
