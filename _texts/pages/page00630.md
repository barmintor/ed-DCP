                     A SKETCH FOR T H E SPRING.
                                                        ___e_

     How cheering is the dawn of Spring !                               Cast not your winter dress aside.
     What happy thoughts its moments bring;                             How often has the first fine day
     The balmy freshness of its breeze                                  Caused people to he led astray I
     The welcome budding of the tree:                                   Mosss' will soon before you bring
     The sun beams peeping from the cioud                               Their dresses for the coming spring.
     Which lately formed a snowy shroud                                 Meanwhile they 'd have you not forget
     The opening flower, the warbling hiid,                             The clothing which they furnish yet.
     Are gladly seen and gladly heard.                                  The cold March winds you all should shun
     Not only in the country-scene                                      With Wrappers made by M. &SON.
     Has spring its charms-where all is green-                          When next upon this printed sheet
     But in the town and City, too,                                     The name of MOSES'mart you meet,
     A change in every thing we view.                                   My muse will touch her trading lyre
     While all our hopes are on the wing                                In praise of Moses' spring attire,
     To meet the welcome, smiling spring;                               Which thousands buy and all admire.
     But here a hint may be supplied,
