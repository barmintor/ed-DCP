                  ~ SMOSES'Warehouse press ;                          Although the articles they sell
      And pray what makes them go s o ?                                Are any thing but " So-so."
    Because the articles of dress
      Are any thing but I' So-so."                                    Monopoly they thus attack,
                                                                       And while they face the foe so,
    The dress is good-the dress is smart-                             He feels constrain'd to turn his back,
     And all the buyers know so ;                                      And own himself hut " So-so."
    And not a thing at MOSES'mart
     Is ever viewed as "So-so."                                       Come, then, and swell the list of those
                                                                        Who aid the vast Dep6t so.
   No one in reason can suppose                                       And purchase Moses' new &ring clothes.
      That public aid would flow so,                                   So opposite t o "So-so."
   If Messrs. M o s ~ s i ntheir clothes
      Were any thing like " So-so."                                   If you, in point of dress, are one
                                                                         That's called a virtuoso
   Mosss and SON are cheap as well,                                   Right pleased you'll be wiih M. and SON,
    And all their prices show so,                           I            Whose dress is never "So-so."
