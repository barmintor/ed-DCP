      THE POWDERED-HEADED GENTLEMAN.

  I S C A R C E need tell, what ev'ry one must know,             The cloth was elegant, the style "all right''
  That powder'd heads wt3rcone time "all the go: "                (To use the homely phrase of Mr. Whltej)
  Such wa9 Ihc case: and not to have a snuw head                 And so delighted was the powder'd man
  Was almost tantamount to having no head.                        Wlth garments made on such a first-rate plan,
  I n fact, a man without a dusty " n a b ''                     That he began to fear that powder'd haw
  Was scarce view'd higher than a ' I Dusty Bob."                Would be a most destructive thlng to wear.
  But heads no loneer are with oowder loaded.                    " Thls coat (thought he,) is far too good to spoll,
  The powder-box Las now, lank slnce, exploded.                  Suppose I change my powder Into 011."
  Yet Mr. White-a man whom well 1 know-                          He thought and thought, tlll on that very day
  Wore uowdrr t i l l a week or t w o aeo.                       HIS powder prlde and prejudice gave way.
                                                                 A fact llke thls you'll readlly confess
                                                                 Speaks volumes for the worth of MOSES'dress.
                                                                 And should the anecdote whlch thus I've told
                                                                 Tempt you to go where Mosss' dress is sold.

  As none could equal-save E. M. and SON.                        At swelling Mosss' tram by means of powder.
