     PATENT LETTER COPYING MACHINES,
     ( T h e working p a r t s manufactured of Steel, a n d jinished w i t h t h e greatest accuracy,)
                              AT CONSIDERABLY          REDUCED       PRICES.




                 SCREW PRESS.                                             LEVER PRESS.
   The increasing demand for these Presses, and the great satisfaction which they have universally
given, have induced us to manufacture a large stork of the most useful sizes; we are therefore
enabled to offer them at much lower prices than heretofore ; the large sale which they have met with
has convinced us of the impolicy of endeavouring to maintain the old and extravagant scale of prices
charged at a time when it was the exception, instead of as at present the rule, for every Counting-
house or Gentleman's Library to be furnished witli a Copying Machine. These Machines, although
lower i n price than those o f a n y other manufacturer, are all warranted, and will be immediately
exchanged, or the money returned, if any fault is discovered.
