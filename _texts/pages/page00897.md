B A L S A M COPAIBA and all other Medicines of a nauseous character
       now be taken without inconvenience, by means of the PATENT FLEXIBLE CAPSULES. These Capsules
will be found superior to those made with Gelatine. They remain entire until they have passed through the
stomach into the intestines ; and the medicine being efficiently brought in contact with the organs it is
intended to affect, the usual nausea and unpleasant eructations are avoided. E ~ A N &

Patentees; and all Medicine Vendors throughout the kingdom.
   *,* The recent discovery that the low priced Gelatine Capsules contain a compound of train and other
oils, and in many cases no Copaiba whatever, renders it important that the public should be made aware
that the PATENT FLEXIBLE CAPSULES are guaranteed t o containgenuine Copaiba only.
