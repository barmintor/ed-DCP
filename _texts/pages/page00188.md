     COME,Father Neptune ! I 'm disposed to be                         I want to ask what thy opinion is
      A little chatty, for a certain reason:                             Of MOSES'Mart, so famed in this dominion?
     Thou knowest well, as monarch of the sea,                         I know thou art a tolerable quiz,
      That this is what I l l term " a ducking season,"                  Well capable of forming an opinion :
     When multttudes of Britain's sons and dauehters                   Thou'st seen what Messrs. MOSEShave been at. Sir.
/I   Recruit their health and strength beside thy waters.          I   And, therefore, hast thy notion, this or that, Sir.
                                                                                                                               II
