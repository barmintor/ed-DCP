       THE G R E A T E S T L U X U R Y
                     FOR THE BED-ROOM IS

T B E E I D E R - D O W N QUILT.
   IDER-DOWN contains the most warmth, with the least weight, of
E    any known substance; and this, combined with its freedom from
Stem or Quill, renders it, either for a Bed covering,
 OR AS A WRAPPER FOR THE COUCH OR CARRIAGE,
more agreeable,
                  AND ALSO MORE HEALTHFUL,
than any other covering.

  The EIDER-DOWN QUILT is strongly recommended by the most
eminent members of the faculty for the
    AGED AND INFIRM, AS WELL AS FOR INVALIDS.
  They are kept, in great variety of sizes and colours, and in Silk and
Cotton cases.
