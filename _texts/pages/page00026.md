and policies thereonissued, the annual premiums on which amount t o 3 2 4 , 4 7 5 5s. ad. ; 137 more havebeenaccepted,
but the policies have not been completed; the remaining 113 proposals the directors have deemed it prudent
to decline.
   The annual income has increased to 6 1 2 6 , 2 3 2 7 s . 6 d . , notwithstanding the reduction on premiums, amounting to
the sum of %10,716 3s. 6d., allowed to those members who choose this mode of appropriating the profits.
   The total amount of bonuses assigned in 1847, to policies on which the original prenliums continue to be paid,
is 837,834 4s., in addition to the sums assigned in 1842.
   The accounts to the 20th November last have been duly audited ; the balance of receipts over disbursements for
the gear is 6 7 2 , 8 5 5 19s. 3d., making the capital stock of the Institution a t that date &440,028 15s. Sd., which i s
invested in real and government securities.
   The sums paid for claims on policies of deceased members from the commencement of the Institution, including
the bonuses assigned thereto, amount to 8 1 1 1 , 3 3 9 10s. I d . , of which, 8 1 6 , 2 6 0 10s. has been paid within the last
twelve months, and the sum of 6 7 , 7 4 9 , not yet applied for, remains due on Lhis account.
   The foregoing summary, exhibiting such successful results in the short space of thirteen pears, attests both the

payable at death.
