        THE LADY A N D T H E PEACOCK.
  PEACOCKS,    you know, can use their tongues in fable,    "Nay (said the lady,) outward show or not,
  And ladies are on all occasions able.                     I prize you for it-and I tell you what-
  I mention thii by way of introduction                     You would not meet with quite so much respect
  To sometbing for amusement and instruction.               But for the plumes in whlch you now are deck'd.
  A sweet young lady, of the name of Nancy,                 'Tis dress, my pretty bird, you'll bear in mind
  Kept a fine peacock by the way of fancy:                  Does just the same with you as with mankind:"
  Who, thus, one day (positively begging pardon,)
  Address'd his fair young mistress in her garden :-                            APPLICATION.
  " I 'Ve very often, Madam, wish'd t o know                Learn, gentle reader, from this simple fable,
  What is the reason that vou nrize me so.                  To dress yourself as well as you are able;
  I cannot crow, nor can ~ . e v e i - c ~ u e k~--         Nor fail to go to MOSES'noted mart
  Nor quack nor gabble, like a goose Ar dnck-               For articles of clothing good and d a r t .
  My hoarse wild scream is such a s some would hush,        MOSESand SONcan deck you in attire
  Persons might almost think I had the thrush.              Whose quality and beauty all admire.
  I've got a tidy 'rigging-out,' I know,                    Yes-you will win, in dress, by M. and SON
  But, la, dear me! that 'S only outward show."             More admiration than you ever won.
