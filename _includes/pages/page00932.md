        PRINTING XACHINE,
                           BY MEANS OF WHICH

        EVERY PERSON MAY BECOME HIS O W N PRINTER,

   The Process is extremely simple, and thousands of copies may be
produced from any writing, drawing, piece of music, or design
(previously made on paper), and the requisite number of copies
being finished the subject may be effaced and another substituted.
   This Invention will be found of great utility to Railway Companies,
in corresponding with their Stations ; to Joint Stock Banks, for
producing copies of Letters to Branches; to Merchants, for PTice
 Currents and Statements; to all persons engaged in Business, for
printing their own Circulars, Invoices, Statements, 4c. ; to Teachers,
for multiplying copies of lessons; and to Private Individuals it will
be found useful and amusing, in privately producing copies of their
own composition in poetry, prose, music, or drawing.
   The attention of the Exporter and Emigrant is particularly called
to the importance of this invention, for the Colonies and Foreign
Countries, when it is considered that in many places no printer is to
be found, and that in some countries, especially in the East, the com-
plication of the numerous Oriental characters renders i t necessary for
all documents to be multiplied by the tedious process of transcribing.
   The Press is manufactured in three sizes, and the whole apparatus
is contained in neat boxes, French-polished. The Patentees, feeling
 convinced of the great utility of this invention, and anticipating a
large sale, have determined upon offering them a t the following low
prices, which include every necessary, and full instructions :-
