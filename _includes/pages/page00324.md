         IMPROVED TRANSPARENT TRACING PAPER,
      Warranted of the very best material.               Samples will be sent free, upon a ~ l i c a t i o n .
     The following extracts from the "Art Union," and "Magazine of Science," will be sufficient
guarantee of the excellent quality of these papers, and the great celebrity to which they have attained :
    Art Union.-"Messrs. Waterlow and Sons' Tracing Paper is certainly the best we have ever tried, being per-
fectly transparent, though sufficientlythick for all practical purposes, and perfectly free from that oiliness we
generally meet with in paper of a similar description, taking the ink as readily as ordinary writing paper. I t
must be invaluable to all who require the use of such an article!'
    Magazine of Science.-" To those very numerous classes of the public-artists, architects,engineers, map-makers
pattern-drawers-indeed to all who, whether professionallyor otherwise, have occasion to employ tracingpape~
we would, with earnestness, urge the extreme worth and merits of that manufactured by Messrs. Waterlow and
Sons. In happy contrast to the paper of a like nature, too frequently to be met with, theirs is entirely devoid of
all nasty, unclean greasiness; it is thoroughly transparent, and can be traced over either by the pencil, or-a great
desideratum-by pen and ink. Assuredly this is a very admirable article."
