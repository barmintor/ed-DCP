                                    JANUARY.
   THEREis no month in the year when Winter has such entire sway as January. I t is termed by some
" the very hole of winter," and justly so, too. I t is then that the fanciful fret-work is seen to deaden and
decorate the window-panes, while Jack Frost, with his icy fingers, pencils his sketches. I t is in January
that all around is sad, gloomy and lifeless. Not a crocus is seen to show its early blossom, and not a
primrose sparkles in the eye. The very hyacinths in the windows seem fearful of showing anything but
their pendant roots.
   The evenings are cold, long and dreary ;and but for the prevailing festivities, there would be nothing to
comfortnothing to cheer. The balls and evening parties, however, with other rational entertainments,
do much to alleviate and enliven in this month.
   E. MOSESAND SONhave taken occasion to touch upon this month, in order to call attention to
those Winter articles, so essential for various purposes at this season of the year. For the inclemency of
the month E. Moses & SONhave warm and elegant Paletots in every variety.
   For the entertainments of the month the proprietors have fancy vests, coats, trousers, &c., as various
and numerous as a purchaser could wish to select from. E. MOSES& SONare confident that an inspection
will convince the reader of the immense superiority of their Winter articles over those of any other
House in the Trade ; and, consequently, they earnestly solicit the same at the earliest opportnnity.
