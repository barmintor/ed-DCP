                            THE WINTER OF 1814.

Two neighhours, meeting, talk'd about the cold,                 Which roasted a stupendous ox entire.
The one was young, and one was rather old.                      It was a most excltlng scene to qulz! "
"Good morning ( s a ~ dthe young one-Mr. Phizz,)                " So I should think" (sald Mr. P h ~ l ~Phizz).
                                                                                                         p
What's the best news? How cold the weather is ! ''              "Ah ! (said hls ft~end,addressing him again,)
"Yes (said the other,) it is rather cold.                       We'd not the benefit of MOSES'then;
But nothing likeit was in times of old.'                        How well would Mosas' winter coats have sold
This winter's not a fifteenth part so keen                      In such a season's memorable cold.
As that which happen'd in the year 'Fourteen j                  Many poor creatures suffered most severely
'Twas then the river Thames was frozen o'er,                    Through wlnter cloth~ugbelng sold so dearly.
While people pass'd on foot from shore to shore.                MOSESand SONwould certainly have been
The ships were all in icy fetters pinn'd,                       Of vast advantage in the year 'Fourteen.
Unable to be moved by tide or wind.                             But never mind ! we've got these tradesmen now,
Talk of cold wlnters ! that was one, I own,                     And that's a famous thing, you must allow.
'Twonld scarcely have disgraced the Frigid Zone.                I've just now been an over-coat to buy; "
Large fairs were held on Thames's icy floor,                    "Indeed (repl~edthe other,) so have I."
Throng'd by enormous crowds; and, what is more,                 Much more was sald by each, as you'll suppose,
Upon the ice was lit a 'furnace-fire'                           But, as I 've no more space my lines must close.
