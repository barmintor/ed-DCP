TO THE STATUE ON BLOOMSBURY CHURCH.
 E x c u s s my boldness, elevated Statue!             At this vast mart-the glory of the West-
 And learn why thus my pen i s pointed a t you.        Dress is dlsplay'd, the cheapest and the best.
 A mighty change-a wonderful reality-                  You must have seen, from your exalted spire,
 Has lately taken place in your locality.              What MOSEShere has shown us in attire.
 Improvement's wand, with pantomimic touch,            You also must have seen the crowds that press
 Has bid new scenes arise, and alter'd much            To purchase Messrs. MOSES'Winter Dress.
 That thickly peopled district where your pile         Never was such a stirring scene display'd
 Has firmly stood for such a length of while.          At any previous opening in the trade.
 Look down and see how great a work i s done,          The Braoch DBpbt, so near your noble church,
 Nor fail to view the mart of M. and S O N ;           Has never once been left, as in the lurch.
 Right close to you this mart is seen t o rise,        For such support (increasing day by day)
 A monument of trading enterprise.                     Mosss and SONtheir debt of thanks would pay.
 The vast establishment which thus you see             Their friends, while forming such a vast phalan;.
 Is hut a branch of that great trading tree,           Demand expressions of the warmest thanks;
 The fame of which has spread on ev'ry hand,           And Messrs. MOSESare resolved, in this,
 A trading house nnequall'd i n the land.              In no one point to prove themselves remiss.

   Cau~lorr.-E. M O S E S & SON regret having to guard the public against imposition ; but having heard
that the untradesmanlike falsehood of being connected with them, or, i t is the same concern, has been
resorted to i n many instances, and for obvious reasons, they beg to state they have no connexion withany
other House in or out of London, except their branch Establishments, 506,507, and 508, New Oxford
Street, and 2 and 3, Hart Street ; 36, Fargate, Sheffield ; and 19, Thornton's Buildings, Bradford,
Yorkshire ; and those who desire cheap and genuine Clothing, &C., should call at or send to the Minories
and Aldgste (opposite the Church), City, London ; or to the Branch Establishments as above.

     The Establishments are closed from sunset, Friday, till sunset, Saturday, when business
                                    is resumed till 12 o'clock.
